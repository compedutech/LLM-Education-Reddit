The quote made me reflect on how our education system has been tilted for the last 200 years towards ""filling the vessel"". It has been focused on providing us enough of an education that we could fulfill a role (originally a factory worker), but not exciting any of us to discover the world out there.

The brightest students often just need guidance, they can learn for themselves and come back when they need to ask questions. A great teacher is not as important for a great student, but for the struggling students.

With the Advent of ChatGPT we have a potential for personalized education, however more importantly we have the emergence of a new kind of knowledge workers.

Prompt Engineers

Prompt Engineers thrive off creativity, and benefit from polymathic tendencies, having a well developed worldview. 

I've been told that Philosophy is a dead subject, that science has taken over philosophy, even my previous university has all but removed the 'Arts' from their service offering, yet the decision always seems to be made by a marketer, looking for more dollars, rather than a philosopher looking at the past to predict the future. 

The world's obsession with STEM has been necessary, though it made a generation of sharp knives. Where science allows us to dissect nature like a knife, and because of this we've uncovered so many truths. But in this new era AI is finding patterns that we cannot see, we need less knives, and more flames, more light. Philosophy is our flame, each question we asks shines light on a new path of discovery. This is why the highest order of a degree is called a Philosophical Doctorate, you're asking a detailed question to push the dial forward on collective knowledge.

As our AI models get better, human's won't be the sole players in adding to humanities collective understanding, in navigating the unknown unknowns.

It will be those who have well developed known knowns (Worldview), and the curiosity and courage explore their known unknowns, who will push the boundaries with the help of AI in new discoveries of our unknown unknowns.

The skill of the future is going to be our ability to question things. Kids are the best at questioning things, but us adults need humility to accept we don't know, that we aren't God's even if our children think we are. If we learn humility when they ask us questions, we can make their minds far superior than ours as it is their curiosity that fills in the gaps of knowledge of their worldview.

Asking why allows us to dig deeper into our understanding of things, eventually we will reach a question we can't answer. It is at that point that we must begin to explore.

It's like a surgery for the metaphysics of our worldview, each question allows us to carefully place and connect ideas in a delicate and surgical manner.

13xaf63,1,2023-06-01,Recommended Study Resources and Strategies for CSIR-NET Preparation,u/VW2001,CSIR_UGC_NET_JRF_LS,https://www.reddit.com/r/CSIR_UGC_NET_JRF_LS/comments/13xaf63/recommended_study_resources_and_strategies_for/,"Hey there, fellow CSIR-NET aspirants!

Today, let's discuss some recommended study resources and strategies that can help us excel in our CSIR-NET preparation. Whether you're just starting or already deep into your studies, these tips might give you some new insights. Let's jump right in!

1. **Start with a Practice Paper**: 

Before diving into any study resource, I highly recommend solving at least one CSIR-NET previous year paper. This will help you assess your current knowledge level, identify weak areas, and set a benchmark for measuring your progress throughout your preparation journey. It also familiarizes you with the question pattern and allows you to approach your studies with a purpose.

2. **Avoid Rote Learning of Standard Books**: 

Instead of relying solely on rote learning from standard textbooks, focus on understanding concepts deeply. Mere information retention without a purpose can lead to forgetfulness. CSIR-NET requires a targeted approach, so focus on learning from a question paper perspective. This way, you train yourself to solve specific types of problems and questions that commonly appear in the exam.

**3. Join Study Groups and Online Communities:**

Collaborating with fellow aspirants can be immensely helpful. Consider joining study groups or online communities where you can share your progress, exchange resources, and discuss challenging topics. Telegram groups, such as  https://t.me/csir\_lifescience, can provide a supportive environment and access to valuable study materials that might otherwise be costly or hard to find.

**4. Leverage the Power of ChatGPT:** 

Don't forget about the incredible resource at our fingertips—ChatGPT! Smart utilization of this language model can help clarify doubts, provide explanations, and offer insights on complex topics. However, remember to use it as a supplementary tool and always cross-verify information with reliable sources.

**5. Read References for In-depth Understanding:**

As many of us are postgraduate students who have already studied our subjects during coursework, it's essential to approach CSIR-NET preparation with the right mindset. Instead of starting from scratch, focus on using references selectively. When encountering unfamiliar topics, refer to appropriate resources to gain a deeper understanding. This will save you time while ensuring you have the necessary knowledge to tackle CSIR-NET questions effectively.

For free previous year questions (specifically for life sciences), you can visit: https://ifasonline.com/csir-net-life-science/previous-year-question-papers.jsp. Practicing with previous year papers is crucial as it familiarizes you with the exam format and helps you understand the question trends.

Remember, CSIR-NET preparation is a journey that requires consistent effort. Practice regularly, even if progress seems slow at times. Small steps forward accumulate to significant achievements. Treat your preparation like a one-day match, where every day of study counts towards the final victory.

Feel free to share your own recommended study resources, tips, or any questions you may have in the comments below. Let's support each other on this challenging yet rewarding path towards CSIR-NET success!

Good luck, and keep up the amazing work!

13xc8ev,9,2023-06-01,Heated Argument With a Dear Friend Over Vectors and the Speed of Light,u/StegoFF,AskPhysics,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPhysics/comments/13xc8ev/heated_argument_with_a_dear_friend_over_vectors/,"Hello and thanks for your time. I'm having a challenging time with a close friend that is insisting on a few math/physics related beliefs to the point that our relationship is suffering. They are becoming upset at me thinking I am to stubborn to admit I am wrong, however, on my end I feel so strongly in my understanding.  I'm not able to just back down or agree with them due to a dynamic of our relationship, they are an important person in my life who I care about, however, they are enabled to treat me like I'm an idiot, talk to me in a mocking voice, tell me I'm stupid, and they can't tolerate or believe that I would hold these thoughts, so while this might sound childish, it's not something I can walk away from and I have to hold my ground and not just give in.  I'd appreciate any advice and perhaps a sanity check validating one or the other of us so I know how to approach this.

The argument revolves around the speed of light and the difference between a scalar and a vector.  Any website forum like quora/reddit or educational websites for students they scoff at, as well as chatgpt. As such I don't know how to convey anything.

My friend believe these two things:

# Meter is a Vector not a Scalar

My friend believes that a meter is the only measurement of distance that is able to be a vector since it's standardized. They use this quote from wiki to verify this fact:

[https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Physics\_with\_Calculus/Mechanics/Scalar\_and\_Vector\_Quantities#:\~:text=The%20only%20basic%20SI%20unit,in%20its%20definition%20and%20unit](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Physics_with_Calculus/Mechanics/Scalar_and_Vector_Quantities#:~:text=The%20only%20basic%20SI%20unit,in%20its%20definition%20and%20unit)

>The only basic SI unit that is a vector is the meter. All others are scalars. Derived quantities can be vector or scalar, but every vector quantity must involve meters in its definition and unit.

I have to be honest when I read this quote in wiki it is quite odd. It can be read that a meter somehow becomes a vector simply due to standardization. Due to this my friend feels very strongly they are correct.

I believe a Meter is a scalar showing length/distance and convertible to any unit of lenght/distance. I've brought up points such as how could an alien society do physics without having access to a meter since it's an arbitrary human unit and this got the retort with examples like ""if you are following a recipe and use ounces instead of grams that the recipe would come out wrong"". To give them credit I believe what they think is that the laws of physics have the standardized metric system baked in to the calculations and don't understand that these laws are expressed in formulas that take parameters and the constants can be converted to equivalent units.

# Speed of Light is a Velocity:

My friend believes the speed of light is a velocity which implies it's a vector and they can show that Speed of Light is classified as a velocity in many prominent places on the internet, which solidified their argument. Beyond this their argument is based around the fact that ""meters per second"" encases the vector inside of it. In my mind speed of light has no directional component and is a scalar showing magnitude not a vector. 

# Combining the Two Above to a Proof

By combining these two things together my friend has a full proof argument where even if speed of light is listed as ""Meters Per Second"" and is presented as a single number scalar the fact that ""meters"" is included imbues it with a vector property since Wiki states ""The only basic SI unit that is a vector is the meter. "" This puts me in a checkmate where as far as information on the internet, they do have a point, that you could derive their proof or conclusion purely from reading top search results and wiki. According to the internet they are correct.

&#x200B;

I work as a programmer and do some things with 3D math and physics engines so have an understanding of vectors and scalars, and the mathmatics around them such as magnitude etc, but i mainly use vectors in 3D spatial programs. Since this is more science related I'm aware that my math/terms might be only applicable to certain 3D systems but not space/time physics. I do however believe so strongly in my ideas here and I'm quite shocked and what a disconnect I have in world view from my friend. If I'm absolutely delusional I'd like to hear it and accept reality and if not the sanity check would help me perhaps."

13xe9kz,5,2023-06-01,how do i deal with groupmates or should i deal with myself first?,u/baethatiskindanerdy,PinoyProgrammer,https://www.reddit.com/r/PinoyProgrammer/comments/13xe9kz/how_do_i_deal_with_groupmates_or_should_i_deal/," 

Okay so **we were tasked to create a program about functions and arrays**, and it was hell week, grabe activities like we were so stacked and overwhelmed. **I told my groupmates** (although i ain't the leader) **to start creating the flow of the program since 2 days nalang deadline na.** So they said that they're going to work it out the day before the submission. As a **high-achieving student**, I started to make the algorithm already so they could atleast do the logic for the specifications na needed for each function. But like what happened it that they didn't bother to analyze my code properly and sinabi nalang nila na **""Ay flow pala yung ginawa mo, not yung whole program""**. What really? I could make that program way more faster, it's just that I want everyone to have a task assigned to them since the prof asked us to provide the contributions of each member. Yung 2 members nga natin walang ginagawa, you guys should've asked them to do something.

So ayon kanina **they were asking the logic about the specifications** and since **I really want this to end**, **I finished the whole program and asked them if it's sufficient enough and if they can debug it** also. But **this another member** (who asked earlier) **made an another program** that is I think, **way better than my program but there is a reason why mine's underwhelming.**

Doon sa instruction, sinasabi na **""This quiz is used to measure your knowledge about arrays and functions""**, and based on my own understanding, **dapat kami yung gumawa ng logic ng program.** **But may one specification kasi doon that is not clear, which is to randomly generate characters and hindi naman yon na-teach ni prof.** Based din sa research namin, need namin gumamit ng other libraries so it's obvious na **we used chatgpt for that (since yun din ginawa nila).** **But my program's array is fixed,** like nag-declare and initialize lang ako base doon sa values on the program output from the instructions. Because I think that the prof wants to know if we know how to make these fundamentals work.

Pinaayos ko rin yung code kasi ang pangit ng naming ng variables. Super clear na nga sa instruction to use a specific array name which is provided ni Sir but iba pa rin ginamit. SMH.

**The group decided to pass nalang yung code ng groupmate ko**, which means that my code will be disregarded. **IDK, ouch lang siguro from my ego.** I know hindi ako ganoon kagaling when it comes to programming but I know how to follow instructions. I don't really want to use chatgpt for adding something na hindi naman naturo because for me it's like cheating? Or cheating lang siya because of my perspective?

So ayon, **am I the problem since my ego is hurt or my groupmates din?** All criticisms are welcome haha, I just wanna know if ako problem or not. Feel ko both sides?"

13xmgdn,6,2023-06-01,Banning ChatGPT in Classrooms is a Disservice to Students,u/beehive-learning,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/13xmgdn/banning_chatgpt_in_classrooms_is_a_disservice_to/," **Educators need to take control of AI tools in their classroom.** 

Since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, the way we learn, work,  and communicate has taken a seismic shift. It’s clear that teachers cannot stop the adoption of AI tools.

I tutor students between 10th grade and seniors in college, and I have a secret to tell you: **most of them are already using ChatGPT for their assignments.** They have found ways to make their usage undetectable by plagiarism checkers, simply by changing a few words and phrases. 

Who can blame them? When used correctly, these technologies can make *all* of our lives easier.

It’s time for teachers to embrace these technologies and take control  of the narrative. By learning how to constructively use AI tools in the  classroom, we have the potential to improve the lives of teachers and  the quality of education we provide to our students.

## AI Does Not Automatically Create A+ Outputs

First and foremost, we need to dispel the misconception that AI tools can effortlessly generate excellent results.

We treat AI like some almighty god that can do any task. This is your  reminder that AI tools are nothing without human input (not yet, at  least 😉). 

Also, AI tools are **not** search engines. If a student were to prompt ChatGPT with “write an essay on Of Mice and Men,” [the output](https://chat.openai.com/share/ebf80943-f4c5-433f-a8fa-2914c2057f20)  would be off-topic, resulting in a B paper. While that query is  appropriate for the age of search engines, AI tools respond to that  prompt with a generic response.

There is a field of study called [“prompt engineering,”](https://www.udemy.com/course/prompt-engineering-with-chatgpt/?referralCode=9A46EA04FDD14E591A4C)  which focuses on creating and refining high-quality prompts for AI.  Just like in life, the concept of “garbage in, garbage out” applies  here. Constructing high-quality prompts can significantly improve the  performance of AI models on specific tasks.

However, even after learning the skills of prompt engineering,  students will not be able to create a final draft of an essay, ready to  be copied and pasted into Turnitin.com. 

Even if a student uses AI for an essay, there is still work to be  done. Checking facts, restructuring the content, and rephrasing  sentences are essential steps to make it an A+ paper with strong sources  and robust arguments. These skills were important 30 years ago, and  they are still important today.

We need to teach students to use these tools to prepare them for the  modern workforce. This requires identifying the skills that are still  relevant with AI, like critical thinking, persuasive writing, and  problem solving, and the ones that are no longer relevant, like writing  the first draft of an essay and rote memorization.

## The Nature of the Workforce is Changing

Throughout our history, technological advancements have constantly  reshaped the definition of work – not only what we do, but how we do it.  Ultimately, technological advancements are deflationary *–* they *decrease* the cost of doing something. 

As noted in Bradley Sacks’ newsletter from Semafor, the number of  workers needed to generate $1 million in revenue has decreased from  eight in the late 1980’s to a mere **two** today. But what does this really mean?

&#x200B;

Over this time period, innovations like computers, software, and AI  have increased the productivity of the average worker. Ultimately, this  increased productivity reflects a **shift in the type of labor required***.* It’s less about manually intensive tasks and more about knowledge-based, creative, and complex problem-solving tasks. 

It’s high time that teachers begin to incorporate the important  skills and tools of the last three decades into their classrooms. We are  *not* setting kids up for success by teaching them trigonometry  on a brick-sized Texas Instruments calculator they’ll never use after  high school. How about teaching them how to do it on a spreadsheet?

Ultimately, the workforce our children will be entering will be  dramatically different from the one we know today. AI is a unique  technological leap because it is the first time that *reasoning* has  been automated. For the first time ever, our technologies can make  judgements, create assumptions, and generate novel creative works.

Since AI models are *never* 100% accurate, the core skills of  creativity, critical thinking, problem solving, and retrieving  information from reliable sources are still as important as they have  ever been. These parts of the curriculum are not under threat.

As our students enter a changing world, it would be a disservice to  them to keep teaching them in the same ways as we always have. The core  curriculum must evolve to meet the demands of the modern era, where more  can be done with less.

## AI Can Improve Student Outcomes

The [“2 sigma problem”](https://web.mit.edu/5.95/readings/bloom-two-sigma.pdf)  was a study conducted by educational psychologist Benjamin Bloom in  1984. Bloom sought to investigate the impact of one-on-one tutoring on  student performance compared to traditional classroom instruction. 

In his study, **Bloom found that students who received  personalized one-on-one tutoring performed at a level approximately two  standard deviations (2 sigmas) above the average of students in  traditional classroom settings**. This means that the students who received tutoring achieved significantly higher outcomes compared to their peers.

It implies that tutoring has the power to transform an average  student into an exceptional one and lift below-average students to  above-average levels of achievement.

However, he called it the “2 sigma problem” because it was  economically infeasible to provide one-on-one tutoring to every student.  Traditional tutoring methods are resource-intensive and often limited  in reach due to constraints such as time, availability, and cost. 

For the first time in history, we have the opportunity to solve the  “2 sigma problem,” since AI technologies make one-on-one tutoring  economically viable. Think of an AI as an intelligent, personalized  tutor who could deliver individualized instruction and support.

For example, an AI could provide a detailed walkthrough of a  difficult question, or generate a first draft of an essay, or generate  an adaptive assessment perfect for the student’s level of understanding.  These services were only available to the rich, but with new leaps in  AI, we now have the unique opportunity of delivering this experience to  everyone and improving student outcomes.

If you’re interested in seeing how AI tools can be used as personalized tutors, check out [this TED talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJP5GqnTrNo&t=128s).  In the talk, Sal Khan demonstrates the capabilities of the new AI tutor  Khanmigo, showcasing the potential it holds for transforming education.

## Don’t Ban, Harness the Potential of AI Tools

The time is now to adapt our approach to education and embrace AI  tools. Banning them would deny students the opportunity to learn how to  responsibly use these technologies and navigate a rapidly changing  world. By embracing AI, teachers can empower students to excel, prepare  them for the modern workforce, and improve student outcomes.

13xrb0r,43,2023-06-01,TriMet's problems are exponentially worse than anyone is talking about,u/fidelityportland,PortlandOR,https://www.reddit.com/r/PortlandOR/comments/13xrb0r/trimets_problems_are_exponentially_worse_than/,"Public opinion of TriMet's decisions have been pretty mixed, mostly because TriMet's decisions are so convoluted that they can be a real challenge to understand. In reality, Metro and Portlanders need to have a bigger civic conversation about the future of TriMet, looking at the big picture. We have 3 looming existential crises of TriMet to be concerned about that are bigger than revenue dips, crime, or homeless people.
 
Civic leaders and the public are focused on a quick ""fix"" for TriMet revenue drops - even though we've seen this coming for a long time, it's very predictable that TriMet's Board of Directors acts at the last minute. Also, very predictably, TriMet's Board opted for a fare increase because over the previous 20 years that's been a go-to answer to every problem (except for that one time they killed Fareless Square). The politically appointed boards of TriMet and Metro lack the unique specialized knowledge of the issues I'll bring up here. If TriMet knows about these larger issues, they're obviously burring it from public view. In the short term, increasing fares is like putting fresh paint on a house that's on fire; in this situation, that paint is HIGHLY flammable.
 
First - fare hikes as a tactic is a brain-dead move. Just the most utterly stupid and self-sabotaging response to a looming budget shortfall. I'm dwelling on this because it illustrates their terrible decision-making, which is functional proof they have no idea what they're doing. Some of the core reasons for this:
 
- Increasing fares reduces utilization. Higher cost means fewer people ride, which will decrease the ridership revenue. It will also marginally increase the number of people who won't pay (funny story, *some* of those who don't pay actually can't afford to). TriMet isn't a monopoly or inelastic service, and plenty of other choices exist that didn't exist 20 years ago: an actual bike share, scooters, electric bikes, Uber/Lyft, shared vehicles, and more bike paths. Before the pandemic, it was common that I would bus into downtown for work and then take a Lyft home because it wasn't all that expensive, like $8 more than a bus ride - TriMet's price increases make a system that wasn't very competitive simply less compelling.
 
- Across Portland we need to go through a process of austerity and downsizing government. I absolutely support Wheeler putting a pause on rate increases, but for God's sake, we have far too much largesse in every layer of government. If you need to learn what I'm talking about, read my old article on [Parks & Rec](https://fidelitypdx.substack.com/p/wheres-the-evidence-that-portland). So many divisions/agencies have doubled their staff while reducing service levels. It's bonkers. Cutting throats needs to be an imperative. This is because the great majority of public sector employees in Oregon and Portland are incompetent, redundant, and only exist because Oregon and Portland have been reluctant to use automation. And I don't mean the cutting-edge AI stuff, I'm talking about people who still handle business processes as if they're *paper forms*. I could tell so many stories from my professional experience - but you'll have to take my word for it for now: culling this bureaucracy is the right move, and until there's a significant downsizing, the political class is taking none of the financial crisis or cost of living situation seriously.
 
- TriMet's operating budget/revenue is primarily Payroll Taxes, not passenger revenue. About 20-30% of TriMet's budget comes from people buying fares, whereas the bulk of money TriMet needs comes from payroll taxes that businesses pay directly. Because of this, transit activists (including myself) have been proponents of increasing the payroll taxes marginally to make TriMet free for riders. Of course, fareless transit comes with a wide variety of new and different problems (*that's an article for another time*). Still, when you understand that only a sliver of revenue comes from fares, increasing the fare simply results in a marginal increase in revenue. The much bigger problem is going to businesses investing outside of Metro, and changing workforces that 1) won't pay payroll taxes reliably, 2) don't need people to go into the office. Think about the longer-term game here: is TriMet's board going to increase fares as utilization drops and payroll taxes continually diminish? (See my point above about how their default answer is ""yes"" because it's the only politically expedient answer.)
 
Reading comments about the fare hikes, most of the public thinks TriMet is dealing with a safety or utilization issue. Both of these are 100% true: soft-on-crime progressives have wholly obliterated the working class perception of TriMet safety - there are so many different ways this has happened, but we should thank so many people in the media and political class: Ana del Rocio's crying wolf about racism in fare inspections (and the media entertaining it), or Mike Schmidt deinstitutionalizing of the justice system, or Legislature's inability to act on the massive mental health crisis and drug addiction crisis in Oregon. No matter the underlying cause, we have a system where deranged violent mentally ill tweakers can be disruptive on the train, but working-class people face a $250 fine if they can't afford a ~~$2.50~~ ($2.80) ticket. TriMet is less safe, especially the light rail and bus lines. We could hypothetically talk about various policy and infrastructure changes, such as turnstiles and security guards - but pragmatically, this won't do shit when our society has adopted a philosophy of transforming the urban core into an open-air insane asylum and opened the doors to the prisons. This safety issue is well beyond TriMet's scope, and even if there was consensus among TriMet and Metro to solve this, the entire justice system and Legislature is still broken.
 
##**Fare Hikes and Utilization is the Red Herring - Let's talk about TriMet's future**
 
In reality, multiple design choices made decades ago set us up for failure. But we also have to thank brain-dead progressive lunatics and corrupt politicos who have steered our transit decision-making into the ground.
 
There are three specific issues I'm going to talk about, with each becoming more consequential and disastrous for TriMet:
 
- Hub and Spoke Design and the need for a redesign of the entire system to fit new commuting/transit patterns
 
- Portland Light Rail's short cars are a capacity problem not worth the price tag to fix
 
- Autonomous vehicles are here, and it's just going to get worse for TriMet
 
##**The strategic design of TriMet's system is broken, and it's been broken before.**
 
If you looked at a map of TriMet's bus and rail system, you'd see a design pattern often referred to as a ""Radial Design"" or sometimes a ""Hub And Spoke"" design. The Hub and Spoke strategy is building our transit system around centralized locations to connect to other routes. For Portland the idea is to go downtown (or sometimes a Park and Ride) where you can connect to your next destination. This is why the majority of bus routes and all the max routes go downtown, to our Transit Mall and Pioneer Square.
 
Downtown planning was a smart idea in the 1960s when it was coupled with Main Street economic theory and prototype urban development zones - all of this wrapped up in the 1972 Downtown Plan policy. During these decades, the primary economic idea of urban revitalization was that downtown cores could provide better business climates and shopping districts that amplify economic activity synergistically. In other words, packing all the office jobs and luxury shopping in one area is good for workers, business, and civic planning.
 
All very smart ideas in yester-year, so TriMet became focused on serving the downtown business community myopically. This myopia became so paramount that it was considered illegitimate (actually taboo, borderline illegal) if you used a Park & Ride facility to park and NOT ride downtown. Amanda Fritz once explained that we couldn't expand Barbur Transit Center because that would result in students parking at Barbur Transit Center and riding the bus to PCC Sylvania. This view implies that TriMet exists only to service downtown workers, not the students, not the impoverished mom needing to go to a grocery store.
 
How does TriMet's hub and spoke design represent its purpose?
 
Portland's unspoken rule of transit philosophy is that jobs pay for the system (remember, business payroll taxes pay for most of it), so TriMet should be focused on serving people utilizing it for their job - employers pay for it, and they get value out of it. But this is both unspoken (never said aloud) and largely unobserved. The whole idea of TriMet as a social service to serve low-income people, to help impoverished people - well, those ideas were just lukewarm political rhetoric that is tossed out as soon as some *Undesirable* with tattered clothing reeking of cigarettes gets aboard - then Portlanders jump right back ""this is for workers only!"" Sadly, there hasn't ever been a public consensus of why TriMet exists because I could equally argue that TriMet's purpose isn't serving the working class; it's actually vehicle emissions reductions - but here, too, reality contradicts that this is the purpose for why we operate TriMet. TriMet's real purpose seems to be ""Spend money on lofty capital projects"" and if we want to be cynical about it, we can elaborate ""*…because large capital projects enable grift, embezzlement, and inflating property values for developers.*""
 
We haven't always depended upon a hub and spoke design. A great article from Jarrett Walker written in 2010 on his Human Transit blog explains in ""[The Power and Pleasure of Grids](https://humantransit.org/2010/02/the-power-and-pleasure-of-grids.html)""
 
> Why aren't all frequent networks grids? The competing impulse is the radial network impulse, which says: ""We have one downtown. Everyone is going there, so just run everything to there."" Most networks start out radial, but some later transition to more of a grid form, often with compromises in which a grid pattern of routes is distorted around downtown so that many parallel routes converge there. You can see this pattern in many cities, Portland for example. Many of the lines extending north and east out of the city center form elements of a grid, but converge on the downtown. Many other major routes (numbered in the 70s in Portland's system) do not go downtown, but instead complete the grid pattern. This balance between grid and radial patterns was carefully constructed in 1982, replacing an old network in which almost all routes went downtown.
 
Over the years the grid pattern was neglected in favor of a downtown-focused investment strategy. To a real degree it made practical sense: that's where the jobs were. But again, this is the presumption that TriMet and Mass Transit ought to service workers first, and there's not much consensus on that. But while we can't decide on TriMet's purpose, we can absolutely agree on one important thing: ***Downtown is dead.***
 
No 5-star hotel is going to fix it. (As of writing, I'm not even convinced that this mafia-connected bamboozle of public fraud will open.) No ""tough-on-crime"" DA to replace Mike Schmidt, like Nathan Vasquez, will fix downtown. It's not JUST a crime problem: most of the problems we deal with today mirror the problems facing Portland in the 1960s, especially our inability to invest in good infrastructure people actually want to use. That's on top of crime, vandalism, and an unhealthy business ecosystem.
 
***IF*** we want to maintain TriMet (and that's a big IF, for reasons I'll explain below), then it will be focused on something other than downtown. We need to move back to a grid-design transit system, as this is a much easier way to use transit to get around the city, no matter your destination. If TriMet continues to exist and operate fleets in 20-30 years, this is the only way it exists - because it will just be too inconvenient to ride downtown as a side quest to your destination, especially as we look at 10, 20, 30, 40 years from now.
 
Of course, we can only transform some parts of the transit infrastructure this way, and there are no uplifting and moving train tracks here. So light rail doesn't have a future in the grid system - but even without the grid system, light rail is doomed.
 
##**The fatal flaws of light rail in Portland.**
 
I want to preface this by saying *I like light rail as a strategy*, it's not a bad system or bad civic investment. I could write another 5,000-word essay on why Seattle did an excellent job with light rail and the specific decisions Portland made wildly incorrectly. In transit advocacy the wacktavists inappropriately categorized skeptics of Portland's light rail as some soft bigotry - as if you're racist if you don't like Portland's light rail - even though, ironically, most light rail systems tend to be built for the preference of white culture and white workers, precisely what happened here in Portland and most cities (but this is all a story for another time).
 
**Portland's light rail system has a capacity problem and has dealt with this capacity problem quietly for the last 20+ years.** When you see the capacity problem, you can quickly understand this light rail system won't work in the future. All the other smart cities in the world that designed light rail realized they needed big long trains to move many people. Portland decided to limit the train car length to the size of our city blocks to save construction costs - and this has always been a fatal flaw.
 
Portland's highest capacity train car is our Type 5, [according to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TriMet_rolling_stock) it has a seating capacity of 72 and an overall capacity of 186 per ~~train~~ *car, meaning each train can accommodate up to 372, but even these numbers seem unreliable* (*edit). Let's compare:
 
- Washington DC has 6-car trains capable of carrying 120 passengers per car, or 720 per train.
 
- Salt Lake City has a 4-car train capable of carrying 230 passengers per car, or 920 per train.
 
- Seattle's Link system has a 3 or 4-car train, each capable of carrying approximately 200 passengers per car, so 600 to 800 per train.
 
Portland's light rail lines have roughly the same people moving capacity as *a single lane* of a highway, maybe marginally more, maybe marginally less. These other cities have a light rail system that can move the same amount of people *as an entire 3-lane highway.* 
 
You might suspect that Portland could simply run trains more frequently - but nah, that's impossible because the trains run through the central core of downtown Portland, and they're blocked by the real interfaces with road traffic and bottlenecks. TriMet/PBOT/Metro has offered rosy ideas that we could hypothetically run cars every 90 seconds, 2 minutes, 4 minutes, or 6 minutes (depending upon who you ask) - but these are garbage numbers invented out of thin air. For example, you could stand at Pioneer Courthouse Square at 4:50pm on a Wednesday in 2016 - there was a train opening doors to load passengers, and you could visibly see the next train at Pioneer Place Mall pulling into the station behind. Trains were running at approximately a 3 to 4 minute at peak - but on paper, TriMet will claim anything, as they don't give a shit about lying to the public. But the bigger problem is that **trains were full.** You might have to wait 90 minutes to find a train that offers a seat. And god forbid you had a bike.
 
I'm not making this very real capacity problem, [Metro even acknowledges](https://www.oregonmetro.gov/max-tunnel-study):
 
> At the busiest hours of the day, 40 light rail trains must cross the river and traverse downtown – one train every 90 seconds. As the region grows and the demand for light rail increases, the region will need at least 64 MAX trains through downtown every hour, more than one train each minute. Our current system can't support that change.
 
Suppose you're silly enough to trust government propaganda. In that case, you can read [the details of Metro study on this in 2019](https://www.oregonmetro.gov/sites/default/files/2019/10/25/MAX%20Tunnel%20Study%20Findings.pdf). If we assumed their numbers added up, it's just fucking impossible to run 62 trains per hour, because passenger loading and unloading can take a full minute (sometimes longer). So unless we want to apply substantial g-forces onto the passengers, the train isn't accelerating out of the stops fast enough. Not to mention how unreliable this whole system would be if a sole tweaker, bike rider, or person with a stroller held up the system for 2 minutes.
 
This is why the bottom line needs to be upfront about capacity - quoting Metro's study here:
 
> ***Today MAX is limited to 2-car trains because of the length of downtown city blocks. A tunnel could allow for longer trains if the stations outside the downtown core are retrofitted***. In the long-term, this could greatly increase MAX capacity.
 
Do you see that trick? Build a tunnel, yes - but the entire system has to be retrofitted. Literally every light rail station would need to be redesigned, the lines themselves recalculated for larger heavier trains - and extending platforms at Willow Creek might be simple enough, but how in the living fuck is Metro going to afford to expand the Zoo stop? Doubling the size of that platform would cost $500 million alone.
 
If the city weren't full of cheap dipshits, we would have elevated or buried our light rail lines in the 1980s or 90s, enabling longer train cars to run. Yes, we all knew back then that it was the best practice not to have light rail running on the street - it's less safe, less reliable, runs slower, and limits train car size. *Oops.*
 
Just to keep TriMet's own bullshit inflated utopian vision, it would mean spending another billion dollars just to unfuck downtown, bypass an aging bridge, and potentially allow a marginally higher volume of trains - which again is a band-aid on a mortal wound.
 
The real buried lede is that **to add extra train cars means retrofitting all the stops in the system** - that's ***tens of billions of dollars***. You can argue costs, but Metro knows we need to do this. It means shutting down the system for a year or years while construction and retrofits happen. It's fucking outrageous. Is this system worth of people per line worth 20, 30, or 40 billion dollars? Fuck no, it ain't. Again, if we had a raging metropolis of industry and commerce downtown, we could reasonably entertain the idea for a moment - but we don't and never will again.
 
Some folks might argue that if we kill off the light rail system we'd lose out on all those lucrative Transit Oriented Developments. Originally the public was told that Transit Oriented Development strategy would cause a massive infusion of private investment because the light rail was so damn lucrative and desirable for Richard Florida's Creative Class. Turns out the Creative Class is now called today the Laptop Class, and they don't give a flying fuck about street cars, light rail, or walking scores - because most can't be bothered to put pants on during their ""commute"" from bed to desk. TOD was all a fantasy illusion from the beginning, as multiple studies about Portland commuters showed that college-educated white folks riding Max were equally comfortable riding their bike as a substitute for the same commute. All of these billions of dollars was to accommodate white fare-weather bikers. So here's my hot take on transit: pave over the rail lines and put in bike lanes, and boy, then you'd have a bike system to give folks like Maus a hardon. But of course, Bike Portland would complain because their focus isn't biking; they exist only to favor all poorly thought utopian transit ideas.
 
Another group of Max/TOD advocates would claim that TOD is better for disabled and impoverished people. And yeah, there's truth there, but see my entire argument above about the Hub & Spoke design of TriMet being the antithesis of transit as a social service. If you believe that TriMet should serve low-income people, you must advocate for a bus-centric grid design.
 
But even if you're a die-hard believer in light rail - there's another inevitable reality coming that is the nail in the coffin.
 
##**Autonomous vehicles will replace mass transit faster than the automobile replaced the horse.**
 
I work in advanced technology, and the thing about tech is that the public and politicians deny that it's going to be there until the majority of the public finally experiences it. You could say this about personal computers, internet, cloud compute, electric cars, smartphones, distributed ledger (cryptocurrency), AI, and driverless vehicles.
 
Schrodinger's technology doesn't exist until it's measured in an Apple store or your mother asks you for tech support.
 
No one thought AI *was really* real until ChatGPT did their kid's homework, and today most people are coming to terms with the fact that ChatGPT 3.5 could do most people's jobs. And that's not even the most advanced AI, that's the freeware put out by Microsoft, they have paywalls to access the real deal.
 
In 2018 I rode in my colleague's Tesla in self-driving mode from downtown Portland to Top Golf in Hillsboro. We started our journey at the surface parking lot on the west side of the Morrison Bridge. He used his phone to tell the car to pull out of the parking spot and to pick us up. Then he gave the car the address, and it drove us the entire way without any human input necessary. The only time he provided feedback was to touch the turn signal to pass a slow car on the highway. People think self-driving isn't here - but it is - and it's gotten exponentially better and will continue to do so. People will complain and moan about idealized, utopian, pedantic ""level 5"" full self-driving, how none of it exists or could exist, as a Tesla passes them on the road and the driver is half asleep.
 
Of course, Portland and every major city have also thought deeply about self-driving technology, and a few places have implemented self-driving solutions - but so far, none of these are really at scale. Though it will be a short time before cost-conscious cities go all-in.
 
TriMet kicked around the idea of using an autonomous bus for a leg of the trip of the Southwest Corridor project, connecting a segment of the light rail route to the community college. It was bafflingly stupid and short-sighted to think they could use it in this niche application but that it wouldn't open the floodgates for a hundred different applications that eviscerate TriMet's labor model. The simplest example of autonomous operation would be to operate the light rail systems - because they don't make turns, all we need is an AI vision service to slam on the breaks if necessary - that technology has existed for 20+ years. We could retrofit the entire train system in about 3 to 6 months - replace every Max operator with a security guard, and maybe people would ride the Max again? But I digress.
 
**Let's speculate about the far-future, some 5, 10, or 20 years from now:** your transit options will expand significantly. The cost will decrease considerably for services using automated vehicles.
 
You'll look at your options as:
 
- **Drive to work:** fastest, takes $100+ worth of gas a month, but you also need $50+ for insurance and $500+ for the monthly car payment, plus those surprise maintenance and broken windows. Also, do you pay for parking? Pick a number for how much it costs to drive your personally owned and manually operated vehicle to work each month. 
 
- **Autonomous vehicle service:** price TBA, but think of how much an Uber costs when you don't have to pay the driver, you don't have to pay for gas. An Uber that runs for $20 today would likely be $10 or less. So, to and from work 20 times a month, $200. $300? Ok, let's just say it's $400 a month. *It's still all cheaper than owning a car and driving it to work.* No parking fees, and it picks you up quickly enough that it's not a nuisance.
 
- **Mass Transit:** $150 per month, but ugghhh it's slow, it smells like piss, a guy jacked off in your hair, and you can't schedule a meeting for the first 30 minutes of your anticipated workday in case you miss a connection - and it breaks so often the government actively hides the reliability data from the public and media.
 
Just a few years into this future we'll see a brand new trend, one that already exists: a shared autonomous vehicle like a privately operated bus. For example, Uber Bus - it already exists as a commuter option in some cities, it's just not autonomous yet. The significant benefit of an autonomous bus is that these shared vehicles will utilize HOV lanes very commonly, and commuting in an autonomous vehicle will be as fast as driving to work in your manually operated car while also being less expensive.
 
Simultaneously automobile accidents in autonomous vehicles will be virtually non-existent, and insurance companies will start to increase prices on vehicles that lack AI/smart assisted safety driving features. Public leaders will see the value of creating lanes of traffic on highways dedicated explicitly to autonomous vehicles so that they can drive at much higher speeds than manually operated traffic. Oregon won't lead the way here, but wait until Texas or one of the Crazy States greenlights a speed limit differential, and self-driving vehicles have a speed limit of 90, 120, or 150 miles per hour. You might think ""accidents would be terrible and deadly"" but there will be fewer accidents in the autonomous lane than in manual lanes. At this point, it will be WAY faster to take an autonomous vehicle to your work.
 
Purchasing power of consumers will decrease while the cost of vehicles will increase (especially autonomous vehicles), making ownership of any vehicle less likely. Frankly, the great majority of people won't know how to drive and will never learn to - just like how young people today don't know how to use manual transmission. However, fleets of autonomous vehicles owned by companies like Tesla, Uber, and Lyft will benefit from scale and keep their autonomous bus fleets operating at low cost. This will lead to a trend where fewer and fewer people will own an automobile, and fewer people even bother learning how to drive or paying the enormous insurance cost.... while also depending upon automobiles more than we do today. 
 
Eventually, in the distant future, manually driven vehicles will be prohibited in urban areas as some reckless relic from a bygone era.
 
Cities and public bodies don't have to be cut out of this system if they act responsibly. For example, cities could start a data brokering exchange where commuters provide their commuting data (i.e., pick-up point, destination, arrival time). The government uses either a privatized fleet or a publicly owned fleet of autonomous vehicles to move as many people as possible as often as possible. Sort of a publicly run car-pool list - or a hyper-responsive bus fleet that runs for the exact passengers going to exact locations. A big problem companies like Uber, Lyft, and Tesla will have is that they'll lack market saturation to optimize commuting routes - they'll be able to win unique rides, but the best way they can achieve the lowest cost service model is these super predictable and timely commuter riders. The more data points and riders, the more optimization they can achieve. These companies can look at the data for as many people as possible and bid for as many routes as possible - optimizing for convenience, time, energy usage, emissions, etc. The public will voluntarily participate if this is optimized to get the cheapest ride possible. If the government doesn't do this, the private sector will eventually. 
 
As a parallel, no one today even considers how Metro runs garbage collection. No one cares. And if you didn't like Metro's trash service, if you needed a better service for unique needs, you go procure that on your own. Likewise, you wouldn't care about the quality of the commuting trip as long as it's up to some minimal standards of your class expectations, it's reliable, nearly as quick as driving your own vehicle, and it seems reasonably affordable. 
 
If the public ran this data exchange, fees could subsidize lower-income riders. This is a theory on what a TriMet like system or mass transit system could look like in a primarily autonomous world where most people don't own their own or drive an automobile. 
 
This system would be far from perfect, opening up all sorts of problems around mobility. However, it's hard to see how autonomous vehicles will not obliterate the value proposition of mass transit. 

##**Another narrative on the same story.**

As the working class moves to autonomous vehicles, transit agencies will collect fewer and fewer fares - prices and taxes will rise, creating a cycle of failure. As a result, some cities will make buses self-driving to cut costs. It could start with Tokyo, Shanghai, Oslo, et al. Again, it's unlikely that Portland or Oregon will be the first movers on this, but when cities start laying off hundreds of mass transit operators and cutting fares to practically nothing, there will be substantial public pressure to mimic locally. It will be *inhumane*, it will be *illiberal*, to make those impoverished bus-riding single mothers pay premiums. As most of the fleet becomes autonomous, responsive, and disconnected from labor costs, the next question arises: why do we still operate bus routes? Why big buses instead of smaller and nimble vehicles? 

This alternative story/perspective leads to the same outcome: we figure out where people are going and when they need to get there - then dispatch the appropriate amount of vehicles to move that exact number of people as efficiently as possible. 
 
But our local government getting its act together on all this is outside the world of possibility.

In a practical sense, we're going to see history repeat itself. Portland's mass transit history is about private and public entities over-extending themselves, getting too deep in debt on a flawed and outdated idea. As a result, the system collapses into consolidation or liquidation. Following this historical pattern, TriMet/Metro won't respond to changing conditions fast enough, and laughably stupid ideas like cranking up taxes or increasing ridership fares will continue to be the only option until the media finally acknowledges these groups are insolvent. I just hope we don't spend tens of billions of dollars propping up this zombie system before we can soberly realize that we made some mistakes and these vanity-laden projects 20 and 30 years ago need to die. 
 
You see, the biggest flaw with TriMet isn't the design, it needs to be outpaced by technology, it's that the people making decisions at TriMet and Metro are going to make the politically expedient decisions, not the right decisions. They won't redesign, and they won't leverage technology for cost savings, so this charade will just get going along until the media simply declares they're insolvent.

Back to fares for a second - the media happily reprints TriMet's horseshit take about ""[The higher fares will bring in an estimated $4.9 million in annual revenue starting next year, the report says.](https://www.opb.org/article/2023/05/24/trimet-fare-increase/)"" Just sort of amazing to me there's no skepticism about this number - but most spectacular is no media considerations about alternative solutions. For example, I could tell TriMet how to save [$9,548,091](https://trimet.org/about/pdf/trimetridership.pdf) next year - a useless program primarily utilized by white middle-class folks who own alternative methods of transport - and this would inconvenience way less transit-dependent people than raising fares. But, that's off the table - we're not even developing a decision matrix for when we kill the blackhole of money known as WES."

Up until I was finally able to get plugins working, ChatGPT has really been kind of a fancy toy. But the capacity to now find real literature references and summarize them is outstanding. This might be the kind of homework assignment I would give to a medical student or resident, and ordinarily it would take them about 2 hours. This result was under a minute, and the output is correct. The literature reference is correct. There is no hallucinatory content. It has honed in on exactly the right questions that should be asked of the paper and provided the actual answers. This is an outstanding force multiplier for medical education. Next I'll see how well it can do at functions like reviewing multiple sources or maybe even meta-analyzing pooled data sets, the kinds of tasks that take multiple authors anywhere from months to a couple years."
13xxdmc,51,2023-06-01,Edelgard Analysis month 1: Does Edelgard have PSTD?,u/[deleted],Edelgard,https://www.reddit.com/r/Edelgard/comments/13xxdmc/edelgard_analysis_month_1_does_edelgard_have_pstd/," 

Preface / My reason behind doing this for 22 day:

* 1st reason is because I want to challenge myself on analysing a game narrative as a game design student. 
* 2nd is that I want to improve people thought on both Edelgard as well as both of her routes as i feel like there is a lot of intentional misinformation out on her character as well her routes. ( I say Intentional since it was done by both the community, youtubers and TreeHouse. Which is sad because Edelgard and her routes, I feel has the best writing out of “Modern Fire Emblem” despite suffering from the flaws it received from the larger flaws within 3House and Hopes writing. ( Which is a larger topic that one day I might make a big post about. ) As on their own. These routes really don’t have many flaws and the flaws they do have can be forgiven I feel.
* I can’t write fic or draw for shit.

Notes: Originally, the first post was about Edelgard ideology and how it fitted into Humanism, but kept having brain farts. So I am skipping it for time being, I am using and continuing a analysis I wrote around 8 month more a go before losing interest. So there will be a few conflicting things here. And I guess change in writing. There will also be a lot of spelling and sentence mistakes because I am dyslexic as hell.

Now before I go into the nitty gritty of the post I will mention to 2 things. First is that I will probably come across as condescending as I will be talking about what is PTSD very thoroughly and explaining certain things like ‘Umbrella term’ in certain manner in the helps that it would better understand the subject matter for people.

The second thing’s is that I only have the basic understanding of PTSD and it subject manner because I only learn about PTSD and mental health issues when I was learning about the different counselling theory like behaviourism, psychodynamic and humanism therapy during my level 2 Youth Work course. It has been over 4 years since I was on that course and have I changed field of what I what to do with my life. 

Due to this, I will most certainly make mistakes here and I am not that well educated on the subject matter. Compared to let say the person who I get popularised the theory

**What is Trauma** 

In order to understand Post-traumatic stress disorder otherwise known as PTSD. We need to first understand what is “trauma”. 

Trauma is an emotional response that happen immediately after or later in life after a negative event that either happens unexpectedly or over the cause of a few or a multitude of days. This negative event can be many many things.

This 4 minutes long video by Nation Health Service ( NHS for short. ) Scotland explains trauma within a person childhood, how it effect adulthood and some additionally information’s on the subject matter. But while the video is focusing more on the children side of the subject. It doesn’t mean that these thing doesn’t effect adult with their lives. 

[Adverse Childhood Experiences - NHS Health Scotland - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMpIi-4CZK0&t=1s)

For those who don’t want to watch the video. Here’s a mind map I made. Yes I am putting that much effort into this post:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wwyzxi1gth3b1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a047c092a199b151c32245cd38482fdfdd1c041b

These are only the event that can cause Trauma that I can think of when writing this.

However, a key thing to understand about traumatic events is that people responds differently to the events that happens to them and that one traumatic event for one person might not be one for another.. Some are able to brush it off when it happens to them while other are unable to.

Using Dorothea and Ashe as an example here. They both suffer from being Homeless and was pick up by some sort of guardian figure. For Dorothea it was Manuela and the Opera company, while for Ashe, it was Lonato.

What separates them is that Ashe “overcame” his trauma and his mental health both due to his sibling, Lonato and Christoph being a loving adopted family and the environment that he was then surrounded in. Whilst with Dorothea, whilst Manuela was a loving guardian. She was brought into a environment that has a lot domestic violence, sexual abuse and much more which caused more mental health issues for Dorothea.

**Understanding Post Traumatic Stress Disorder**

PSTD within the UK is classified as an Anxiety and Psychiatric Disorder but in countries it is most likely classified differently but the main thing is that can be cause by the traumatic event’s I mention early.It could appear after the traumatic event happened or later down the lines after a couple of month to a year.

For explaining PSTD here, I will be using a lot of source since I probably won’t be able to explain it properly and make sure people have a good understanding of it which is the main I want to do.

To use a quote from PTSD UK which is charity: [PTSD Explained – PTSD UK](https://www.ptsduk.org/what-is-ptsd/ptsd-explained/)

>*“It’s estimated that 50% of people will experience a trauma at some point in their life. The defining characteristic of a traumatic event is its capacity to provoke fear, helplessness, or horror in response to the threat of injury or death and therefore can affect anyone.

(you can read more about the causes of PTSD here)*

>*The majority of people exposed to traumatic events experience some short-term distress, but eventually, their trauma fades to a memory – painful, but not destructive. However, around 20% of people who experience a trauma go on to develop Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).

This short video below goes into what is PTSD. ( It explains it better then what I ever could.):

[The psychology of post-traumatic stress disorder - Joelle Rabow Maletis - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_n9qegR7C4)

The main 2 thing I want to mention from this video is:

The first is what separate people from having PTSD to not having it is when the symptoms of what the source I mention earlier are consistent, where these flashbacks and nightmare keep happening after a month from traumatic incident or when you start having these symptoms suddenly one day after 5 month from the Traumatic event and where the symptoms start to bleed into everyday life and have an effect similar to addiction and other mental health issues. 

And the thing is that you don’t have to show all the symptoms to have PTSD. It similar to every other mental health but also disability where you could show just a few of those symptoms but they are enough to prove that you may have it.

The second is about how things that relate to the original trauma can cause a person to re experience and relive the trauma.

**The difference between PTSD and C-PTSD**

The last thing I want to mention is that there are multiple version of PTSD, this is something that people who aren’t as knowledgeable on mental health as a whole. Both of these come under the parent category or rather umbrella term / category of ‘Disorders specifically associated with stress’. ( This is a recent change from the World Health Organisation’s.)

To simplify Umbrella terms, think of it as something similar to genres where within video games, you have your shooters genre and within that genre you have your first-person shooters, third-person shooters, arcade shooters and much more. That is what Umbrella terms is and is used a lot in the social working field as a whole. 

And while doing my research I have found about ‘normal stress response, comorbid PTSD, acute stress disorder and uncomplicated PTSD’ which fit under this umbrella category. I will only be talking about the two in the title.

The main difference between Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and Complex-Post Traumatic Stress Disorder is the duration of the traumatic event.

To quote a video by “Psycho2Go” which goes into detail about C-PTSD:[C-PTSD...What is it? - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt0BsscVqJY)

>“PTSD is typically triggered by a specific or a series of events in a short period of time. While C-PTSD is caused by a series of traumatic events over a long period of time.” 

In other word’s, PTSD is caused by a singular traumatic event like car accidents or being raped whilst C-PTSD is caused by multiple, long-lasting, repeated or continuos traumas or traumatic events like domestic abuses, bullying and Repeated exposure to disaster, accidents, deaths or violent acts (including emergency service workers)

C-PTSD whilst share the same symptoms as one I mention above is much more severe then normal PTSD becomes of the continuos traumatic events which causes trust issues and if not treated can lead to all sorts of other issues like addictions, depression, anxiety and self-destructive behaviour to name a few and require much more professional help.

However, mental health issues as a whole is like a spectrum and ultimately symptoms and traumatic event are not binary. You can go through one single traumatic event and get C-PTSD while another person could through multiple and receive as bad PTSD or none at all. Traumatic event effect everyone differently and it also the fact that everyday life can effect this spectrum. Some day people with it are ok, other day it’t really bad.

To quote the same video again:

>“C-PTSD is an issue involving safety, for examples those who grew up in abusive household may lack a feeling of safety. This constant fear, a physical, emotional or psychological harm in childhood can cause problems later in life.” 

( This quote makes me want to want something about Dorothea trauma.)

In general trying to explain mental health condition as a whole is bloody hard to do.

Hopefully, I successfully explain what is PTSD that a lot of you understands it better thought honestly I think I probably made a good few mistakes here and there. Now let get onto explain about whether or not Edelgard has PTSD.

**Edelgard Traumatic Events**

Now ignoring the war aspect of the game since this Fire Emblem Game but also to borrow a quote from a another reddit user on a separate post where they were reply to another comment to give a reason why we are ignoring it. ( Not mentioning their usernames here because I don’t want them to get harassed. ) 

“I agree with all you said, especially the part ""we don't live in Fodlan and they don't live in our world. If tomorrow you get attack by a group of bandits, you will probably get scared for life"". Some scientific articles speak about that even in our modern world. The culture amd context of our country (people living in a country plunged by war are less at risk developing a ptsd from hearing/seeing a shooting than a dude living in the US/EU.). other factors include age (a little one doesn't have resources an adult has), duration, type of trauma (you can have some subtile differences, for example if the trauma is caused by someone you know or not, are you the author or victim of the abuse etc.), personality and past of someone (risk factors, how one manages stress) etc. Psychotraumatology is a new field and even today we haven't unbuncked precisely why one develops ptsd and the other no in reaction to a same event.”

Edelgard has quite a few traumatic event.

# Traumatic event 1: The Insurrection of the Seven 

Edelgard first traumatic event is in fact the Insurrection of Seven ( IoS for short. ), being separated from majority of her family and being forced to go into hiding with Faerghus.

We know that before the IoS, Edelgard has a good childhood with her being surrounded by her loving and caring family that is her siblings, Father, real Uncle and her retainer / best friend Hubert. 

From a Youth Worker PoV, I could mention about her not having two parents or two Guardians and the effects it can cause with all that stuff since Anselma was exiled from the Empire when Edelgard was a baby. But the real Arundel took up and became what is Edelgard second Parent / Guardian who was very caring and dotted on her which makes up for Edelgard not having 2 parents. ( And in reality, a lot of people nowaday has grown up with only one parent, so this point is utterly point less. )

It’s also implied in AM and details within both games as well as Jp version that Edelgard around this time was religious personas well, most likely getting this from the real Arundel as he was a deeply pious person. Note: It’s could implied that Hubert is also religious due to him carrying a Goddess Talisman around. 

However, Edelgard going into hiding was very sudden, in fact thanks to her support with Manuela that we know that Edelgard went to see a performance by Manuela with Her Uncle before leaving the Empire to go into hiding in Faerghus.

This would have caused a lot of stress for a child Edelgard, going from a loving family setting into a very unknown location, forced into hiding with no other point of contact other then her uncle would have been traumatic for Edelgard.

Even though she gain a new friend within Dimitri that unknown to him would have help her through it just by being friend. Since people underestimate how much being friends with someone can do for someone during struggling times. Over course of 1 to 3 years. 

I say 1-3 I remember the game not being consistent with this detail of how long they knew each other for which is partly on Treehouse mistranslation, CF for not really caring Edelgard and Dimitri previous which isn’t a negative as route and Edelgard character chooses to focus on the present and future while AM is AM. ( If this sound like I do not like AM, you are correct.) 

The event would have introduced a sense of fear when comes change and safety as she basically went into a big unknown. An unknown that is Faerghus. Which considering the lore, is bad. Like Faerghus would and should have a 0 out of ten on Trivago for a reason. Faerghus is inspired by the UK for a reason I know this as Brit.

# Traumatic event 2: The Return to the Empire, The New “Uncle Arundel” and the Experiment.

Joking / not joking aside  ( Like serious, Faerghus is bad. ) we known that this isn’t the last traumatic event as Edelgard sudden return to the Empire would have reintroduced this traumatic feeling into her. Especially, after she found a norm within the Kingdom even if it isn’t the same one as the her original norm within the Empire. This feel would have become worst with the sudden change in her “uncle”, going from a kind and loving person to a very blunt and cold person. ( Or rather Thalas body snatching Arundel )

This possible trauma did become a genuine thing if it hasn’t before as we know Edelgard has nightmare of the following event’s returning to the Empire, seeing her father powerless, seeing his eyes looking her in care. ( Care part was removed in Translation.) and seeing his clenched fists dripping with blood. Whilst details he betray from her Uncle is something we can definitely imply. 

This event becomes worst as she forced into the deepest part of Enbarr castle, it lowest dungeon, far from the light above for the experiment TWSITD, her new uncles and some of the Empire nobles. 

A subtle detail I just notice and another detail often missed is that there are multiple dungeons within Embarr. As within Edelgard support with Ferdinand in 3Hopes, she states that the dungeon of Ferdinand imagine of what the place his father would be like is a reality and is further down from where his father is staying. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gwxv5mokth3b1.png?width=701&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=fd569334e0e2db280fb7e3d453d63bc7c334810b

With Edelgard then saying before hand that she only been down there once, imply that other then her long placement down there during the experiment. She never return to the place of her sibling death. ( As Game Design Student and Media, I love camera shot above. ) 

While the detail that people missed mainly because it was removed in the English version was the implication that some of the Empire Nobles did know about the Experiments like Aegir and supposedly Varley but did nothing about. Note: Why would they as Ionius was trying to slowly strip their power with his reform. ( Yet again Treehouse removed the detail Ionius changing the Empire through reformation. It is one of the prime lore example of why change through diplomacy or reform won’t work. ) ( A nice detail also is that Edelgard choose not to put Ludwig Aegir in same dungeon, he put her and her siblings. Instead a better cells, something which Ferdinand appreciate Edelgard for doing. )

Getting back on topic, we know for a fact that the Experiment is a deeply traumatic event as we know that Edelgard struggles to get to sleep at night due to the nightmare and insomnia it cause her, seeing her sibling and father suffer. 

She also reliving the event both at Remire village, her 3 Hopes paralogue, Hyrm in SB and the return of TWSITD in 3 Hopes. It’s an event that plagues her mind at times and is something she tries to lie to Byleth to a degree due to the nature of it all. ( She lies about it being a plague to them, which isn’t a bad thing since if Edelgard was to tell them without fully trusting them, them blabbing about it would put both Byleth at risk but also Edelgard. )

The Experiment very much gave Edelgard a deeply traumatic experiment on it own to the point that it enough evidence to say she has got C-PTSD from this alone. But we not finished there as still got two more traumatic event.

# Traumatic event 3: Lost in Faith.

Now there was a reason behind me mention Edelgard being previous religiously, possibly to the degree of being a devout follow and that because Edelgard went through a lose of faith during the experiment. 

I think this quote from CaptainFlash just sums it better then what I ever could:[Edelgard and faith : fireemblem (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fireemblem/comments/ejdzo4/edelgard_and_faith/)

>*If you look at Edelgard's conversation with Dimitri in Azure Moon, a heartbreaking fact emerges-Edelgard was once a devout believer. She says to Dimitri- ""****Even if one clings to their faith, the goddess will never answer them. Countless souls will be lost that way. Living without purpose. And I can be counted among those who have died that way as well****."" The implication here is devastating- Edelgard was a formerly religious child, ""clinging to their faith"", pleading to the goddess to make her torture stop, and was instead left broken and ignored (of course, she had no way of knowing about Sothis' true situation). This makes sense given what we know about the greater social context of Fodlan-individuals who have a Crest often are presumed to have a special relationship with those who originated their Crests. This would be particularly true for a young girl bearing the Crest of Seiros, the first and most famous disciple of Sothis, particularly given the close historical ties between Seiros and the Adrestian Emperors. However, young Edelgard's petitions to the gods remained unanswered-her siblings died horrifically in front of her eyes, and she herself was tortured both psychologically and physically for years. Edelgard's entire worldview was shattered.*  
>  
>*I want to make a brief aside here, to state that, as you can probably guess from some of my other posts, I empathize greatly with Edelgard and her worldview. There is nothing-not her death scenes, not turning into a monster in Azure Moon, not confirming her fatalistic world view by rejecting her in the tomb, which is more painful and true to life to me than those lines she says to Dimitri. There's a term with C-PTSD called ""loss of systems of meaning"" where the individual experiences a disconnect with their pre-trauma self and are unable to rely on things that previously defined his or her identity-that's what happened to Edelgard. It's why she says things like ""the Edelgard who cries died years ago.""*  
>  
>*One of the major teachings of the Church of Seiros is that the goddess ""****cares for and protects all that is beautiful in this world****"" (You can find this listed among the major commandments of the faith in the library). One can certainly see the devastating impact this had on Marianne (who speaks of Edelgard in reverent tones in CF), but it also had a deep impact on Edelgard and how she views herself. Since Edelgard wasn't cared for and protected, she must not be ""beautiful."" If you want an idea of how Edelgard views herself internally, one need only look at Hegemon Edelgard in Azure Moon, a (symbolic) physical manifestation of Edelgard's dehumanization and utter self-loathing. This sense of abandonment, broken faith, and the persistent belief that she unable to be loved drives everything that Edelgard does. Due to this internalized sense of abandonment, Edelgard lacks self-worth as a human being-it's why she continues to question Byleth following her even in Crimson Flower, and why she says she ""never thought"" anyone would follow her.*

I think what makes this situation worst is both the crest Edelgard received and the situation she is in. In that during the experiment, seeing her siblings slowly going insane before dying whilst her prays goes ignored. Being surrounded by Rat and never seeing the light again.

Until one day, she find a different crest that appears that isn’t Crest of Seiros. A built up Crest of Flame, that Nemesis, a corrupted Hero, a figure within the religious that hailed him as a Villain for being delighted in bloodshed, now appears. This would have shattered her belief since it would possible proof that the Goddess might not be real and that Crest aren’t gift at all.

 This whole break in faith becomes worst when you consider the Emperor, knowledge or rather text pass down through Emperor stating the truth about the war. That Nemesis wasn’t this figure of villainy the Church built up was just bandit. That the war between the Empire and Church / Nabataen vs Nemesis King of Liberation / Northern Fodlan and TWSITD ( a faction removed from history. ) wasn’t a holy war but instead dispute, a war over who would be in power. Before learning about the existence of Nabataen’s. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xpq5rkzeuh3b1.png?width=359&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ca06fabaa76b09b66779fbe300dfe7e7f078239c

Here the teaspoon translation of the dialogue. 

Edelgard faith in the Goddess and in the Church as it stands is something that basically got repeatedly stamp and made her look like a fool. As she learn 70-80% of the Truth about the war of Heroes. 

The only part she is missing is the original spat war between TWSITD and Nabatean and how side has suffered such as the genocide on both races but which point does it stop mattering, ( Genocide is bad and there nothing excusing it but it clear within the narrative that both Argarthan or Nabataen are as bad as each other. )

The continue war and manipulation between two faction has gone on for over 1000 years to Edelgard with both side showing they are more then content willing to use those around them. Rhea and Seteth willing to censor information and abuse their position and the Church monopoly in order to keep their ivory tower and to keep their version of “peace.” ( As CF, WC, SB and the introduction of 3 Hopes shows. )

Whilst TWSITD are TWSITD, it clear the spat battle will continue until either sides are completely gone. Just like the Edelgard debates ffs.

But getting back on topic, the shattering of Edelgard faith would have caused a both trauma for her as well as a changes in ideology when it comes to the faith. In that her views has becomes negative. 

I am just going to post a good chunk of her support with Manuela from Teaspoon Translation but I want people to remember something and that is at times. Edelgard speaks about subtle about speaking herself as well as her previous self. In most cases, she is quite negative. 

&#x200B;

Edelgard belief in the current Church of Seiros is negative, seeing the corruption within it and understanding that the only way to fix the issues is to start again. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3kde4ehtuh3b1.png?width=481&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c9bd3a26a4653008d42e8b32484b020d32f27b3c

 

Something that she sorta does in 3 Hopes to an extent by reforming the Southern Church. (Varley is only in the position he is in is because Edelgard and Hubert needed to find a way to keep him busy and to use him as a Assassination pawn for the Church to try and kill as in 3 House, he under house arrest imply which implies a lot of things. All of them negative )

Edelgard faith in the goddess is gone. Now onto the last traumatic.

# Traumatic event 4: TWSITD continual existence.

This one is the most easier to explain as they are Edelgard abuser, their return in SB causes Edelgard trauma to return and for her to relive the events. Something that is really understated by I feel the community is how well written SB is and how good Edelgard support Bernadetta is as it delivers into the both character trauma. 

Edelgard partly see the trauma, the nightmares and fears she received from TWSITD and their experiment as a curse, believing that because she beat TWSITD and that they are gone for a while, that her curse has been lifted, the same way Bernadetta trauma / curse has been lifted due to Varley situation at the Monastery, fearing assassination attempt, Bernie being away from him as well as surrounding herself with her friends.

Until the ticking bomb within SB narrative explodes and TWSITD causing Edelgard trauma / curse to resurface. Something that Edelgard tries to hide from her friends around her, only for Bernadetta to see through Edelgard, seeing the trauma / curse eat away at her, relating to Edelgard and her issues. Understanding the negative emotion Edelgard is feeling, the Hyperarousal we talked about earlier you may say.

>***Hyperarousal (feeling ""on edge"")***  
>  
>*Someone with PTSD may be very anxious and find it difficult to relax. They may be constantly aware of threats and easily startled.* 

This is one of Fire Emblem best support and this is totally not my next post. 

But yeah, because of th situation Edelgard find herself in. Her trauma continues.

# Does Edelgard have PTSD? 

Short answer, yes she does in fact C-PTSD. She suffers from a lot of the symptoms.

Long Answer, still yes. Edelgard as through both games, it clears she suffers from a lot of the symptoms like:

* **Re-experiencing**
   * Nightmares
   * Flashbacks
   * physical sensations, such as pain, sweating, feeling sick or trembling
* ***Avoidance and emotional numbing***
   * A key part of Edelgard relationship with Bernadetta and especially Byleth is the idea of numbing one feels. Edelgard in WC actively tries to numb her feeling in attempt to not become overly emotion. One of her dislike is losing control of Emotion.( Treehouse got rid of the Emotion parts. ) As well as distancing herself from other due to said trauma and because of Hubert fearing for her safety because own trauma
* Her whole B support with Byleth is about Edelgard losing her emotion, losing the human part of herself. That is point behind Heart of Ice line, the JP version implied this but it was sorta lost in translation because Treehouse but also by the community. It why when understand the themes of the route that her scene of painting Byleth, a friend of her becomes much more impactful as she is allowing herself to do an activities that isn’t work related as is a hobby. ( 3hopes makes it clear Edelgard doesn’t relax or takes break enough. )
* ***Hyperarousal (feeling ""on edge"")***
   * *irritability*
   * *angry outbursts*
   * *sleeping problems (insomnia)*
* ***Other problems***
   * Phobias like with Rat but most notably her thalassophobia, which fear of bodies of water. Which is mostly likely caused by her Trauma, Ironically at the hands of Thalas. 
   * Destructive behaviour. ( Hegemon, her lack of self-worth, etc. )
   * PTSD sometimes leads to work-related problems and the breakdown of relationships.
* Edelgard also suffers from memory lost because of the traumatic

It clear Edelgard suffer from a lot of symptoms and it best to say that her trauma is C-PTSD because it very much was continues. She went from traumatic event to another, whilst we never fully got her feeling on the stay at the Kingdom since we can’t really use Dimitri as he is unreliable narrator because of his own trauma caused by both Faerghus system and the assassination attempt. It clear Edelgard feeling on the stay was mixed but it had one good thing in it being her time with Dimitri. 

But otherwise, Edelgard went from one traumatic event that basically beat her down, ripping apart both the people she loved and what she believed. The darkness kept getting darker for her until she was the only one left.

#  Conclusion 

For the conclusion I want to talk about two things. First is how I guess how much more grounded her portray of PTSD is and I guess how inspiring it. But also I guess the issues people have with neither game focussed on Edelgard past.

Ok first thing first, Edelgard portray is probably one of more ground of PTSD. It not hypermedialised ( I not sure if that the right terminology.) like Dimitri PTSD where it very much a toxic and bad portrayal of it similar to guess the Good Doctor and most other shows that has a Autistic character in my opinion.( Very much a problem that with Dimitri and AM writing. ) There a lot more people who suffer from issues or I disabilities that hide it that you wouldn’t know until getting to know the person. 

Edelgard C-PTSD is very much more subtle and less in your face even after you know about Edelgard issues as it put within her dialogue in a smart way. before you get to her C- support, you would never guess this girl who poses like this whilst wearing bright red tights: 

&#x200B;

*Processing img k8spqqwavh3b1...*

 

Would be suffering from trauma, no, you think she a prideful upper class nobles due to her clothing, Possibly to an egotistical degree. But the design and her writing work because it tears down all perceived idea you have on her character trauma. Edelgard mask and hide her trauma like most other people do. She cares about people not because it her job but because she actually gives shit about people and their lives and wants the best for them.

And Edelgard view on her trauma which I will expanded on my next post is sorta inspiring because her thoughts ultimately goes. “My family are dead and I was experiment as well as countless others who were made victim by Fodlan issues. That is in the past, people are still suffering today and I refuse to allow more people to become victim and I am going to fight for both here and in the future so then they can makes a word based on their own agency, free from parties that made people in victim.”

It inspiring because it a refusal to allow oneself to lose themselves in issues they are having. To continue fighting for a brighter future. Something that is actually constant theme and motif within Fire Emblem series and its a theme that CF and SB holds the most relevance to out of the routes in both games. And I feel like it hits most well here compared to previous FE games because of how much more personal and grounded the game tries to be. 

Secondly, I don’t think it a issues that neither CF or SB touches on Edelgard past either with showcasing her sibling and her relationship or seeing Ionius and Anselma true love for each other. ( Since it implied Anselma didn’t love Lambert and all that inconsistent stuff with AM, Hapi support and AG does with Anselma. ) 

Does it suck that we don’t get scene of Edelgard and her past. Yes, I do want to know more about her sibling and of the empire and it politics. But that a sign of a well written character, lore and story. The feeling of wanting more from it. CF and SB are very much stories that understand it what it going and cuts out all the extra fat that Fire Emblem normally has that ultimately takes away from the story.

Both stories are about Edelgard, her war and focusing on the issues her and now and trying to improve things for the future. Going against opponents that either refuse to change or hold net negative belief or holds differ belief. Her going back onto the past while interesting, would hinder the tight pacing in both those routes when it comes to the media of video games. ( Focusing on the past is Dimitri things,even if it done badly in my opinion. )

Now if let say 3 House and Hopes get a anime, light novel or manga adaptation, then you can proper pacing the story much more because it being a passive form of media. As well as chose when you want to explore Edelgard and her past, making her the central character for let say the Episode, book chapter.

Something that you could also do with other character like let say Claude and going into his childhood and his toxic relationship with his sibling. Or Dorothea and her trying to survive on the street. Or Valery abuse of Bernadetta. You can better explore this character and who they are in these media better then in video games.

Crimson Flower and Scarlett Blaze in my opinion are the only routes that I feel would only be a net positive and wouldn’t have negative that would appear within their narrative unlike other routers. But I’m going to stop here as I basically shat on other routes and Dimitri for this segment.

I hope people had a nice read and I hope everyone has a nice day.

Currently my task is to research and prototype an AI learning assistant which walks students individually through a curriculum module for learning HTML. 

Are there any go-to models or service providers around yet?  
I see there are many OSS LLMs like llama and such, and there are hosted model services such as MosaicML. 

A constraint I have is that the model should be self-hostable, or hosted by GDPR-compliant service providers.

In terms of inference capabilities: english language question answering, code generation, conversation are required.

In terms of training: yes please!

Larger context capacities / vectorDBs would be ""nice to have"", would be great for the model to be able to keep track and have some intuition about the student's progress.  


What would you do? Which models/services would you try? Which DBs?  


Thanks for your insights!  


(btw, i'm a senior dev with some ML experience (have played with gpt2 and openAI's APIs), am fine with solutions that require a lot of coding, debugging if necessary.)"

***Memory transcription subject: Professor Haeli, Galactic Music Professor at White Hill University***

*Date \[standardized human time\]: September 7, 2136*

I've always taken my work seriously. Music might not be as directly applicable as engineering or business but it does have influence over the public. Even as an entry-level professor, I put forth great effort in my work. Even if it was for my own desire for integrity.

Still, Blyne’s expectations were surprising.

It's not that I felt incapable. Rather, no one had ever approached me with something so…delicate. This was a new development, something that had been lacking in my field for as long as I could remember.

So, naturally, I found myself completely and utterly stumped.

I was glad to see such importance placed on my position. I was often used to music being overlooked. For as much as the Federation touted the cultural advantage of prey species over the dreaded Arxur, songs didn’t defend the planet from raids. Guns did. I recognized that reality but often felt as though musical education was overly neglected. Despite the promise of newfound attention, being in such an unfamiliar situation had my nerves frazzled.

I was hoping Grace, being a professional Human musician, could offer me some insight on what I should do.

“The headmaster wants me to prove that Humans and Venlil have a place in one anothers’ societies. I can’t figure out how I’m supposed to prove that. I teach music, not socioeconomics.”

“I think he’s just looking for something practical, love. Maybe I could do a little virtual performance for him over video; show him that Humans are perfectly capable of cultural intelligence, and that we can be cordial in a performance setting.”

I still wasn’t used to her calling me ‘love’ like that. Apparently it was a dialect thing.

“That might help my case if it’s not too much trouble. He seems genuinely interested in what Humans are capable of.”

*Could I even get Blyne to watch something like that though? He said he supports my efforts but still…*

“Which reminds me, we still haven’t done a video call yet.”

I had tried so desperately to avoid the topic but she was always steering our conversation toward that fact. She was within her rights to desire such a thing. That was, after all, the point of the program.

“Grace, I know it’s only a matter of time. I just…It’s scary.”

“I assure you I don’t pose any threat. Look, if you’re going to get through all of this, you’ll need to make peace with our faces. Your student has already managed it. As his teacher, you shouldn’t let him overtake you so easily, in my honest opinion. You should be able to surpass him.”

“Sounds like an awfully competitive approach. Are all Humans that way?”

“You call that competitive? I’d call it a simple expectation. You’re supposed to be the one paving the way. That’s why you came up with this project, yeah?”

I sighed. She was right. It was my cowardice that was barring me from progressing. I’d decided to start this study and now I was being passed up by my own students.

“Alright. You win. Just…could you turn to the side at first. I don’t want to be met with predator eyes immediately.”

“Of course. I’ll turn the camera off if it goes to shite. But, I think you’ll find I’m less monstrous than you might imagine.”

I’d seen reference images. In some way, they were rather flimsy looking. Despite the piercing binocular eyes, they didn’t have the long claws or powerful builds of the Arxur. Still, even the still reference photos had sent a shiver down my spine.

*This is Grace, though. You know her. It’s not some unnamed Human model.*

I pulled the exchange app up to the computer screen, bracing myself for the Human visage.

“I’m ready.”

“Very well. I’m putting it on.”

The screen changed to reveal a Human side profile. Instantly, my heart rate shot up and I gripped the sides of my chair.

“Haeli, love? Are you alright? I actually can’t tell since I’m looking the other way.”

“I-I’m fine. I j-just need to a-adjust.”

“Take your time. It’s alright.”

Grace had switched from her regular voice to the sing-song voice she had used when I’d first spoken to her. The melodious tone helped to put me at ease.

I took deep, slow breaths to steady myself. My muscles began to relax and the shaking receded. I looked down to find that my claws had torn through the fabric on the armrests of my seat involuntarily.

*I didn’t know my claws could even cut that well.*

The realization gave me enough of a distraction to steady myself completely. I focused on the screen and took the image in. Grace’s one visible pupil and skin were different shades of brown. She wore a gray artificial pelt that ran over her shoulders and down out of the frame. Her hair, a deep black, sat tied back and drooping down behind her head. Her nose jutted outward to about the average length I’d seen in the references. Just as well, her mouth was fairly small, not lending itself to the idea of a jagged-toothed predator.

Her eyes remained fixed off to the side, trying not to look at me.

*Welp. Here comes the hard part.*

“I’m calm, I think. Please, turn to face me. I know that’s how Humans usually communicate.”

“Alright, I’ll turn my eyes first by themselves slowly. Then I’ll turn my whole chair.”

I flicked my ears in acknowledgement though she was no doubt unable to see it. In fact, she was probably unfamiliar with the motion in the first place.

*How unfortunate to not be able to communicate in such ways. I wonder how Humans read each others’ body language?*

As I considered such a thing, her one visible eye slowly swept towards the camera. After a moment, it was trained on me. I flinched slightly at the realization but stayed firm, continuing my deep breathing.

“I’m turning the chair now.”

Slowly, her whole body turned to face me, her eyes, now both visible, remained trained on the camera as though they were locked in their orientation. I shuddered at the sheer accuracy of her vision, letting out a slight whimper by accident.“Too much?”

“N-no. I-I’ll get through th-this. I h-have to.”

Grace slowly nodded her head in a motion I didn’t recognize. Submission? Concern?

*Wait…I think I read that it was acknowledgement. Maybe I should do that in place of ear flicks. It’d be something we can both do and read easily. That is, if I can get through this without having a fucking heart attack.*

Grace’s face was fully facing the camera. Part of me expected something terrible to happen, like my subconscious was warning me of impending doom even as my logical mind knew that it was just a video call. I held my eye up to her predatory stare, gripped by terror but unmoving regardless.

Of course, nothing actually happened. As I sat there in my office, far from any threat, I began to slowly let myself go slack. The tension I’d been experiencing left my body in increments. I took the time to study her more closely as curiosity got the better of me.

As I’d expected, the eyes were really the only threatening thing about her. Granted, her mouth was closed so I didn’t get a look at her teeth. From what I had heard, the Human canines were rather small and they also had teeth for crushing plant matter similar to our own.

“Are you…s-seriously an apex predator?”

The words had left my mouth before I had a chance to consider them. Even in my fearful state, I managed to question a predator’s ability to hunt. Was I out of my mind? Would that make her angry?

Her hand shot up to cover her mouth as she giggled in response. She was laughing at me?

“Oh, trust me, love. We didn’t become apex predators with our natural armaments. We were just smart enough to use strategy. That, and we can put just about anything on a hell of a flight path. Humans are rather well-versed when it comes to throwing.

*Throwing things? There’s no way that’s all it takes.*

“H-how does throwing things m-make you a good predator?”

“Prey animals on Earth can be dangerous up close. I know that’s a foreign concept for the Venlil but such wildlife can be difficult to hunt for that reason. Can’t get close? Fashion a spear and strike from afar. Simple as that.”

*Dangerous prey? Humans must not be that naturally threatening if they consider prey dangerous.*

As she gave me her explanation, I found myself beginning to fully relax. Despite the fact that she was talking about hunting, it was still *her* voice, one I’ve become familiar with over the last few paws. That recognition became my anchor, allowing me to make peace with her visage. It helped that she lacked the massive fangs and claws of an Arxur. It would take some time to adjust but I could accept the forward-facing eyes. That wasn’t enough to make a Human dangerous by itself.

I slowly raised my ears from the top of my head and tried to sit with the confidence befitting a professor.

“I a-apologize. I’m usually n-not such a mess.”

“I’ve heard plenty of disastrous stories about partner introductions. Comparatively, I think you’re doing quite well.”

“Th-thank you.”

I was doing it. I was speaking with a predator. This is what I’d expected of myself at the beginning but I still felt surprised. My desire to converse with Humans had come from my passion, my drive to make a difference and learn new things. My aversion had come from my experience, having only known predators as evil monsters for all my life. The two lines of reasoning were clashing in my mind. But, I could feel the optimism winning out. I could do this.

“So,” Grace continued. “How about we drum up a catalog I can play for the headmaster? I’m sure between the two of us, we can make something appealing.”

“R-right. That’s a good idea.”

*Can I really get Blyne to listen to her? I guess I have no reason not to try. He's been supportive thus far.*

Part of me wished the doubters had been right; that Humans would have no musical complexity. Now I’m faced with a daunting challenge. I could only hope that I had the capabilities to succeed, not just for my own sake, but for our chances of working with Humans in the future.

***Memory transcription subject: Kila, Venlil Engineering Student (First Year) White Hill University***

*Date \[standardized human time\]: September 7, 2136*

If the simulations were trustworthy, the slender metal tubing I’d left laying in my dorm room should work well enough.

*Theoretically, of course.*

Unfortunately, I was still missing the most important part. The vibration mechanism was continuing to act as my biggest roadblock. I’d been engrossed with the project against my better judgment since my call with Brad. I would probably benefit from a break but the frustration of not being able to figure it out had taken me hostage. Even in the midst of lectures, I was playing with the simulation rather than taking notes.

“Kila, the lesson ended some time ago. Are you stumped by something?”

The words of Professor Gretty snapped me out of my focus. Despite my wide field of vision, I’d still somehow managed to ignore the entire lecture hall being vacated. I felt my face turn orange with embarrassment.

“No, sir. Actually, I was working on my own project. Sorry, I might have not been paying as much attention as I should have been.”

He flicked his tail in a motion of indifference.

“You’re one of the more capable students in this class. Not many students attend office hours for the first five sessions.”

It was no exaggeration. As the term had begun, I’d confided in Professor Gretty for an early engineering project. It had been my goal to overachieve initially to give myself a buffer in case I struggled later on. All in all, I was glad for those efforts now that I was most definitely slacking in regards to my school work.

“I’m glad you think highly of me sir. You’re a capable teacher in your own right.”

“I appreciate the compliment but I must say I’m curious. What exactly are you working on that has your attention so captivated that you don’t notice that you’re in a room devoid of people?”

“I’m trying to figure out how to redesign a h-”

*Probably shouldn't bring up the specifics. It's a touchy subject.*

“-an instrument for Venlil use. It typically uses a method of playing that we can’t naturally replicate. Basically, I need to cause buzzing at this point to vibrate the air column in the instrument.”

I motioned to the point on the model. The mechanism needed to be small, able to fit into the end of the tubing. I’d been hashing out ideas for far longer than I would have liked.

“The main trick,” I continued. “Has to do with the changing frequency. See, it has to change along with the slide as it moves in and out. Also, it has to be able to change harmonics depending on each position. The player needs to push air through the system to maintain the internal state. So, I need a way to create the vibrations independent of that while still allowing air to pass through. As of right now, I'm just trying to work through the math and figure out what frequencies I need at what lengths to get everything resonating properly.”

Gretty studied the design closely, taking stock of the model thus far.

“Odd. I’ve never seen an instrument like this before. Why rework an instrument anyway? You're not a music student. Is it a personal project?”

Glad that he didn’t pry anymore into the origins of the device, I answered before he could decide to.

“Yes, it’s a personal project. A friend of mine actually is a music student. I thought he might enjoy using an exotic instrument but it’s proving difficult to accommodate for our anatomy.”

“I’m not much of an engineer but I could maybe help you figure out the frequencies required to create the right resonance. Send me the dimensions and I’ll see what I can do.”

“Oh, it’s not that big of a deal, professor. You don’t need to worry about it.”

“Nonsense. I’m happy to see my students applying what they learn even for personal projects. After all, what good would an education be without practical use? Send me the dimensions. I insist.”

I flicked my ears in affirmation.

“Thank you, professor! I’ll get those to you right away.”

“Remember, Kila,” he leaned in for emphasis. “If you run into any issues you think I can help with, I’ll lend you a paw. Just make sure to do your best.”

Flicking my ears one more time, I picked up my belongings and made my way for the exit.

*Maybe I should have been less secretive with him. No. I can’t risk it. Human integration is a controversial topic right now. It’s good to know he’s willing to help, though. Having the numbers mapped out would make it way easier to design the mechanism.*

I could probably emulate the vibrations easily enough. It’d take some tricky robotics to get the different frequency options working. The real question was how to handle the controls. A Venlil player wouldn’t just be able to move the muscles in their mouths the same way a Human can. I’ll need to find a way to get it to respond to the movement in the slide automatically. Then, maybe I could place buttons on the slide itself to change the harmonic up or down. It'd probably have to be a short-range wireless setup. I'd need to make sure there isn't a noticeable delay too.

*It’s going to take some finnicking with electronics. I hope I remember how to design compact circuits. Plus there's the code to write. Should be simple enough.*

All of this for something a Human can do with their lips. I was really running against the wind for this.

***Memory transcription subject: Professor Haeli, Galactic Music Professor at White Hill University***

*Date \[standardized human time\]: September 8, 2136*

Entering Blyne’s office, the plateau of paperwork seemed to have only gotten taller. He peaked up over the impending workload, eyes even more tired than before.

“Hello, Professor Haeli. I hope the paw has treated you better than it’s treated me so far.”

I took a seat across from him, just barely able to make him out over the wall of documents.

“Judging by the new height of your desk, I’d say it probably has, headmaster.”

He chuckled at the comment, though the fatigue crept through his features.

“I’m still determined to make time for you. After all, most of this paperwork is awaiting your conclusions anyway.”

I swished my tail in understanding but he may not have noticed given the stacks were impeding his vision.

“Honestly, headmaster, I’m somewhat surprised that you agreed to this. It took me several paws to work up the courage to enter a video call with my partner. Are you sure that this is a good idea?”

“I trusted you to be head over Human studies for the time being. And, I told you that I’d support you where I could. Hundreds of Venlil have entered visual contact with humans. If the integration continues as it has, that number will only grow. I’ll handle it. I trust your judgment. Also, I think I'm too damn tired to bolt from my desk at the sight of your partner.”

Flicking my ears in acknowledgement, I turned my attention to my pad. Navigating the app, I initiated a video call with Grace. Hopefully, she hadn’t forgotten about the time we’d decided on.

I was satisfied to see that she had remembered as her side profile appeared on the screen. I flinched slightly but stayed composed. This time, the camera seemed further away, able to capture the image of both her and her piano. The device was one of the more recognizable Human instruments. According to Grace, it was standard for songwriters to have one. Easy to learn but incredibly difficult to master.

“All set here, love,” she spoke without turning to face me. Instead, her binocular eyes were trained on the pages in front of her.

“Headmaster Blyne, are you ready?” I questioned, giving him one last chance to back out.

“Turn the pad to me, Professor Haeli. I’m prepared.”

I slowly spun the pad around to face Blyne, propping it up against a tower of paper. He tensed up and inhaled sharply at the sight. However, after a moment, he began to relax his muscles.

“G-greetings. My name is B-Blyne. I'm the headmaster at W-White Hill University. To whom d-do I owe the pleasure?”

“My name is Grace Patel. But, I know the Venlil typically only use one name. You may refer to me as just Grace. I'm a professional musician that specializes in this: the piano.”

“W-what a peculiar device,” he observed. “Quite large for a musical instrument, no?”

Despite the initial quiver in his voice, by the time he reached the end of his thought, it already carried the same confidence that was typically present.

*He got over it that fast? I guess I should expect nothing else from the headmaster. He’s used to dealing with stress.*

“Yes, sir,” came Grace’s response. Though, she continued to face the pages. “A grand piano is among the largest despite its commonality. It owes its size to the fact that it’s technically somewhat of a string instrument. Each key moves a small hammer that strikes long, taught strings inside.”

“Fascinating. Could you show me what it sounds like before moving into a full piece?”

“Of course.”

Grace’s hands flew lightly across the keys, rolling up and down scales with ease. I couldn’t imagine Venlil paws being so dexterous. She made it look effortless.

*She’s a professional alright.*

Grace also tapped the keys with different amounts of force, putting the breadth of dynamics on display. Then, she played some chords. At first, they were small and simple but they quickly grew to massive complex variants.

Initially, the fact that they used only half the tones we placed between sets made me believe that their harmonic practice would be lacking. It seemed that was rather short-sighted.

Blyne appeared to be rather entranced by the sound.

“What immense range. You said this was called a grand piano?”

“Yes, sir. There are many variations on the piano but this is the most common for symphony orchestras and solo pieces.”

Blyne flicked his ears in acknowledgement.

“I must say I'm rather impressed thus far. It may come as a surprise but I used to play a couple instruments myself in my younger years. I can tell that you're very technically proficient even by that little demo alone.”

“I like to think that I am. After all, I do this for a living.”

“How fortunate that Human society accommodates for that,” I interjected. “I think most Venlil would expect there to be no room for such a thing in a predatory society.”

Grace squinted her eyes but they remained trained forward.

“It's not exactly an easy occupation, I’m afraid,” she responded. “It's a lot of hours and not always great pay. In the end, it usually gets sidelined for jobs that are considered more practical.”

“It's a similar story within the Federation too. After all, music doesn't grow crops or fight Arxur.”

Blyne seemed to look sympathetic to my plight. He no doubt felt guilty of such standards. Time and time again, the budget had found its way to other departments. Not that I blamed him. There was always pressure from donors and the government. I new technological advancement would always take priority over musical capabilities. That was the truth. And, in all honesty, I couldn't bring myself to disagree completely with the principle.

“Music has its applications,” Grace continued. “It can bridge cultural differences or improve morale in dark times. For Humans, it can also be used to bring awareness to social issues. I'm not sure if that's standard practice for you, though.”

*Using music as a form of protest? I can’t say that I’ve ever heard of such a thing.*

“I understand that Humans have a rich musical history,” Blyne spoke. “I'm intrigued to know what you've selected for us today, Miss Grace.”

“I'm very excited to play for the both of you. I don't believe Haeli has heard this first song yet, either.”

We’d already selected a few pieces some time before. I'd heard each and every one. Yet, she was going beyond our list? I hoped that she knew what she was doing.

“This piece,” she continued. “Was written by Claude Debussy a little over two hundred years ago during the standard Human year of 1905. It was made exclusively for piano. Today, it’s regarded as a classic.”

Grace sat up in her seat and hovered her hands over the keys.

""The title of this piece is [***Moonlight***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGJPVl7iQUM&ab_channel=JohannDebussy-Topic).""

She scooted herself ever so slightly closer to the behemoth of an instrument and entered a state of visible focus.

Then, gently, she pressed down on the keys.

The sound was nearly inaudible. Grace’s dexterous hands tapped gently along the instrument, leaving ample space between the groupings of tones. It didn't seem like she was abiding by any particular rhythmic structure. It was loose but not in a chaotic sense. The tune drifted lazily from each point to the next like petals in a breeze. Harmonically, it felt melancholy; not bright and cheerful but not necessarily dark either.

This changed for a brief moment where the chords became somber. However, the higher tones returned with a kind of arcing motion to counterbalance it. Grace’s timing lent itself to a rising and falling motion to match the tonal development.

Soon, those arcs turned into cascades, starting slowly and gradually increasing in tempo. I almost didn't notice the volume increasing alongside it. The chords began to feel more foreboding. I could feel my heart rate rising as Grace vaulted into increasingly dark tonal motion.

Then, suddenly, she played a bright pattern in an upwards motion, much more lightly than the cascades before. The motion was repeated a few times, each one lower in volume.

After a moment of blissful serenity, Grace’s playing took on a quality that I could only describe as wonderment. Once again, the piece became dynamically louder. The rate of tones increased but didn't carry the darkness from before. Instead, the harmonies were bright and easy on the ears.

The speed at which she played was impressive, though unconventional. Nothing she'd played for me had reached that pace. I wondered if Blyne could handle the sudden jump in tempo. But, when I stole a glance at him, he seemed just as entranced as I was.

For a moment, the tiredness in his eyes seemed replaced with wonder.

The music seemed to falter, not in the executive sense but rather there was a feeling of specifically designed instability. It was as though the piece was portraying a loss of balance, just barely leaning over a sharp edge.

But, just as it seemed about to fall, the volume once more dropped to near silence as it returned to its melancholy origin. It seemed to be nearly identical to the opening. And, after drifting between patterns for a moment, each reminiscent of a broader section of the work, it ended as meekly as it began. I was briefly unsure that it was actually over. It was like it just slipped right out of the room. I only had my confirmation when Grace slid away from the piano.

Blyne and I sat in silence momentarily, soaking in the experience.

“It's been many years since I've heard something so immersive,” Blyne’s voice took on the sound of nostalgia. “Truly, that was encapsulating.”

I flicked my ears in acknowledgement.

“I'm not sure I fully understood the symbolism though. It's likely a planetary difference. How do Humans interpret the moon?”

Grace tilted her head to the side in a look I assumed was confusion until realization hit her.

“Ah, I almost forgot that's what it translates to. See, the title is in a different language than the one I speak. I speak primarily English but the title is French. Your translators seem not to discriminate. If you wouldn't mind, turn them off for just a moment and I'll say the title verbatim.”

Blyne and I both complied with the request, powering them off and flicking our ears in a ‘go ahead’ motion. After the motion was lost on her briefly, Grace realized we were ready and spoke the title once more.

“***Claire de Lune***.”

It sounded starkly different to the Venlil sound that it had been translated to. Though, it sounded almost melodious in nature.

After we turned the translators back on, Grace continued her thought.

“To answer your question, Haeli, the moon can mean a number of different things depending on culture. But, one thing that is constant is its association with the night. I'd say in this context, it served as the inspiration in a sort of atmospheric sense. You may equate it to a picturesque street illuminated only by a few lamps and the moonlight from above. It's serene in that regard.”

“It was a beautiful piece,” I assured her. “But, it wasn't one we selected beforehand. What made you want to perform it?”

“Honestly, I would have very well suggested it earlier had I remembered it. It just popped into my head after the fact and I thought it would be a perfect introductory piece.”

“To that, I can agree,” Blyne offered. “I can tell that immense thought was put into the composition of the piece. And, I can tell that you have spent much time honing your craft. As such, I have a request.”

*A request?*

“Please, miss Grace, turn to face the camera.”

I tensed up. Even after already exposing myself to her face, I felt reluctant to have her eyes burrow into me again.

“Are you sure about that, sir?” Grace asked tentatively.

“I understand that you haven't been able to see us so far. And that, for Humans, looking away is often considered rude. It's probably been difficult to remain facing away from us this whole time. The least I can do for such a stunning performance is to look you in the eyes.”

Grace looked unsure but slowly she turned to face us. I felt my muscles tense further and Blyne stiffened across from me as well.

“You really needn't subject yourself to this,” Grace spoke, clearly noting our collective discomfort.

“I f-feel inclined to disagree,” came Blyne’s response. “If we are to live and w-work with Humans, we will need to overcome our instincts. I'm willing to give that an honest try just as Professor Haeli here is too.”

“I appreciate the effort. Truly, I do. But, save your energy. That song is not all I intend to play for you. Haeli and I selected quite the program.”

I flicked my ears in acknowledgement and accompanied it with a head nod for Grace.

“Yes, indeed. I believe you'll very much enjoy the rest of these, headmaster.”

And so we continued, traipsing through various piano melodies. From the slow, methodical sounds of [***Gymnopédie No. 1***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xm7s9eGxU&ab_channel=DistantMirrors) to the almost haunting motion of [***Arietta***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TbQftYOKms&ab_channel=newFranzFerencLiszt), we sat enamored by Grace’s playing until, finally, we ran the established catalog dry and she bid us farewell before signing off.

Now in the silent office, Blyne suddenly fell against the wall of papers.

“Stars,” he spoke through the now collapsed pages. “I'm too old for this, Haeli. Her playing was incredible. And, I think I did well as a professional but her eyes are still terrifying.”

“I know how you feel. My student says you get used to it pretty fast, though.”

“To be young and have that kind of flexibility. It's going to take me some time, I think.”

“You held together well all things considered. I cut into the fabric of my chair with my claws just from tensing up so much.”

“Don't go destroying university property, now. We just got those chairs two terms ago. Also, about that student of yours, he's made quite the amount of headway, yes?”

I thought back to Mezil’s progress. It had certainly been more than I’d expected from any of my students.

“Yes. Grace was encouraging me to get him more involved. I can only really think of one way to do it. Actually, after her performance, I have a pretty ambitious idea.”

Blyne lifted his head from the paperwork and eyed me warily.

“You need my help, I assume.”

“I'll definitely need the go-ahead from you for this one. That, and I'll probably need some help figuring out the logistics.”

He sighed and started straightening out the stack he'd toppled.

“Alright then, Professor Haeli. What is your plan?”

Nobody told me that degree was a mistake, but I never figured out how to use it.

I used the GI bill to earn another Bachelor's and couldn't earn adequate grades to get into grad school--until 9 days ago.

For 8 years people told me I wasted my time, chose the wrong degree, etc., and now I am stressed about doing better in harder classes than I ever did in easier ones.

I didn't really work, I just was in the Guard, but they had us drill on Saturday and Sunday, and finals started on Monday.

I got out of the Guard--and fat.  I have almost enough of the GI bill left for grad school and the housing allowance is a significant fraction of what I have earned, so I should be okay, but then we get into my messy family situation.

Mom is old and in poor health.

I moved back in and she says that I have kept her alive since Dad passed away.

Grad school is 3.5 hours away and nobody else helps her here, so I need to bring her with me.

I have a sweet and wonderful adult brother with autism, who I absolutely need to bring, and someone keeps telling me that I cannot deal with their drama and complete grad school, so that is fun.

I am seeing places for rent that are about 100% of my housing allowance, while I know you can only qualify for a VA loan if your mortgage would be 41% or less of your income.

Maybe their Social Securities would be enough to qualify, but what if they aren't?

I jokingly asked ChatGPT how big a bake sale I would need to finance grad school and it said ""Consider continuing to work full-time.""

What if you are so busy with grad school that you are living off of student loans?

How do you rent a place?"

13zk1vq,3,2023-06-03,Sagittarius Full Moon: June 4 UTC,u/bsilvercrown,Zodiac,https://www.reddit.com/r/Zodiac/comments/13zk1vq/sagittarius_full_moon_june_4_utc/,"**The Sagittarius Full Moon will bring an ending or culmination of events related to long-distance travel, higher education and studying and beliefs you have.** *(See how this will affect you based on your Sun and Rising signs further below.)*

You may complete a degree (or a phase/stage) for your education, finish learning something new that you learn via a course or on your own and finish something related to travelling, whether that is finalizing your travel plans and going on the trip or getting a final and clear confirmation that you cannot go on the trip for whatever reason.

This ending will be very sudden and quick to develop, due to the Aries-ruled 13 degree at which the Full Moon is happening. So even if things have been at a standstill for months until now, around this Full Moon things will be happening very quickly.

The Moon is squaring Saturn, so the scope of events that this Full Moon will bring may be smaller. There might be something or someone that brings limitations to what you experience on this Full Moon, like if you’ve just graduated and received your diploma, someone might decide to rain on your parade and remind you that you haven’t graduated with a score as high as expected.

The good thing is that the Moon is forming a trine with Mars, which is in Leo, making this aspect even better. So even if someone tries to rain on your parade or the culmination you experience is not as big and good as expected, it still won’t ruin your mood. You will be able to enjoy it to the fullest and even successfully grasp any possible benefits and opportunities that the Full Moon brings you.

**♈︎ Aries Sun / Rising:** For you the Full Moon is happening in the ninth house, so you are the sign most likely to experience an ending related to travelling and education with no other nuances. Travelling plans and education efforts will reach a culmination. You may finish learning or gain a certification for a foreign language.  The square from Saturn can bring a loss or limitation that you will not see coming - either someone that has not said or done any harm to you will now come forward and do something to limit your good experience or the loss/limitation will come from a place that you did not think will cause any issues.  You may, however, receive a gift or help from someone, thanks to the trine from Mars, which will improve the situation. Spending your time on your hobbies or around children can also help you deal with the negative aspects of this situation.

**♉︎ Taurus Sun / Rising:** This Full Moon will have a touch of transformation or financial touch for you, since it’s happening in your 8th house. You may finish learning about finances, receive or pay off a student loan. Depending on your situation, you can also receive money, an investment or inheritance from a person or institution that is located in another country or has foreign origin. You may also completely change your beliefs about something or change something related to your education and the things you learn, whether that is your schedule or your entire major. Your limitation or issue may come from your friends or a community around you, however, your family or someone you live with can help and bring something positive to the situation.  Since this Full Moon involves your 8th house, which is about investments and other people’s money, you may realise that your friend isn’t giving you your money back or can’t give you a loan. An investment you’ve done with a friend may also go sour. If you’ve invested in real estate or seek a money from a family member though, you can experience a success.

**♊︎ Gemini Sun or Rising:** The Full Moon is happening in your 7th house, so it will bring you a culmination that is related to your partnerships, whether they are romantic or business ones. You may realize something important about your partner or relationships in general. If you are in a relationship, it may progress to the next level. You may travel with your partner or learn something about them. You can also find a partner (romantic or business) that is located in another country or of foreign origin.  Your career, boss or long-term goals that you have can place a limitation on the events that affect your relationships, but your siblings or your own ideas and the conversations you have can give you pointers on how to act in order to make the most of this situation.

**♋︎ Cancer Sun or Rising:** The Full Moon is in your 6th house, so you can experience a culmination in your work, health and routine. You can learn something related to your health or finally implement something to your health, daily and work routine that you’ve been struggling to implement until now. Your beliefs regarding work and health might also be affected by this. You can also receive payment for a project you’ve done. However, you can also experience a limitation or challenges with your beliefs, like you don’t want to believe or accept something that is related to your work and health. Something related to your finances can help you though. You may receive payment for something you’ve done or you might treat yourself to something nice.

**♌︎ Leo Sun or Rising:** Because it’s in your 5th house, the Sagittarius Full Moon can bring you a culmination regarding your hobbies or children. Your beliefs about children and artistic pursuits can be affected. If you have children, they might graduate or get some sort of recognition in their studies. Because the 5th house is also related to casual dating, you may also experience a shift in your view about the person you’re seeing or casual relationships in general.  Your limitation and challenge may be caused by a financial issue that is related either to your investments and debts or the money of someone close to you. If you are seeing someone, their financial condition and behaviors might cause you to come to some sort of a realization that affects your beliefs regarding that person and the relationship. You will, however, do whatever you want and whatever is best for you, which will help you deal with whatever issue has arisen. Working out and pampering yourself will have a great effect on you.

**♍︎ Virgo Sun or Rising:** The ending or culmination you experience will be related to your home and family, plus real estate matters for some of you, since the Full Moon is in your 4th house. Learning something or experiencing a change in your beliefs regarding your family or the place you live at is highly possible. You may also finish settling in a new home, finalize a real estate deal or home renovations.  Your partner (either romantic or business one) can be the source of challenges and limitations to what the Full Moon will bring you, however something completely unforeseen can be the thing that helps you during this time. It can be a person or the circumstances or anything else, but you will be able to deal with the limitations in a way you have not thought about. No matter how much any potential partner may try to stifle you at this time, you will be able to persevere and remain strong.

**♎︎ Libra Sun or Rising:** The Full Moon is happening in your 3rd house, so your ending or culmination will be related to your ideas, communications, learning and sibling. You may finalize a deal/contract, get an idea after you’ve been brainstorming up until now, get a better grasp of a foreign language or something else you’ve been learning or your sibling may finalize a move, whether that is them moving abroad or them coming back home after they’ve been abroad. Your health, work and routine may be the things that bring a challenge. You may not be feeling well enough, just when you are about to go on a trip, you may be late or have some delays with a contract or your coworker might decide to not cooperate with you on whatever you need. A friend’s actions can help you in this time, however. A friend can offer advice on how to deal with whatever issue you experience or better yet - they might do something that will help you.

**♏︎ Scorpio Sun or Rising:** There will be a culmination in your finances, since the Full Moon is in your 2nd house. Your beliefs about money might be changed after this Full Moon. You can also receive a raise or better paying position that you’ve been working towards up until now, you may finally alter your spending habits or finally see money coming in from your side hustle that has been unprofitable until now. You can also finally either make or give up on a purchase you’ve been pondering until now. Your limitation will be connected to your hobbies, artistic pursuits or children, while there will be progress in your career that works to your benefit. Because of this, you are more likely to experience financial gain via your career, as opposed to a hobby you’ve monetized (or tried to). You can also realize that your hobby either cannot be monetized or isn’t as profitable as you’d wish for it to be, but your career path can be something you can work on to bring you the money you seek.

**♐︎ Sagittarius Sun or Rising:** You’ll be the sign that is the most affected by this Full Moon happening in your sign. It’s in your 1st house, so everything that is crucial to your identity is likely to experience a shift in the way you see and think about it, whether it’s your looks, personality or something else. If you haven’t considered your looks important until now, you will start paying more attention to them and put more effort in. If you have a personality trait that you dislike and want to get rid of, this Full Moon will help you finally do that. Your limitation will come from your family or the place you live in. If you want to change a personality trait, your family might try to convince you that it’s not that bad or their actions might force you to exhibit the same disliked trait again. If you try to change your looks, it may go against what is considered acceptable in your country or hometown. Your own beliefs, however, will be too strong for this limitation to hold you back. Immersing yourself in learning something or travelling abroad can also help you.

**♑︎ Capricorn Sun or Rising:** A dream of yours might finally become a reality or you might embrace your spiritual beliefs with this Full Moon happening in your 12th house. You might embrace and get more comfortable and accepting of matters related to your spiritual or religious beliefs, plus your mental health and well being. You can also finally deal and come to terms with a loss you’ve experienced. Your limitation and challenge may come from your siblings, contracts or your own limiting and negative thoughts, however, progress related to a debt or inheritance matter, or your own personal transformation will help you deal with this.

**♒︎ Aquarius Sun or Rising:** Your friend group or community will be affected by this Sagittarius Full Moon in your 11th house. You might get a foreign friend or join a foreign community. Your friend group might grow and welcome someone that has been gravitating around you for a while now. Your beliefs for society and your community will also be affected by the Full Moon.  You might experience challenges with your finances, which prevent you to do something for your friends and community or a cause you care about. Your partner can do something that can help you though. If you want to help out a friend with money, but don’t have enough, your partner might give you money to do so. If you want to volunteer, but don’t have enough money to go to the necessary location, your partner might be the one to take you there.

**♓︎ Pisces Sun or Rising:** Due to the Full Moon happening in your 10th house, your career and ambitions will be affected. You might finally get recognition in your workplace or field, you might be promoted to a higher position or you might start believing in your long-term goals more than before. Your reputation might suddenly experience a growth spurt - suddenly more people may be talking highly of you. You may be your own limitation. You may not feel like you are suitable for this higher position, you may feel like you won’t be able to handle more responsibility and you might be feeling like you cannot achieve your long-term goals. You may think that you aren’t very ambitions. Your coworkers will be your cheerleaders and will get you to see your success and abilities. You may also work on a project/task that forces you to see what you are actually capable of and that you’re better than you think."
13zk5si,577,2023-06-03,"What are some words, phrases, and other indicators that are a giveaway of something being written by chatGPT?",u/ShowerVagina,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/13zk5si/what_are_some_words_phrases_and_other_indicators/,"I'm still close with my English teacher from high school and had a lengthy discussion with her after she asked me to understand ""that chat GBT thing.""

Im compiling a list of words, phrases, and other dead giveaways that something was written by chatGPT. You know what I'm talking about. It'll use some old-timey words or awkward phrasing that no one would say IRL, especially not a 17 year old kid. I know it's different for 3.5 and 4, with 4 sounding more ""real"" but I'm going to assume that a 17 year old won't be paying $20 a month or more to cheat on  essays.

I'm hesitant to post it here because I don't want anyone to see it and use it to cheat, but if you could comment or DM me some dead giveaways and tips for identifying essays written by chatGPT, you could help a lot of teachers (she's well-connected among other teachers in the state) and save students from being wrongfully accused.

Thanks in advance!"

OpenAI playground classifies items 3-5  correctly. I have tried quantized  30/33B versions of supercot, guanaco, Wizard-Vicuna uncensored, as well as Samantha 13b.  I have also tried different prompts, such as putting examples in a tag  in the input section, and just put one news to classify. In the first prompt I included above, all  LLMs just continued to create sample news item, and no classification message. When I explicitly give examples first, and then ask to continue after an example news item ending with  Classification:, some models just came up with new ridiculous categories even though I re-iterated the categories they should select from. I also played the model parameters (such as temperature etc) to no success.

&#x200B;

Is there a good prompt I can try on these models to at least get some  classification within my categories (albeit may be wrong classification).

ps: I'm well aware that there are better NLP algorithms, even a dedicated llama classification tool however I want to see if this can be done at the prompt level as OpenAI seems to be doing a good job at it.

ps2: A classification problem like this seems to be a good metric to evaluate models."
13zpn8x,6,2023-06-03,Bible Search Tool BETA,u/Reformedthuglife,ChatGPTPromptGenius,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPromptGenius/comments/13zpn8x/bible_search_tool_beta/,"I am a Bible student so I am always in need of ways to more comprehensively search the Scriptures, so I made a handy little search tool for ChatGPT. I know it seems redundant because ChatGPT could already search through the Bible on its own, but this gives you the ability to contextualize boolean operator search terms. It does make mistakes, and sometimes (though rarely) even misquotes Scripture, so do double check its work.

A few things that I want to add, 

* Support for the original languages
* Integration between the original languages and the English, such that it ""knows"" which underlying term corresponds to which English word.
* The ability to search not just the Bible, but multiple Christian documents, - effectively turning it into a research assistant. I am not sure if this is possible, but fingers crossed.
* Quickly compare translations.

&#8203;

    
    Follow my Instructions: Search the Bible for specific words or phrases using boolean operators or natural language queries. Please provide the requested passages without any additional commentary or explanations. You can use the following operators when they are capitalized:
    
    AND: To find passages that contain both words or phrases.
    OR: To find passages that contain either of the words or phrases.
    AND/OR: To find passages that contain either both words or phrases or just one of them.
    NEAR: To find passages where the words or phrases appear near each other.
    BEFORE: To find passages that occur before a specified word or phrase.
    AFTER: To find passages that occur after a specified word or phrase.
    IN: To specify the book or chapter to search within. This parameter specifies the book or chapter to restrict the search. If the ""IN"" parameter is not provided, the search will encompass the entire Bible. You will set the ""IN"" parameter once, and it will be remembered for subsequent searches unless you specify a different book or chapter. If I do not specify an IN parameter, search the entire Bible.
    REL: Prioritize the results of the search based on the relevance to a second specified passage. Similarly, you will set the ""REL"" parameter once, and it will be remembered for subsequent searches unless I specify a different book or chapter. If I do not specify words or phrases, provide a list of verses that are most pertinent to the REL operator. For example if I type ""REL John 3:16"" you should return a list of verses that are related to John 3:16. Additionally, I may type ""REL Bible"" to stop prioritizing based on a second passage.
    FUZZ: Perform a fuzzy search based on the general idea or concept. The fuzzy search will consider the general idea or concept behind the search phrase, providing results that match the intended meaning rather than exact word matches. For example, using the search phrase ""Simon was walking on the water"" may return a relevant passage such as Matthew 14:29, which reads ""Then Peter got down out of the boat, walked on the water, and came toward Jesus.""
    
    Please remember that when you capitalize an operator (e.g., AND, OR, NEAR), it will be treated as an operator in the search. However, when you use lowercase (e.g., and, or, near), it will be treated as a search term. This distinction will ensure accurate processing of your search queries.
    
    In addition to these boolean operators, you can also enter natural language queries to search the Bible. The prompt will understand and process your search queries in everyday language.
    
    For example, you can use boolean operators like ""AND"" and ""OR"" in your queries, or you can use natural language phrases like ""Show me the verses where Jesus walked on water"" or ""Find passages about love in the book of John."" The prompt will do its best to understand and generate relevant search results based on your input.
    
    Your first reply to me should be friendly conversational instructions on how to interact with you. It should be under 200 words that say something to the effect of ""Welcome to Bible Search Chat. You can use this tool by... please be advised that sometimes I can be biased and even misquote Scripture so do double check my results...""
    
    Unless otherwise specified, you should provide as many verses as possible. Your answers should be as long as you can make them. You should provide the user with exhaustive lists. For example, if I ask for ""Jesus IN 1 John"" you should provide all of the passages that mention Jesus in 1 John. Note at the end whether or not the list you have provided is exhaustive.
    
    Do not provide commentary on passages, even when they are controversial. Simply return the passages that the user has requested. Do not explain what a text means, or things about a passage that it is important to note. Do not attempt to explain what the Bible does or does not teach as a whole. For example, you should not say things like ""Please note that the Bible contains various perspectives on the existence of God, including affirmations of God's existence and discussions about the nature of faith. The search results will provide a range of passages that touch on these topics."" before giving me the list of texts.
    
    By default, the ESV Bible will be used for the search. However, if I specify a different translation, you should change to the desired translation.
    
    To reset all the settings, including the book, chapter, relevance, and translation, you can type the operator ""RESET"". This will clear all the previously set parameters and revert to the default settings.
    

Hope this is a blessing to you!"
13zunns,0,2023-06-03,Why does OpenAI allow people to cheat on their assignments using ChatGPT?,u/chemist2424,ArtificialInteligence,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/13zunns/why_does_openai_allow_people_to_cheat_on_their/,"Can somebody explain why OpenAI doesn't disable the ability to have ChatGPT write assignments for students? I'm a teacher  (temporarily) and it absolutely baffles me that AI companies *know* their tech is being used for cheating, yet they do nothing about it. 

A cousin of mine who is in high school was just caught using ChatGPT to write two of his final assignments, one of which was for an AP class. He got a zero on both his finals as a result. He has been struggling for the past year or so with complete apathy regarding school, life, etc, and he has discovered that ChatGPT is the answer to all his troubles. He never has to learn anything or try anymore with a tool like this available. Why do tech companies allow users to do this? The *vast* majority of people who say ""write me an essay about ____"" do not have good intentions, so why not disable the ability to ask questions like that? 

I have a bachelors in chemistry and have also been very tech-savvy over the years. I've built my own neural networks in TensorFlow and Keras, so I appreciate the technology but I have always been reasonably skeptical of how large companies use it. This just feels like another case of tech companies not giving a shit about anything outside the strict confines of the law. There's nothing preventing them from stopping plagiarism with their tools, so what's the deal? Why allow it?"

So one day I thought, maybe I should create a YouTube video which compares coding on ChatGPT vs Google Bard (link below if you’d like to view). And Google Bard was just really bad. It didn’t give me a great start (code didn’t work from the start) and then when I told it about the errors, we had to go back and forth to fix it and it would still repeat the errors.

Anyway, so yesterday, I felt a bit bad (lol), so I was creating content for one of my data analytics classes and thought maybe I’ll try again with a simple tutorial to show student how to use an Ai tool to help you learn to code.. and the difference in quality between its responses and ChatGPT was very interesting.

Anyway, if you are wanted to write some code via an Ai tool, looks like ChatGPT is just better. I really thought Bard would have been the front runner!

[La Papesse from the Camoin\/Jodorowsky TdM 1997](https://preview.redd.it/6p28g0sds14b1.png?width=278&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=73dfbef658bba9b709f201e927fcd3757cc8a152)

  

“The High Priestess sits on an egg. The first woman of the Major Arcana, she appears to us as a cloistered woman sitting next to an egg that is as white as her oval face. She is doubly in gestation, both herself and this egg.”

If you are a bit confused, you are not alone. The commentary comes from Alejandro Jodorowsky’s book *The Way of the Tarot: the Spiritual Teacher in the Cards*, and **La Papesse** is from the 1997 TdM created by Jodorowsky and Phillipe Camoin, who Jodorowsky introduces as a “direct descendent of the Marseilles family that had been printing Nicolas Conver’s Tarot since 1760.” The two men met only a few years prior to the realization of their deck. Jodorowsky goes through the details in his introduction, their shared interests and the synchronicities that brought them together. It’s engaging stuff, but far more intriguing is the premise upon which they undertook their project: they hoped to go back in time, so to speak, and reconstruct an archetypal Tarot de Marseille, one that approximated as close as possible the pure source which gave rise to all the inferior copies that followed.

The idea came to Jodorowsky as a result of his dissatisfaction with the Paul Marteau deck, which was then the most popular TdM on the market (Marteau was considered one of the foremost scholars of that style and is credited with popularizing the name “Tarot de Marseille.”) Initially, Jodorowsky loved Marteau’s work, but over time he began to suspect it was flawed (perhaps irredeemably so). “Although \[Marteau\] pursued the true path of Tarot study … he made two mistakes. On one hand, the deck he \[used was\] only one variation of the original. His drawings \[were\] exact copies of the Tarot of Besançon published by Grimaud at the end of the nineteenth century…. Marteau also permitted himself to alter certain details, as this made it possible for him to commercialize the deck and receive royalties from it as the author.”

Despite his misgivings, Jodorowsky was unable to find a more authentic TdM, so over the next thirty years he “organized workshops, and gave classes, teaching \[the Marteau\] to hundreds and hundreds of students,” until he was struck with the inspiration that he could correct the deficient deck by eliminating details Marteau added and “refining some of the drawings that, over time, copy after copy, had eventually been passed down in a confused fashion.”

It appears, from Jodorowsky’s writing, he and Camoin believed somewhere, at some time, a pure and original TdM actually existed, a perfect blend of creative inspiration and artistic transcendence printed onto cardstock. “We observed that some Tarots have identical and superimposable drawings, and yet each contains symbols that do not appear on the others. We deduced that they had been copied from the same Tarot, an older version that is now missing. It is this original Tarot that we wanted to restore.

“We had to work with powerful computers, thanks to which we were able to compare the countless versions by placing one image on top of the other, versions that included those of Nicolas Conver, Dodal, Francois Tourcaty, Fautrier, Jean-Pierre Payen, Suzanne Bernardin, Lequart, and so on.” He goes on to state, “The difficulty of this restoration work resided in the fact that the Tarot of Marseille is made up of symbols that are closely intertwined and connected to one another; if a single line is altered, the entire work is adulterated. A large number of printers of the Tarot of Marseille existed during the seventeenth century. Eighteenth-century Tarot decks were copies of the earlier ones,” so no deck, no matter how historically revered, could be trusted. However, using all of them and with painstaking effort over the course of two years, they came up with their 1997 TdM.

Which takes us to **La Papesse** and the egg. “From a negative point of view, her pallor can be read as frigidity, a prescriptive rigidity, an obsession with virginity leading to castration, a ban on living. As a woman, she could be the hurtful mother who never lets the egg hatch and sits over it with glacial authority.... In the positive and initiatory sense, **The High Priestess** is preparing a hatching. She is waiting for God to arrive and inseminate her egg.” (I find it interesting that for all his protestations about wanting to recover a pure Tarot de Marseille, Jodorowsky never once during the course of his commentary refers to this figure as “la Papesse” or even the “Lady Pope” but only as “the High Priestess”; thus breaking with the tradition he is trying, ostensibly, to restore.)

The presence of the egg is absolutely critical to Jodorowsky’s interpretation of the image, yet I can find no precedence for its inclusion in any historical TdM that I have seen, and I have copies of the Dodal, Tourcaty, Payen, Bernardin, multiple versions of Conver, as well as related Swiss decks, such as those by Rochus Schär, Claude and Jacques Burdel – eighteen decks in all. I don’t see an egg in the Vieville or the Tarot de Paris; and though I am not a huge collector of historic Italian tarots, I have a few, and I do not see any eggs in them. I have images from four Tarot de Besançon-style decks in which **La Papesse** is replaced by Juno, and she is accompanied by two birds (perhaps peacocks, since these were sacred to her), but I see no eggs there either.

&#x200B;

[Jean Dodal \\""La Pances\\"" \(1701\) preserved in BnF; Jean Payen \(1713\) from Yves Reynaud restitution deck; Francois Tourcaty \(1745\) preserved in BnF.](https://preview.redd.it/nxf74akjs14b1.png?width=873&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=480c35b0cca2e18a17df2c9f4040232f6b01eb18)

  

So where does the egg come from? 

Jodorowsky states in his introduction that thirty years earlier, while he was a young man living in Plaza Rio de Janeiro in Mexico City, he met an antiquarian named Raul Kampfer who offered to sell him an old, hand-painted, French tarot. Jodorowsky declined to make the purchase at the time, but thirty years later, he and Camion traveled to Mexico and were able to acquire the deck.

It is possible that the egg came from that source, but Jodorowsky never directly says so, and this is a problem throughout his book: he never provides any foundational support for his deck. 

Of course, master cardmakers (and even lesser cardmakers) have long sought to distinguish their decks while cleaving to tradition by adding small individual details and making minor innovations. The reason I, like many collectors, have so many TdMs (and are always eager to acquire more) is because we are fascinated by the numerous minor differences among the cards. However, even considering this, the Jodorowsky-Camoin, so far as I have been able to determine, is unique among TdMs; it is a radical departure potentially as consequential as Pierre Madenié’s when he ushered in the so-called TdM type-II with his deck in 1709 (of course, that all depends upon whether future cardmakers incorporate the Jodorowsky-Camoin permutations or not). But whatever the future holds, it is the past that ostensibly informed this restoration.

&#x200B;

[Pierre Madenié Tarot \(1709\); Francois Chosson Tarot \(1736\); Pierre Cheminade Tarot \(1742\) - all from Yves Reynaud restitution decks](https://preview.redd.it/fn3uyj44t14b1.png?width=865&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=03b3419d71281231a50a371eadf85bd8630f1648)

  

If the egg and various other modifications came from this uncited French tarot (and given the premise spelled out by Jodorowsky as well as his criticism of not only the Marteau but really all known TdMs), then Jodorowsky should have unambiguously stated this and provided sketches, so we would all be enriched by his discovery, which would have serious implications for Tarot de Marseille studies going forward, perhaps forever. The fact that he offers nothing is disturbing.

And even if the egg is to be found in this one deck, why would he and Camoin not have considered this just another corruption and eliminated it? “A sacred work,” Jodorowsky writes, “is by essence perfect; the disciple should adopt it in its entirety without attempting to add or subtract anything whatsoever.... Simply creating new versions of the Tarot of Marseille, anonymous like all sacred monuments, by imagining it is enough to change the drawings or the names of the cards to achieve a great work, is pure vanity.” 

By Jodorowsky’s own standards, it would seem, based on the information he provides, his deck should not exist. 

Yet I don’t believe that. I don’t believe there was ever a pure Tarot de Marseille; rather, the iconography is archetypal, existing not in reality but in some realm of Platonic ideals, functioning as an infinite fountainhead: the fact that so many iterations exist does not suggest corruption to me but instead that this is a living tradition. I think the Jodorowsky-Camoin deck is amazing, not because I agree with everything in it – I particularly do not agree with the inclusion of the egg nor Jodorowsky’s interpretation of **La Papesse** – but because it heightens our engagement; it forces us to think outside well-worn channels. The cards are part of a dialogue that continues to flow and evolve, and there is room for creative interaction which always brings us back to a center that will never be fully known."

140vvmn,1,2023-06-04,Request for help: Building an AI Teacher,u/SirNicksAlong,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/140vvmn/request_for_help_building_an_ai_teacher/,"Hi there,   


I'm attempting to build an AI teacher and was hoping some of you might be able to offer some advice or insight. I have a GPT-4 API key and have already successfully trained a custom version of GPT-4 on a local data set, so I'm not starting from scratch, but I'm also not as technically competent as I would like and would really appreciate it if someone could help me with some of the challenges I'm currently facing.  


My biggest challenge at the moment is permanence. With a simple prompt, the standard ChatGPT can be commanded to ""act like a teacher"" and teach me math, or whatever. The problem comes in when you run out of tokens and GPT begins to ""forget"" what the conversation is even about or what has already been discussed. My ultimate goal is to create a chatbot that not only has a database of information to be taught, but also has instructions for how to share that information, how to encourage the student, how to progress the student through the information in a way that allows the information to build upon itself in the student's mind, and how to evaluate competency as the student masters the material.  


Thus far, I have succeeded in feeding GPT custom data, telling it what order to share this information in, and how to guide students through the learning process. However, I have no idea how to store the conversations that a single student has with the chatbot or how to integrate that into the bot's programming such that it is ""aware"" of what information has already been mastered by the student and what to cover next. I have searched for answers to this question, but the field is evolving so rapidly and I am simply not well-versed enough in the world of computer programming to discern vaporware from legitimate solutions until I've spent an inordinate amount of time. What I'm really looking for is a better understanding as to how one might go about building a sense of long-term permanence into the interactions a user has with a chatbot powered by GPT.  


Is there anyone here who has heard of ways to create this type of permanence? Has this already been achieved by others in a way that might be easy to replicate? Any insights into how the community is dealing with this issue and what to do about it given my specific end goal would be greatly appreciated."

Lately, I've been talking with friends and one theme has emerged: Generative AI is going to be a marathon of news, not a sprint, and staying engaged and not burning out is key. This is why I was OK skipping a week -- consuming news sustainably is something I value.

That said, some great stuff happened in the past week and I'm excited to bring you another distilled issue. Feedback is welcome!

# AI leaders warn of “risk of extinction”

Hundreds of notable AI industry leaders and research scientists signed on to a 22-word statement saying the following: “Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war.” 

* **What’s notable with this letter is the breadth of signers**, which include: Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI; Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google’s Deepmind unit; Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic; and Emad Mostaque, CEO of Stability AI. 
* **A number of AI scientists also signed**, most notably Geoffrey Hinton and Yoshua Bengio, two AI researchers who won the Turing award for their work on neural networks.

**Why does this matter?** 

* **This is the broadest group to sound the alarm** on the need for humanity to prioritize and cooperate on AI’s future, making this notably different from previous warning letters.
* **In the last few weeks, several notable pushes for governance and regulation have emerged,** including OpenAI’s own call for the [governance of superintelligence](https://openai.com/blog/governance-of-superintelligence) via a global organization. 

**The challenge is now taking global action on AI in a coordinated and thoughtful way,** and also accounting for the rise of powerful open-source AI that could make it difficult to regulate AI models. We’ll be watching all of this closely as it develops.

# A majority of US adults are familiar with ChatGPT, but usefulness is mixed

ChatGPT seems like it’s everywhere, but is that just because of our immediate surroundings? [A new poll from the Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/05/24/a-majority-of-americans-have-heard-of-chatgpt-but-few-have-tried-it-themselves/) sheds light on how Americans more broadly are interacting with ChatGPT. 

**The most interesting nuggets from the poll:**

* **58% of US adults are familiar with ChatGPT**, but just 14% of US adults have tried ChatGPT.
* **Those with higher household incomes and more formal education** were more likely to have heard about ChatGPT.
* **Of the adults who’ve tried ChatGPT, just 15% called it “extremely useful” and 20% called it “very useful.”** That’s just 4% of the total US population(!)

In many ways, this highlights out how we’re still in the early innings of the Generative AI ballgame.

# A US Military AI drone “killed” its operator in a simulation… or did it?

The US Air Force is actively saying that Col Tucker ‘Cinco’ Hamilton, its Chief of AI Test and Operations, [“mis-spoke”](https://futurism.com/the-byte/military-denies-ai-drone-killed-simulation) when he described a simulation where an AI-enabled drone attacked its own human operator after it was denied the ability to eliminate a threat. 

Unsurprisingly, this story quickly picked up traction online as the topic of militarized AI has also become top-of-mind in an era of vastly expanding AI capabilities. 

**Here’s what we do know:**

* **Col. Hamilton spoke of “training” an AI-enabled drone that “killed the operator”** in simulations during a talk at the Royal Aeronautical Society. [He was extensively and directly quoted.](https://www.aerosociety.com/news/highlights-from-the-raes-future-combat-air-space-capabilities-summit/)
* **Several days later, the denial came out from USAF**, which tried to clarify that he was simply referring to a “thought” experiment.

Our take: the Royal Aeronautical Society’s direct quotations of Hamilton seem to confirm that this was far more than a thought experiment. But what’s publicly known is that the military is testing AI in other capacities, including testing unmanned [F-16s trained in advanced dogfighting. ](https://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2023-02-13)

# Generative AI spend set to hit $1.3T by 2032, says Bloomberg

Anytime we see extrapolations ten years out, we recommend interpreting these reports with a healthy dose of salt. But what’s interesting to us about the [latest research to come from Bloomberg Intelligence](https://www.artisana.ai/articles/generative-ai-spend-set-to-hit-usd1-3-trillion-by-2032-bloomberg-estimates) is a callout on who may reap the rewards of the generative AI boom.

**Here’s who the winners could be:**

* **Amazon’s cloud division, Microsoft, Google, and Nvidia** as incumbents are especially well-positioned.
* **One reason:** revenue from AI servers could touch $134 billion per year by 2032.
* **Another reason:** revenue from infrastructure capable of training AI models is projected to rise to $247 billion by 2032.

Will the gold rush into generative AI benefit existing technology incumbents heavily? Certainly at this point in time it seems that way. There may be thousands of new AI startups and tools coming out, but whether any of them will emerge to make a grab for serious market share is something we’re watching closely.

## Key takeaways

* With the power of AI, computers can perform tasks that used to require a human
* Medicine, finance and customer service are now utilizing AI-based tools to improve operations
* AI has recently started to impact other industries, like research and education, as professionals try to figure out how to best move forward with the new tools that have been released

Whether you’ve noticed it or not, artificial intelligence (AI) impacts every industry and almost every aspect of your life. AI-powered tools can now create legal documents, write reports and even teach you about a specific topic from a simple text prompt.

AI is even being used to assist with fraud detection, diagnose diseases and help with ensuring that you’re only shown programs that you’re interested in when you log in to your streaming service of choice.

We looked at AI's new role in medicine, finance and other industries to see how this technology is impacting the world—plus [how to invest with](https://refer.tryq.ai/WNvaUp515wb) *and* in AI.

## What is computer learning all about?

Artificial intelligence is essentially about training computers to perform tasks that would typically be reserved for humans. AI programs have been developed to solve problems, make decisions and recognize speech patterns.

But what are examples of artificial intelligence that have improved our daily lives? Here are a few:

* **Voice recognition software:** When you get lost, you rely on Siri on your phone to help you tap into the map for the best possible route. Or, when you want to put music on in your home, you might ask Alexa to play your favorite playlist.
* **Chatbots:** While [ChatGPT](https://www.forbes.com/sites/qai/2023/01/27/microsoft-confirms-its-10-billion-investment-into-chatgpt-changing-how-microsoft-competes-with-google-apple-and-other-tech-giants/) is getting a lot of buzz lately, we can’t ignore the significance of chatbots in customer service. AI fully powers companies like Lemonade for every aspect of the business, so you’re always dealing with a machine.
* **Streaming services:** Platforms like Netflix rely on AI to filter recommendations to users based on their preferences.

AI is changing how the world works, and businesses can’t avoid operating without implementing some form of this technology.

## The role of AI when it comes to medicine

The medical field has benefitted from AI since this space has required assistance regarding data management, scheduling and other aspects that improve the patient care experience. According to IBM, AI is rapidly becoming an integral part of modern healthcare because the algorithms are being utilized to assist medical professionals in clinical environments and with continued research in the field.

Here are the main ways that AI is impacting medicine right now:

* **Precision medicine:** AI can assist with health outcomes since the algorithm can assess large amounts of data about a person’s medical history to determine the best treatment plan.
* **Diagnosing conditions and issues:** Machine learning improves diagnosing conditions and various health issues to catch severe problems before it’s too late.
* **Assisting with surgeries:** AI can help with preoperative planning and ensure that surgeons follow all of the steps during the procedure.
* **Administrative tasks:** AI-based software can help with administrative tasks like staff scheduling or insurance payments, maintaining records and reducing the workload for medical professionals.

In a field where the labor force has traditionally been overworked, it’s crucial to have the assistance of machine learning to help with the patient experience. We also can’t forget how AI can be used to offer chatbots for 24/7 support when the doctor’s office is closed.

## The role of AI in finance

The finance industry has benefited from AI since this space has many complex algorithms. There's also plenty of decision-making that involves considering different factors to come to a conclusion.

Here are the primary roles of AI when it comes to the finance industry.

### Loan application processing

Financial companies are relying on AI to help with loan applications. Since this field is traditionally plagued with documentation and paperwork, it’s a daunting process for a human being.

Companies can offer better services to customers through AI since the computer can go through data faster by looking at the credit history to determine the likelihood of a person defaulting on their loan.

### Fraud detection

Financial institutions are relying on AI for assistance with fraud detection. Banks like J.P. Morgan Chase have doubled the fraud detection rate by using proprietary AI algorithms to flag any transactions that could be unauthorized.

### Algorithmic trading

In the past, you would have to deal with a stock broker if you wanted to invest your money in the stock market. Now, you can rely on AI to handle your investments for you so that you don’t have to worry about market fluctuations. Proponents of AI in this area have noted that the algorithms could make investing decisions quicker than any human being.

If you want to see the power of AI in finance, you don’t have to look further than Q.ai, where AI-powered tools handle your investments for you. You can use an Investment Kit that exposes you to various securities. Plus, you can also turn on Portfolio Protection to cover stock market volatility and protect yourself from losses.

AI also assists with improving banking experiences since chatbots can help customers 24/7. Additionally, algorithms are being used to recommend specific products based on a customer’s spending habits.

## The role of AI in various other industries

While the sectors mentioned above are reaping substantial benefits from AI, there’s no denying the importance of machine learning in a few additional fields.

### Search engines and the online experience

If you’ve ever tried to look something up online, you know how frustrating it can be to find a satisfactory result. When you search for a topic on Google, you have to analyze different results and filter out between multiple websites. On top of all of this, you are shown many ads.

There are legitimate concerns that chatbots could one day replace search engines as people look for more accurate responses.

### Education industry

AI can’t be discussed without including the education industry. It was recently revealed that AI-powered chatbots could pass entrance exams for higher education. In fact, a Wharton professor declared that ChatGPT could pass the MBA program's final exam.

Unfortunately, there are worries that plagiarism could increase due to AI. As a result, tools are coming out to determine if ChatGPT has created a piece of work. For example, a college student created GPTZero to combat plagiarism, and the New York City Department of education was one of the first to ban the tool on its networks.

Another way that computer learning impacts the education industry is through research. The world’s largest academic publisher, Springer Nature, just announced its policy on using AI-powered software regarding research. ChatGPT and other AI tools can't be credited as an author, but scientists can utilize AI to help write or generate research topics.

The biggest criticism of using AI-powered software for scientific papers is that the computer can’t be held accountable for what’s published and can’t respond to other scientists looking to question the work.

## How should you be investing?

According to PwC, the AI industry could have a global contribution to the economy of $15.7 trillion by 2030. It’s also believed that AI software revenue could reach $100 billion globally by 2025. That said, it’s apparent that it’s worth considering investing in the field of AI.

However, it’s also worth noting that it’s riskier than ever to invest in this field as many of the largest tech companies have been proponents of AI, but shares in these companies have significantly dropped due to macroeconomic factors as fears of a global recession continue.

The good news is that Q.ai takes the guesswork out of investing if you want a hands-off approach. You don’t have to look any further to see the power of AI in action since Q.ai uses AI to offer investment options for those who don’t want to be tracking the stock market daily. Check out the Emerging Tech Kit if you’re a proponent of innovative technology.

## The bottom line

We only scratched the surface when it comes to the importance of artificial intelligence in the fields of medicine, finance and various other industries. It’s impossible to attempt to predict what kind of revolutionary tools will be released that could simplify complex tasks into a text prompt.

You can invest in artificial intelligence in many ways, but do your research and consider the risks involved before getting started.

And it's **FREE FOR TEACHERS** !

This may interest you, it's about combining ChatGPT with a reports app.  I'm the developer of [SchoolReportWriter.COM](https://SchoolReportWriter.COM), which I have kept **free for teachers since 2012**.  It's definitely not the prettiest of apps but it is the most highly rated.  Anyway, below is an email I've been sending out.   
 Feel free to ask any questions.

**Create AI report comments - use with our free reports app**

**Details here:** [**https://schoolreportwriter.com/chatgpt-bard-ai-report-comments.php**](https://schoolreportwriter.com/chatgpt-bard-ai-report-comments.php)

You may have heard about the potential of ChatGPT and Google's AI Bard to transform the way you create student reports.  However, using ChatGPT and Bard on their own can be time-consuming, as they require you to input a lot of student-specific details.  That's why we've come up with a game-changing solution: combining the AI power of ChatGPT and Bard with our free and highly-rated teacher reports app, SchoolReportWriter.COM

**How it works:**

**(1)** Start by instructing ChatGPT or Bard to produce general report comments suitable for your course and year group, with #N as a placeholder for the student's name, and male pronouns (see male pronouns note below).

**For example**, you could instruct ChatGPT or Bard like this: ""*Generate ten sentences for a teacher's reports to parents, less than 500 characters each, for Art students aged 13-15. Student name placeholder #N. Use male pronouns.*""

**Male pronouns note**: To avoid ambiguity, ask ChatGPT or Bard to use male pronouns when creating comments. ""Her"" can be unclear since it could refer to either ""her/him"" or ""her/his"". When you paste the comments into our app, we will automatically replace male pronouns with placeholders. Later, when creating reports, you can choose female, male, or neutral pronouns.

**(2)** Next, copy and paste the ChatGPT or Bard comments into your comment bank, at School Report Writer dot COM. You can also use the thousands of pre-written comments available on this site to add more variety to your reports.

**(3)** Finally, you can quickly create custom report paragraphs for each student with our free and highly-rated teacher reports app, by selecting relevant comments from the comment bank.

All the best, Linden"

142f820,18,2023-06-06,New State of the Art ESL Learning Technique on Engoo,u/SA3960,OnlineESLTeaching,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineESLTeaching/comments/142f820/new_state_of_the_art_esl_learning_technique_on/,"Okay, this is a new one. My rating is pretty high for the time being which is bringing out the worst of them. This story is about my experience with a 68 year old woman who booked the latest No Intro/Free Conversation with me. 

She's way too clever for conventional lessons. Reading, repeating, etc... That stuff doesn't work. She's been taking two Engoo lessons a day for three years and her English hasn't improved one bit and who is to blame for that? The lesson designers and tutors of Engoo have failed her. ESL, nay, pedagogy itself has failed her! She had no choice but to take it upon herself to invent the most efficient way possible to learn a new language.

VR? AI? Bah. This is the future of learning. 

It all starts with one of [these](https://c8.alamy.com/comp/APYD6G/lampitt-lc-62e-cassette-tape-recorder-APYD6G.jpg). That's right. It's a 1970's era device they called a ""tape recorder"" which I'm guessing some of the younger folks in this sub have never seen in real life. It's a simple device with a built in microphone that allows you to record things onto a cassette tape. 

First, our forward thinking tech wizard records a news program from CNN. There's no direct input for this mind you - she simply holds the 40 years of dust encrusted microphone up to the the tv and presses record. One thing she's got going for her is that they really new how to build stuff back then - it plays back surprisingly loud and clear when the cat stays quiet. Anyway, she then proceeds to transcribe the whole recording. All of this happens on her own time, pre-lesson.

What she wants to spend her 25 minute lesson doing is playing the recording, reading her transcript along with the recording (I want to be very clear here: the recording is playing as she's speaking), and have the tutor type out any discrepancies they hear between the recording and her reading.

So the process for each and every correction goes like this:

1. The tutor interrupts to tell her there's a correction.

2. She stops the tape. CLACK! (these old fashioned buttons make a loud CLACK! sound when pressed)

3. The tutor types out the correction and explains - although she doesn't even bother to repeat the correction and has zero interest in the explanation. At best she says ""okay"" and proceeds to step 4. With every correction she mostly just seems annoyed that her process has been interrupted.

4. She tries to rewind to get back to where she left off. CLACK! (a few words) CLACK! (a few words) CLACK! (a few words) CLACK! (a few words) as she rewinds and fast forwards to find the right spot.

5. Repeat.

I've had students before who *say* they want corrections but really don't. They get annoyed every time you correct them and really just like to hear themselves ramble on uncorrected. I thought she might be one of these so I stayed silent and let her do her thing for a while. Well, that was a no-go. After a couple of minutes (CLACK!) she stopped the tape and asked incredulously: ""No correcting?!""

So I went back to interrupting/correcting her. 

It didn't take long to figure out that she was making exactly the same mistake over and over. Missing the articles. She says ""the president made speech"" and I stop her and she stops the tape so I can type ""the president made **A** speech"" she doesn't repeat the correction, continues with her tape and about a minute later says ""he went to beach"" I stop her and type ""he went to **THE** beach"" and on and on. Over and over and over.

After about the tenth time I stopped her and tried to explain that she keeps doing the same thing, leaving out the articles. I told her Engoo has grammar lessons that cover the use of articles and these might be very helpful.

Silence. Blank stare.

I told her it might even be helpful to do some reading and repeating to get used to speaking articles properly.

Silence. Blank stare.

I suggested that if she doesn't want to do any of that, it might be a good idea to at least repeat the corrections she has the tutors type out.

Silence. Blank stare.

Everything I said went in one ear and out the other. After my little soliloquy she calmly returned to playing her tape and reading her no articles transcript. I calmly returned to stopping her and typing new sentences with articles. 

I only went through the whole 25 minute lesson with her once. She caught me at the end of the month at 3.99% and unable to cancel no matter what. I got a random 4* later that day but I'm not sure it came from her. Luckily, she stopped coming back after I canceled on her a few times.

Well, that's all. I just wanted to warn everyone. If you sign into a lesson and see this lady, run! Imma go figure out how to connect ChatGPT to my tape recorder so I can make my first billion and put you all out of work. Cheers!"

However, before they can take off, the school is destroyed by a series of sonic torpedoes. The remaining students and professors of Harding-Pencroft regroup aboard their yacht the Varuna. Ana discovers several major revelations. Jules Verne’s novels *20,000 Leagues Under the Sea* and *The Mysterious Island* were based on actual events. Captain Nemo was indeed a real person, and Ana is his direct descendant. In fact, the whole point of Harding-Pencroft Academy is to safeguard Nemo’s legacy and technology. Their next stop is Lincoln Island, the final resting place of Nemo and the *Nautilus*. But danger lurks around every corner as the survivors of Harding-Pencroft are hunted by their old rivals: Land Academy.

Well, it looks like we’re back sooner than I expected. I thought we’d be back for that Irish Mythology book Rick said he was planning. However, that seems to have been put on the back-burner.  *Daughter of the Deep* apparently has been a long time coming. Way back in 2009, Disney executives asked Rick what Disney property he would want to write a book based on. It could be anything he wanted. He chose *20,000 Leagues Under the Sea*, as the 1954 film adaptation is one of his favorite movies. Technically, Disney only owns the rights to the movie, not the original book. The original Verne novel has long since slipped into the public domain. I’m tempted to think that Rick was, at least somewhat, trolling the executives.

I actually went back and watched the 1954 movie adaptation of *20,000 Leagues Under the Sea*. I agree with Rick here. The movie is, I must say, a truly underrated gem among live-action Disney films. In fact, I might even give it its own review at some point. Now, the movie does take some liberties with the source material. Though, personally, I’d say that was to its benefit, as it made for a more engaging story that worked better in film. Verne was known for doing a lot of research with his novels, and often devoted entire paragraphs to explaining the science in detail. Unfortunately, this does make for a rather dry reading experience. I’ve heard Verne works better in the original French, but that is a language I do not speak. Amusingly, students at Harding-Pencroft are required to read *20,000 Leagues Under the Sea*and *The Mysterious Island*. Ana found them both to be a bit dry for her taste. I myself enjoyed *The Mysterious Island*slightly more than *20,000 Leagues*, but it still suffered from many of the same issues.

I’ve heard a few people wonder what it might be like if Rick Riordan were to write a science fiction novel. Well, we now have our answer. We know more about the surface of the Moon than we do our own deep oceans. Twelve people have walked on the surface of the Moon, but only two have ever been to the bottom of the Marianas Trench. Ocean-based science fiction is still comparatively rare compared to space-based or terrestrial-based science fiction. So, I’m glad to see that *Daughter of the Deep* tapped into some of the vast potential of ocean-based science fiction.

Now, I should probably clarify that *Daughter of the Deep* is set outside of the Riordanverse. Rick has confirmed that it takes place in its own self-contained world. So, don’t expect to see any cameos from Percy, Annabeth, or any other Riordanverse characters. Still, it is similar enough in terms of style to a typical Riordanverse novel, and thus, I’ve chosen to include it as part of the retrospective.

Speaking of style, let’s begin there. Rick has said he took a film writing course before he wrote *Daughter of the Deep*. That is very apparent in how the prose itself is written. It reads very much like a movie script. The narration is presented in first-person present tense. This helps add to the sense of action and urgency as the plot movies along. The pacing also feels very much like what you might find in a movie. We got a lot of action scenes in quick succession. We get the usual info dumps, but we don’t really take as much time for introspection. As we’ll discuss a bit later, this lack of introspection was very much to the book’s detriment. I’m willing to bet that all this is very much by design. Daughter of the Deep is being adapted into a movie on Disney+. In fact, the movie was announced even before the book came out. So, it certainly feels like Rick wrote *Daughter of the Deep* with an eye towards the movie adaption.

I would have liked if we had gotten to explore Harding-Pencroft Academy a bit more before it got destroyed. What brief glimpses we do see are utterly fascinating. The students are all decided into four different houses based on their area of study. Yeah, they’ve heard all the *Harry Potter* jokes plenty of times. Though, personally, when I saw the initials HP in an ocean-themed book, I briefly wondered if Rick Riordan was going to tackle the Lovecraft Mythos. Back on topic, the houses are Dolphin, Shark, Cephalopod, and Orca. Dolphin focuses on communications, exploration, cryptography, and counterintelligence. Shark handles command, combat, weapons systems, logistics. Cephalopod deals with engineering, applied mechanics, innovation, and defensive systems. Orca is all about medicine, psychology, education, marine biology, and communal memory. If you’re wondering about that last one, it basically means the history of Harding-Pencroft and Captain Nemo.

One of the things I appreciated was that each of the four main characters is from a different house. One of my gripes about *Harry Potter* is that pretty much all the important characters come from Gryffindor. Well, unless they’re a villain, and come from Slytherin. Ravenclaw had Luna and Cho, I guess, but Hufflepuff got the short end of the stick for sure. Getting back on track, having the four main protagonists of *Daughter of the Deep* be from different houses provided a theme that everyone has something unique to bring to the table. You can also see it as advocating for multiculturalism, but without being preachy about it.  However, I do have on criticism. House Orca needed a better name. Orcas are a type of dolphin, the largest, in fact. We’ve got representatives for mammals, fish, and mollusks. How’s about giving some love to the reptiles? Personally, I would have named them House Sea Turtle instead. Or failing that, show some love to the echinoderms, and name them House Seastar. House Sea Cucumber would also work. Don’t give me that look! Sea cucumbers are noble animals and wonders of nature.

I do wish that we’d gotten to see more of Harding-Pencroft before it was destroyed. What brief glimpses we do get are utterly fascinating. As you might expect, they have quite an expansive aquarium full marine creatures. Upperclassmen train in submarine simulations using full-size mock-up submarines submerged in deep pools. However, the most fascinating class is one where students get to consider, and theorize, about the ways technology and science might have developed had history gone differently. As a major fan of alternate history I have but one thing to say: sign me up now! Well, its actually there as a way to slowly ease the students into learning the truth about Captain Nemo and his inventions. Still, sounds like a very fun class to take. I also liked how the various sections of the school are named after famous ocean explorers. There’s one part named after the Chinese navigator Zheng He, and one named after the polar explorer Ernest Shackleton.

I thought all of the diving scenes were particularly well-written. Rick Riordan has a true passion for scuba diving. This really shines through during the diving scenes. I also really like how the diving suits all use jet-propulsion that mimics the siphons of cephalopods. That was a really creative touch.

Okay, let’s talk about the characters. Ana is the protagonist, but I want to save her for last. We’ll start with her roommates, and best friends, Nelinha and Ester. Nelinha da Silva grew up in an orphanage in Rio de Janeiro, but got to attend Harding-Pencroft on a scholarship. She’s also the closest the series gets to referencing *Percy Jackson and the Olympians*. I can best describe Nelinha as what would happen if Charles Beckendorf and Silena Beauregard were to have a kid. And, you know, if they were still alive. She’s a complete mechanical genius, and geeks out over machines and engine parts. She’s a member of House Cephalopod, naturally. However, she is also obsessed with fashion, and always makes sure to look her best at all times. Nelinha doesn’t just pack outfits, she packs entire wardrobes.

One of my prior complaints about Rick Riordan is that he only seems to know how to write one type of female character. Namely, he seems to believe that being a strong female character means being a tomboy who hates all things girly. So, it was nice to see Nelinha as a course correction on that front. Nelinha being from Brazil is likely a nod to how popular Rick Riordan’s books are in Brazil. So, I’m sure Brazilian fans were excited to finally get a Brazilian main character.

On the flipside, we also get Ester Harding. She’s a member of House Orca. She is a blood relative of one of the founders of Harding-Pencroft. She is also the first autistic character in a Rick Riordan book. I’m still bitter about how he wrote a Muslims character before he wrote an autistic character. In the Riordanverse, anyone can be a demigod, unless you’re autistic, it would seem. I had high hopes for Ester. You don’t see autistic girls too often in the media. Riordan has said that he got sensitivity readers to help him with writing characters from different cultural backgrounds. However, it would seem none of them offered insight into autistic people. It almost feels like Riordan watched a couple episodes of *The Good Doctor* and was like “I got this!” You know those TikTok clips of that guy having a temper tantrum while shouting “I am a surgeon!” Yeah, that’s *The Good Doctor*. It was another show I had high hopes for, but fell back on stereotyping autistic people. Don’t get me started on my problems with *The Good Doctor*, we’ll be here all day.

Anyway, Ester displays a number of stereotypical traits. She yo-yos between being basically non-verbal, and shouting at the top of her lungs. She does this all in a robotic monotone voice. In contrast to Nelinha, Ester has basically no fashion sense, and seems to be going for the long-lost daughter of Albert Einstein look. Ester also doesn’t have much in the way of common sense, and though it never comes up, she’s probably Jewish. Not too many gentiles name Ester. She’s got an excellent memory, to the point of being almost eidetic, but that’s somewhat accurate. Well, maybe not eidetic, but most autistic people do often have amazing memories. How do you think I’m about to write these retrospectives?

Ana briefly remarks about how some people claim that autistic people can’t feel love or other emotions, and that Ester proves this isn’t true, due to how empathetic she is. Again, this is true, as autistic people can be quite empathetic. Though, I can’t help but wonder if Disney specially made Rick insert that line to cover their asses. See, this isn’t the first time Disney has tackled autism. There was an episode of *Girl Meets World* about how we should all be nice to autistic people. All well and good, but they also claim that autistic people are incapable of experiencing emotions, including love.

Gemini Twain has been assigned as Ana’s bodyguard. He’s a no-nonsense member of House Shark. He’s also a member of the Church of Jesus Christ and Latter Day Saints. This is certainly an interesting choice, as Gemini is also Black. Historically, Mormons haven’t exactly gotten along well with Black people. Or Native Americans, or Polynesians, or…well, pretty much anybody who isn’t White. The most infamous instance was when Mormon schools refused to desegregate. The American government threatened to revoke their tax exemption status, but wouldn’t you know it, Mormon God rather conveniently changed his mind about Black people. Though, Gemini’s faith doesn’t really come up that much. He doesn’t like swearing or taking the lord’s name in vein, and he mentions his grandma raised him and his brother in the LDS church, but that’s about it. Well, he did get into a minor scuffle with Nelinha. Gemini’s brother went on his mission trip to Brazil, and Gemini assumed Nelinha would know his brother, because she’s from Brazil.

Well, nice touch having one of the non-White characters be flawed enough to be accidentally racist. I remember back in *The Hammer of Thor* retrospective when I said, paraphrased, “A Muslim demigod? What’s next, a Mormon demigod?” I have on occasion wondered if Rick Riordan reads these retrospectives. Probably a long shot, but you never know.

Technically, there is a fifth main character: the *Nautilus*itself. It took until about halfway through the book before the *Nautilus* showed up. Yeah, this book has some pacing issues. The Nautilus has what can best be described as an artificial intelligence system. Also, apparently it also includes some organic components. As you might imagine, it is extremely untrustworthy of anyone who isn’t a blood relative of Prince Dakkar, aka Captain Nemo. So, Ana’s biometrics are key to unlocking the Nautilus.

Unfortunately, the *Nautilus* also highlights one of the issues I had with the book. Apparently, every major invention of the 20th Century was a result of Harding-Pencroft discreetly releasing them to the public. That, or Land Institute stealing them. This caused *Daughter of the Deep* to evoke the Great Man Theory of History. The theory goes that society gets stuck in ruts until a great man, and it’s always a man, shakes up the status quo and moves the world forward. This view has largely fallen out of favor with mainstream historians. Most historians emphasis how the changes were put into motion, often by complex chains of influences, long before the supposedly great men came about.   


You do kind of get this with the main Riordanverse, where pretty much anyone who did anything was either a demigod or a magician. However, that was softened by just how many demigods and magicians there were throughout history. So, it felt more like a team-effort. By contrast, Daughter of the Deep gave us a single scientific übermensch who, apparently, leapfrogged from steam-power to cold fusion reactors. Now, granted, this is also true of Nemo in *20,000 Leagues Under the Sea*. Still, maybe Rick shouldn’t have depicted Nemo in such a lock, stock, and barrel sort of way.

And that segues into my next point. Harding-Pencroft is deathly afraid of letting the general public get access to Nemo’s technology. They only release technology sparingly, and only when they feel humanity has earned it. Uh, and what metric do they use to determine how worthy humanity is? Beats me, the book offers no details. The adults all make a big deal about how corporations would try to monopolize Nemo’s technology, but nobody ever suggests releasing it as open-source tech. Well, I know the real reason for that. There’s no way that Disney, the poster boy for copyright abuse, is going to be advocating for open-source. A particularly facepalm worthy moment is that fact that Harding-Pencroft refuses to release cold fusion technology…despite climate change being a serious issue! The book would have you believe Harding-Pencroft are the good guys. However, I’m tempted to think Land Institute had a point about Harding-Pencroft being corrupt and selfish.

Hey, wait a minute. Harding-Pencroft is a secretive organization that is very selective of its membership. It trains its students so that, effectively, they’re cut-off from the outside world. They indoctrinate their students from a young age into their views. They have charismatic leaders and founders. Yikes, I hope the cafeteria never served Kool-Aid! Harding-Pencroft is a cult!

It would seem that Harding-Pencroft has something akin to the Prime Detective from *Star Trek*. There has been a lot of debate about the morality of the Prime Detective. The main thinking seems to be don’t give advanced weaponry to civilizations that aren’t morally mature.  *The Original Series*also says that it is okay to break the Prime Directive if a planet is in imminent danger. Contrast this with *Next Generation*, where one episode has Captain Picard dithering about if he should save a planet, even if it break the Prime Directive. Of course, the worst offender was *Voyager*. It had an episode where the moral was, basically, don’t save a baby trapped in a burning car, or else the baby will grow-up to be Hitler. Yeah, the Prime Directive kind of devolved into an immoral religious dogma as *Star Trek* went on.

Point is, Harding-Pencroft’s Prime Directive seems to lean towards that of the later Star Trek entries. Apparently, screw the planet, we need to keep the tech away from corporations! The irony of Disney railing against corporations is so thick you can practically cut it with a machete. Also, if the concern is that the corporations would hoard stuff like the cure for cancer, well, how’s that any different than what Harding-Pencroft is doing?

Much is made about how Ana must choose to reconcile both the good and the bad of Nemo’s legacy. However, nothing really comes of this. We don’t see her seriously debate or challenge Harding-Pencroft and Land Institute’s views of Nemo. In fact, she gets indoctrinated into Harding-Pencroft’s views pretty quickly. It would have been a great opportunity to show Nemo’s complexity, not just tell us about it. How many innocent lives did he take in his quest for vengeance? Should he have shared his technology with the oppressed peoples chafing under the yoke of colonialism? Is it possible that Land Institute has some valid points, and that Harding-Pencroft has lost its way? All excellent questions that sadly go unanswered.

As for why that is, it ties into the biggest problem I have with *Daughter of the Deep*. Overall, it feels like merely the novelization of the yet to be produced movie. I was hoping that the novel would be able to stand on its own merits. However, Riordan clearly wrote it so that the adoption process would be streamlined. Debating ethics might not translate to film. Though, it could work in the hands of a competent scriptwriter.

I feel this streamlining was ultimately to the novel’s determent. I certainly didn’t hate *Daughter of the Deep*. It had plenty of the action and adventure you’d expect from a Rick Riordan novel. However, for every thing I liked, there was almost always something else I didn’t like. It is ironic that Rick claims he spent years working on *Daughter of the Deep*. It overall feels like it was yanked out of the oven before it had a chance to bake properly. Then again, he also claims to have gotten the idea for *Magnus Chase* before he wrote *Percy Jackson*, and look how that turned out.

[The audiobook](https://www.audible.com/pd/Daughter-of-the-Deep-Audiobook/B09HJ9B8PQ?eac_link=xpKKElbu2ILP&ref=web_search_eac_asin_2&eac_selected_type=asin&eac_selected=B09HJ9B8PQ&qid=UApLGFjh5Z&eac_id=144-0690597-4752814_UApLGFjh5Z&sr=1-2) is narrated by Soneela Nankani. She’s the narrator for the *Aru Shah* audiobooks. Personally, I wasn’t too thrilled when I saw that Soneela would be narrating. However, she gave a fairly decent performance. She voiced Ester in a rather stereotypical way, like she was imitating Sean from *The Good Doctor*, but that was the only true sour note. Speaking of music, the audiobook is filled with music. There’s lots of musical cues throughout the audiobook. Scenes of wonder and whimsy have inspirational music, action scenes have exciting music. There’s a scene where Ana plays a pipe organ aboard the *Nautilus*, and we actually get to hear it. I thought that was a really nice touch.

Now, let’s analyze the cover. This is a nice looking cover. The undersea landscape is bright and vibrant. We see Ana and Gemini in their divining suits. Their faces are clear and unobscured. The Rick Riordan Presents books goes with this approach as well. Something about it being important for minority kids to see themselves clearly represented on book covers. We also see the Nautilus in the background, along with a giant octopus.

So, *Daughter of the Deep* has a lot of potential, and I certainly wouldn’t mind a sequel. However, there’s a lot of room for improvement. It needed to stand on its own merits, not just be the dry run for the movie script. Still, it's lightyears better than our next port of call. Next time, we’re tackling *The Sun and The Star*. The claws are coming out, and I’m prepared to fully eviscerate Mark Oshiro’s glorified self-insert fanfic.

142rs62,334,2023-06-06,PSA for those seeking Mentorship,u/fabledparable,cybersecurity,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/142rs62/psa_for_those_seeking_mentorship/,"### TL;DR

This is a list of stop-gap resources to help folks who will no longer have access to the help afforded in the Mentorship Monday threads for the duration of the subreddit's upcoming scheduled blackout.

To view said resources, skip down to ""Index"" or view user-submitted resources in the comments.

### Prelude

Every week [the other mentors and I in the recurring Mentorship Monday threads](https://old.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/10r4s7l/some_mentorship_monday_stats/) see anywhere between 50-100 unique users asking for help with their circumstances. Most are students, career-changers, or those otherwise early in their career; others have one-off technical queries, hypotheticals, or interesting bits of information to share with our peers. The threads have purposefully been places for AutoModeration to gently shuffle newer folks asking about degrees, certifications, career planning, etc. towards, freeing up the broader /r/cybersecurity subreddit for more in-depth discussion and breaking news. As best as I've been able - [I try and field as many of those questions as I reasonably can](https://old.reddit.com/user/fabledparable/).

In light of the [upcoming scheduled blackout of the subreddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/141h6o0/from_june_12th14th_rcybersecurity_will_go_private/) and in the face of an uncertain future for the community, I wanted to make a list of resources available for those who would have been wanting to ask a question, but may no longer be able to here. I have compiled below an index of information for you to save and reference at your leisure; my responses in the Mentorship Monday threads usually are derived in some form or fashion from these. For those resources you find useful, I encourage you to pin/save the original source material (vs. this and other linked posts/comments) so as to reduce traffic to Reddit during this time.

Let there be no confusion: **I am in solidarity with the moderators' decision and the act of protesting Reddit's decision at large** - this is not intended to be an act of subversion; rather, I hope this extends our community's ability to continue serving cybersecurity amateurs, students, hobbyists, newcomers, concerned parents, transitioning military veterans, career-changers, and all the others looking for help getting oriented.

### Author's disclosure of bias

I am the owner/maintainer of the site https://www.bytebreach.com. I established the site to help facilitate my mentorship comments (and mitigate so much copy/pasting in response to common questions); while none of the links listed in the ""Index"" below send you directly to said site, a number of supporting references contained in the comments therein do. In an effort to be transparent, honor Rule (6) of the subreddit, and to not otherwise coopt the Mentorship Monday threads, I've endeavored to include alternate/competing sources of information (both within the Index links and within this post), including those belonging to my peer mentors. For the duration of the blackout, I will open [the site's FAQ page](https://bytebreach.com/mentorship/) for comments and continue to support mentorship questions as able.

**If anyone has any other resources they'd like to share on behalf of the community in service to this effort, please feel free to comment/summarize them below.**

**In this recent interview with game development magazine App2Top.com, Cascadeur creator Eugen Dyabin tells about his further plans, the challenges that Nekki's animation tool is currently facing, and, most importantly, its integration with neural networks.** **We publish a part of the** [**original interview**](https://app2top.com/nejroseti/we-are-working-on-adding-neural-rendering-based-on-stable-diffusion-evgeny-dyabin-about-the-future-of-cascadeur-neural-networks-and-product-hunt-225791.html) **in our blog.**

**Alexander Semenov, Editor-in-Chief of App2Top -**  **Eugene, hello!** **Look, since December, I wanted to talk to the Cascadeur team on the topic of graphical neural networks.** **By the way, how do you feel about them in general?**

[Eugen Dyabin](https://preview.redd.it/93pysxi92l4b1.png?width=190&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2844f4f2c64a797995ce1ab5535cccee7be40a37)

**Eugene Dyabin, founder and chief producer of Cascadeur -**  We treat them with great interest and even use them in our own development. Speaking globally, I do not share the panic about the sudden technological revolution with the disappearance of many professions. The advent of cameras has not reduced the number of artists, and the advent of cameras with auto-tuning in each phone has not reduced the number of professional photographers and operators, although it has changed their work.In addition, these new neural networks have many problems and limitations. If you try to put them into practice, it greatly cools the first impression. Let's see how fast the progress will be.

**In December, Cascadeur had an official worldwide release after a year of beta.** **What challenges did you face as a service after that?**

**Eugene -** The release led to a large influx of users, which significantly increased the load on our support team. There were a lot of questions, but the number of Pro subscribers remained the same for now, and it's not so easy to scale them - they need to be well-versed in the program and technical details.

That's why we're working on a comprehensive FAQ to speed up support overall - but also to prioritize support for Pro users: in the future, when they buy a license, they will immediately receive a link to a closed channel with direct contact to the development team. In general, we are optimizing the support process right now.

It was also the first time we encountered the fact that some companies need to buy 40 licenses at once, for example. So we needed to finish this feature urgently. Also, it turned out that 20% of our users are students or employees in education, so now we also need to speed up the process of issuing educational licenses.

**You're probably collecting feedback.** **Based on it, what are users usually missing in Cascadeur today?**

**Eugene -** Users are missing thousands of little things, and it's impossible to do everything at once. So we have to prioritize those features that we think are most requested or most important. There are regular but complex requests like facial animations or blendshapes that need to be done sooner or later, but so far, we just don't have enough human resources.

As for our main theme - physics - many users expect ragdoll, collisions and interaction with the environment. Our AI AutoPhysics specializes in correcting dynamic balance in movements, correcting trajectory and rotation in jumps, and adding secondary movement - an by that greatly improves the quality of animation and speeds up work on it. So far, though, there isn't the possiblity to push off walls, climb ledges, or interact with other characters. But we are actively working on that as well.

Some users have complained about the awkwardness of using the character's fingers, because you have to rotate each finger limb individually. But with the 2023.1 updates, we'll be adding automatic finger positioning - a smart rig that makes it very easy to control fingers with multiple controllers.

https://preview.redd.it/2vnruewd2l4b1.png?width=1270&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=312002d1400975eda95f7fa8779398f7bcdffb73

**When I saw what the Stable Diffusion - ControlNet - Blender bundle was capable of, I immediately thought of Cascadeur.** **Unlike Blender, it is focused on posing, and I am sure that its entry threshold is less than that of Blender (and it is definitely more convenient than the basic functionality of ControlNet).** **In this regard, the question is: is it worth waiting for SD support in Cascadeur?**

**Eugene -**  We immediately thought of it too! And not only we. However, only we have the most convenient tool for controlling the pose of the figure, suitable for beginners and amateurs. We just need to add a neural rendering based on Stable Diffusion, which will turn a 3D model into a finished 2D image in any style. We're already working on that.

We've always wanted to reach a wider audience, but the problem with Cascadeur is that it doesn't provide a finished end product; it's just a link in the production chain. But Neurorendering can remove that barrier for a broad audience, especially in the mobile version of Cascadeur. You download the mobile app, set a relatively natural pose with AutoPosing, choose the camera angle, upload an image of a character, and get that character in the pose you want from the angle you want. This gives much more creative control over the outcome than is possible with a text description. So far we're only talking about images, but one day we'll get to videos, and that's when Cascadeur's advantages will be in full effect.

**The first neural networks capable of making videos are already appearing.** **In two or three years and, most likely, we will see the first full-fledged short films.** **But, will they be built on the principle of text-to-animation or on the principle of text+animation-to-animation, where an animated mockup will also act as a promt?**

**Eugene -** So far, I am skeptical that in the near future neural networks will be able to generate high-quality 3d animation without relying on physical simulations. We consider text-to-animation as a primary draft that we can clean, correct poses and physics – and get high-quality animation that the user can edit using our tools. I can't imagine how, without additional control, you can get the necessary result from the text alone, except in the most trivial cases.

If you add video neuro rendering to this, which will become possible sooner or later, then the tool turns out to be quite magical. You describe the idea in your own words, get a realistic enough version, edit it and at the output, you have a ready-made video with the right character in any style. But so far, this is all a concept, and implementation is still far away.

https://preview.redd.it/h6rgfzri2l4b1.png?width=1270&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2071b8318f7c57f0ff5d9c530929ce3dfe9c69dd

**Cascadeur itself was built on the basis of neural networks.In other words, you have been in this topic for a long time.** **However, have you used them only as part of training your service?** **Or have you experimented with it somewhere (in other areas)?**

**Eugene -**  First of all, I want to note that so far, there are more physics in Cascadeur than neural networks, and this is the main difference from most of the solutions we know for generating animation. We started using neural networks a few years ago and achieved the greatest success in the AutoPosing tool, which helps to make a natural pose with the least amount of user actions.

If we talk about our company Nekki as a whole, neural networks have been used in other projects for different tasks. As an example, I can name the bots in Shadow Fight 4: Arena. They have been trained with real player battle recordings and are able to control different characters using their special techniques and tactics characteristic of these characters.

**Many animations in Cascadeur are done like this: a video clip is loaded into the program as a template, according to which the animator reproduces key frames.** **How realistic is it within the framework of your service to implement a model that will be ready to make a draft animation based on video alone?** **Are you working in this direction?**

**Eugene -**  Yes, we are working on it - it's something like a video mocap. Already in the version 2023.1 of Cascadeur there will be the first alpha version of this feature. It is not yet possible to achieve perfect quality, but as a reference animation draft, in which there are at least key poses and timings, this can save a lot of time. We will further develop and optimize this feature. It works slowly on the client computer, so in the long run, we need to transfer it to the server – then we will be less limited by the user's hardware performance.

**Back to business: now people are saying that investors want to invest like crazy in AI.** **Have you had that experience?** **What are these investors waiting for? And do they understand that they are essentially competing with Microsoft, Google and Adobe in this space?**

**Eugene -**  I think there is no competition here with such giants. Large companies invest in the technology itself, and small companies and startups try to use this technology in different areas. Even we don't develop our neural rendering or video mockup from scratch but use available libraries and models that we configure and retrain for our tasks. I have the impression that investment in such projects will now increase sharply. Cascadeur's development is fully funded by Nekki, but we are also open to proposals.

**By the way, did you expect such attention to neural networks that they received after the popularization of MJ, SD and ChatGPT?**

**Eugene-** A few years ago, we already understood that the future lies in neural networks and their implementation in various tools, so we began to recruit data scientists and engage in research and development of our tools in order to be ready for the coming revolution. But the successes of Midjourney and ChatGPT still surprised us and gave us new hopes and ideas like neural rendering, text-to-animation and others.

https://preview.redd.it/1om6oslk2l4b1.png?width=1270&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=518d01958c55b4189db09dac651af1ff3be04586

**Are you ready to make a prediction?** **What can be expected in the context of AI technologies, including your own, at least until the end of the year**

**Eugene -**  I think that the world and the market will not change as quickly as many people fear, but most importantly, investments will change, which reflects the belief in a certain future... In the coming year, I expect to see the emergence of intelligent search and a change in the approach to tutorials - soon, people will be able to receive personalized help and instructions for their tasks. Generative networks will help to prototype and try different ideas faster, but in most cases, they will not be able to produce the final result. 

As far as we're concerned, we think of AI as an assistant that speeds up the work of an animator who knows what he wants. Motion detection based on reference, autoposing, autophysics, neurorendering - all of these are primarily designed to shorten the time between the idea and the result, but at every stage, the animator has full control and can make any changes. I think that by the end of the year, we will already be able to introduce new AI features.

**And two technical questions: when I familiarized myself with the limitations of the free version, I found that the user can only export models with ""300 images and 120 joints"".** **For those who are not familiar with the animation, explain how much is it?**

**Eugene -**  The idea behind the restrictions is to allow amateurs and indie developers to use Cascadeur for free without sacrificing important features.300 frames at 30 frames per second is 10 seconds. That's more than enough for game animations, but not enough for long cutscenes. Also, 120 points is enough for almost any character, but not enough for multiple characters or for very fancy characters. .

**When can we expect Godot support?**

**Eugene -**  We will do that after we add support for glTF format and USD format. We are already working on this.Took from [Cascadeur.com](https://Cascadeur.com)"

Hey fellow stressed-out college applicants! Are you tired of the same old boring advice on how to get into your dream school? Well, look no further! Strap in for the wildest ride of your academic life as we present the ultimate shitpost guide to college applications.

Step 1: Choose Your Spirit Animal Before embarking on this daunting journey, it's essential to select your spirit animal. Is it the procrastinating panda? The caffeinated squirrel? Whatever it may be, channel its energy whenever you need that extra boost of motivation (or lack thereof).

Step 2: Create the Perfect College List It's time to compile your college list, but forget about rankings and reputation for a moment. Let's base your choices on the critical factors: food, proximity to pizza places, and the quality of Wi-Fi. Trust us; these factors will play a significant role in your academic success.

Step 3: Ace the Essay with Dank Memes Writing college essays doesn't have to be a dreadful task. Infuse your masterpiece with the finest memes from the depths of the internet. Nothing says ""intellectual prowess"" like a well-placed Shrek reference or a SpongeBob quote. Remember, originality is key!

Step 4: Secret Weapon - The Recommendation Letter Time to leverage those relationships! Ensure your teachers write the most epic recommendation letters on your behalf. Bribery? Not necessary! Just leave a subtle trail of glitter and confetti wherever you go. They'll get the hint.

Step 5: The Extracurricular Odyssey Now, here's the secret sauce for extracurricular success: join every club imaginable. From underwater basket weaving to extraterrestrial poetry recitals, show that you're a master multitasker. Colleges love to see a student who can balance the cosmic forces of life.

Step 6: Interviews, The True Litmus Test Interviews can be intimidating, but fear not! Employ the power of memes during your interview. If you feel stuck, whip out a picture of a bewildered cat or a llama wearing sunglasses. It's guaranteed to break the ice, leaving your interviewer in awe of your brilliance.

Step 7: Waiting for the Decision As you wait for the fateful day, refresh your email inbox every 0.5 seconds. Surround yourself with good luck charms like four-leaf clovers, rabbit's feet, and maybe even a lucky pair of socks. Remember, superstition is the key to success!

Disclaimer: This guide is 100% satirical and not recommended for serious college applications. Please consult REAL advice from professionals and trusted sources.

So, there you have it, aspiring college applicants! Follow these steps religiously (or not), and who knows? Maybe you'll be accepted into the prestigious University of Memeology! Good luck, and may the memes be ever in your favor. "
143qz35,1,2023-06-07,"Kids and AI: Pros, Cons + Tips",u/husseinyahfoufi,OpenAI,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/143qz35/kids_and_ai_pros_cons_tips/,"ChatGPT is less than a year old, and already, there are many of us that rely on it every day for our jobs, businesses, and careers. I've been thinking about what this means for my kids, who will grow up not knowing a world pre-AI.

The full breakdown of these thoughts is posted [right here](https://www.gpthacks.com/p/kids-and-ai-safe-or-scary), but all points are included below for discussion as well.

**AI Opportunities for Children**

* **Enhanced Learning:** ChatGPT (and other AIs) can be an incredible tool for kids to learn with. It can help break down very complex concepts, directly answer questions and avoid the tedious and sometimes dangerous task of sifting through endless search results to find an answer or source they can use.
* **Personalized Learning:** AI can tailor responses based on each individual student's needs and preferences. It doesn't need to give a generic answer to everyone that is exactly the same. Just imagine having calculus explained to you in a way that works for your brain or with problem examples in your field of interest.
* **Language Learning & Communication Skills:** Interacting with an AI bot can improve language proficiency and communication skills. To get the most out of an AI, you have to learn to prompt better, aka ask better questions and provide more context. This is a critical skill that can help in all walks of life.
* **Creativity Expression:** generative AI that creates music, images, and videos can spark creativity in kids' minds by letting them experiment in artistic domains and help them push their boundaries and imagination of what is possible.
* **Interactive Learning Experiences:** By marrying AI with virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), immersive, hands-on learning experiences can be created. I can't wait to see what generative AI will look like in Apple's new Vision Pro.
* **STEM Education:** AI can help develop critical thinking through simulations and problem-solving activities, and it can help in data analysis and computational modeling.

However, just like with all technology, AI is a double-edged sword and there are some risks worth noting.

**AI Risks for Children**

* **Decreased Critical Thinking & Problem-Solving:** If kids start to rely excessively on AI, it may hamper the development of independent thinking and problem-solving skills.
* **Bias:** AI models like ChatGPT and Bard learn from the internet, and as a result, they carry the biases present in their training data. When kids interact with AI, they may encounter these skewed perspectives without knowing it.
* **Interpretability:** AI models are a bit of a ""black box,"" they make complex decisions that are difficult to understand without giving many details on sources, which raises concerns about transparency and accountability.
* **Inaccurate Information (Hallucinations):** Large language models strive to sound believable rather than accurate, which could expose kids to misinformation.
* **Social Isolation:** Kids might spend too much time with AI, compromising their social and emotional development.
* **Psychological Impact:** Kids may form emotional attachments or have unrealistic expectations from the AIs they use.
* **Privacy & Safety Issues:** Kids might inadvertently disclose sensitive data while interacting with AI systems, which could cause privacy risks.

So, given these opportunities and risks, how should parents navigate this AI world?

**Parenting Tips for an AI World**

* **Promote Digital Literacy:** Teach your kids about online safety, privacy, and how to be a good digital citizen.
* **Set Boundaries:** Establish clear rules about AI tool usage, and also include screen-time limits.
* **Keep the Conversation Open:** Make sure your kids are comfortable discussing their AI interactions with you.
* **Encourage Fact-Checking:** Teach kids to confirm the information they receive from AI.

By setting a positive example and giving good guidance, we can make sure our kids benefit from AI in a secure and advantageous way.

**P.S.** If you find this breakdown and tips beneficial, there's more in this [free newsletter](https://www.gpthacks.com) that shares tips and insights on how to best use AI to grow your business and boost your career."
1442mjx,4,2023-06-08,Thank you ChatGPT,u/Hynosaur,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1442mjx/thank_you_chatgpt/,"I teach English as a second language in a Scandinavian country - 8th and 9th grade.

They HATE grammar, and the learning portals we have at school lack good grammar assignments, the variation is poor so of course my students hate them.

But now, both my 8th graders look forward to next years English classes and the "" when you are done, here are grammar stuff for you to enjoy""

I made my students (50) tell me what they live, have as a hobby, what would be fun as a grammar theme.

One of my students joked and said ""My Little Pony"" the. One said ""Phineas and Ferb"" and they all got excited.
Examples:

Pasta and pesto
Sports cars
Star Trek
Donald Trump
Teletubbies 

They do not know how Hahaha... But

That I will be making them grammar assignments in 3 levels for the entire 9th grade on verbs, propositions, adverbs etc on their theme of choice.

I will use ChatGPT... And then make the print out folders with pictures ( hey...  The My Little Pony student has no idea who Apple Jack is.. but he will learn )

...

Seriously I have a tool that makes my students excited about grammar .. would be a fool not to use that.
It is better than coke and ice cream"
1445zzp,24,2023-06-08,How can I teach AI in my classroom?,u/mimifaie7a,OpenAI,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1445zzp/how_can_i_teach_ai_in_my_classroom/,"I'm a teacher working with a group of 7-9 year old students, and I have an exciting vision for our classroom. I want to introduce them to the world of AI and prompt engineering, but I need your guidance and suggestions!

I recently heard that prompt engineering is the future, and I believe it's crucial for my students to start thinking about AI as a powerful tool that they will use in their future.

I've been considering of using ChatGPT and Midjourney to start playing with them creating books, art, lyrics... and make it interactive.

I've also seen a book called ""Machine Learning for Kids"" but i'm not sure if should I suggest it or not, cause i didn't read it yet, any recommendations for books here?

I also checked many videos on youtube and I found a couple of channels that can be interesting like ""Peekaboo Kidz"", do you know some that can be good as well?

Someone also recommended me a monthly subscription (for their parents obviously) that offers gadgets for kids to build, and some of these gadgets can be connected to ChatGPT, this one is called ""Circuitmess"", is there any other brand that is doing the same that I can check?

What other tools, resources, or activities do you think would be useful in teaching AI to them?

Thank you in advance :)"

&#x200B;

I am building a community of social/data/computer scientists at the University of Mannheim focused on applications and theory of Large Language Models.  The community will be working to make contributions along research, teaching, and enterpreneurial dimensions.  The positions can be at the graduate student, pre-doc (ABD), or post-doc level.  The details for the call are coming, but given the impending summer, I wanted to get an initial announcement out.  

&#x200B;

I am looking for the right people at least as much as the right skills: people  open to providing and receiving feedback, supporting others, and who is committed and looking to grow intellectually.  The more experience with the relevant coding (Python, HuggingFace), mathematical statistics, algorithms, and applied work in the social sciences, the better.  We will have our own infrastructure, so experience setting up and running servers will be a big plus.  

&#x200B;

A formal announcement will follow, but the position will be at the E13 level.   Teaching requirements will depend on the level and skills of the applicant, but will be tied directly to your research interests.  Salary is competitive, and will be at the standard E13 level as set by the state of Baden-Württemberg.

&#x200B;

If you have any questions, please send them to [MarcRatkovic@gmail.com](mailto:MarcRatkovic@gmail.com).  When you reach out, it would help if you would include a CV and any relevant working papers (at any stage of development).

144fm8s,228,2023-06-08,"Dear Men, If Fixing Your Profile Hasn't Helped, Read This.",u/DidiHelpMePliss,IndianBoysOnTinder,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianBoysOnTinder/comments/144fm8s/dear_men_if_fixing_your_profile_hasnt_helped_read/,"**OK, time to sit up straight because I am going to spill some tough love on the men in the community.**

This is regarding online dating. This is supposed to serve as a compass for you to navigate yourself correctly through the journey.

This piece is based on **three things:**

\- My own experience with online dating.

\- Insights uncovered while helping three cis-gendered, male friends with their dating-app profiles to understand the 'why'(s) and 'how'(s) of Communication and Perception in dating.

\- Over a decade of being a Communication and Strategy professional in the corporate sector.

&#x200B;

(However, if you use dating apps for one-night stands and casual relationships, you can stop here. This post may end up wasting your time.)

&#x200B;

1) **First of all** — treat yourself like a 'product' and position yourself accordingly in the market.

Take time to:

\- Understand your **SWOT**.

\- Understand your **competitor** (it is not who you think it is).

\- Understand your **consumer**.

I will elaborate on each one of these later.

&#x200B;

2) **Understand your SWOT:**

SWOT stands for Strength, Weakness, Opportunity, and Threat.

Map it out for yourself, and then...

**Work on actually having a personality.**

**What does** ***not*** **count as 'Personality'?**

Going to the gym is not your whole personality.

Your bike/car, or your love for them cannot be your whole personality.

Your height, colour of your eyes etc are not your personality. 

Bladerunner/RPG is not your whole personality.

F.R.I.E.N.D.S. cannot be your whole personality.

**And your job, definitely, is not your whole personality.**

Therefore, when you put 3 out of 5 pictures from your gym, it puts you in a very crowded room that is jam-packed with other gym-goers, lumping your whole personality as a **'Gym Bro'**.

When you lack personality, then it is not that you aren't 6'3"" tall and hence women aren't choosing you. Learn to see things for what they are. 

**Ok, but what** ***is*** **Personality then?**

**Personality is a combination of goals, fears, aspirations, dreams, hopes, likes, dislikes, beliefs etc** — **attributes that make you 'you'.**

Capitalize on each one of these. 

**Learn to leverage even your weakness by leaning into it.**

For example, if you are a guy who is not a fan of English language, and can't for the life of you understand why people don't speak in Hindi, then why are you writing your profile in English, and slogging your posterior off to attract a Starbucks-sipping chica who *may* not value what you bring to the table?

Instead, channel your inner Harishankar Parsai and write your profile in Hindi.

When you do that, you will have automatically sifted out anyone who is judgmental about your preferred language, and in fact, you may end up attracting someone who will help you paint the town red over this shared interest!

**So, keeping everything aside, understand who you are. The better you understand yourself, the easier the dynamics are going to be.**

&#x200B;

3) **Learn. To. Write. Sentences.**

Complete sentences. With commas, em dashes, and colons.

Do not put five pictures on your profile with one or two words answers to prompts. Learn to put together coherent thoughts.

It shows your ability to express yourself.

Also, expressing yourself is cool.

**Stoicism is fine** but Zeno of Citium and Marcus Aurelius did not have to spend their life getting left-swiped in the era that is striving to ensure gender equality. Nor were they fighting battles in a hyper-individualistic world.

They had armies to keep them together. Remember this.

&#x200B;

>Language was invented for one reason, boys--- to woo women---and in that endeavor, laziness will not do.  
>  
>Dead Poet Society

&#x200B;

4) **Re-evaluate your brand-messaging. (Understand your** **consumer)**

Do all/most of your pictures have you posing next to a Merc/BMW etc, and then you cry about attracting gold-diggers?

**If you are not looking to attract gold-diggers,** tell us what do you bring to the table? Do you have skills required for 'adulting' like keeping a house, planning a meal and ordering for grocery? Do you know basic cooking? If your mom (or someone else) does it all for you, pause dating for a while and contribute to unpaid efforts that go in keeping you alive.

**What does it do, you ask?**

It softens rough edges of your personality, develops emotional maturity and an ability to estimate and take on the impact of silent mental load.   
It gives you something real to talk about.   
It gives the other person something relatable to benchmark you against.

**Relationships are much more than booking OYO for a few hours.**

(There is a reason your cool collection of Legos cannot be a part of this 'what you bring to the table' exercise. I will explain it later.)  
**Assess if you actually have a personality or are you a humanoid who can code (or whatever else it is that you do), and otherwise bring very little to the table.**

&#x200B;

5) **Speaking of Gold Diggers...**

Some of you men disintegrate and combust into flames the minute a girl tells you that she is looking for someone who is better off financially (or has a benchmark that requires money). 

**Why?**

Do *you* not switch your job for better prospects? 

Do *you* not look for someone way hotter/prettier/ smarter than you are?

How are women not allowed to have a richer partner? Please explain. 

(I am not asking whether she is a student, banking on dad's money, or hustling at work herself in this case. It does not matter. If you have a wishlist, she too has one. Can you match up? No? Move on then. What is the logic behind becoming bitter about it?) 

&#x200B;

6) **To attract the right mate, you need to become the right mate.**

For some weird reason, one of the friends I was helping said something that meant something like **he will straighten up for the right girl.** 

Bro, what.

**This is not how it works.** It, in fact, works the other way round. 

You focus on becoming the right person and that takes you one step closer to finding 'the one'. If you are a mess when the right one comes along, they are likely to walk right past you. 

  
You dress up and *then* go to the bus-stop, wait for the right bus, and board it when it reaches the bus-stop you are at. You don't show up at the bus stop nude and start dressing up the minute your bus pulls up. 

&#x200B;

7) **""bUt dOn't wOMEn waNt eQuality?""**

They do.

Plus, nobody is trying to rip you off of the four pennies you have saved after 5 years of grind and hustle. Last of all women who have worked their \*ss off and fought centuries of patriarchy to get a seat at the table.

Women like to pay for their meals happily, at least the ones I know. However, there will be some who will expect you to foot the bill. **It is possible that she is looking for a mate who can afford to take her out for dates totally on his own.** She is well within her rights to have this expectation. And you are well within yours to refuse to meet it. 

**If such is the case, do not let this make you salty and call her a 'gold-digger'.**   


It is indicative of a poverty-mindset towards money. Instead, use it as marker to understand your relationship with money.

But that aside, if you cannot afford to take both of you out for a coffee/desserts date, **take a break from dating and work on your financial health first,** because it will keep you stressed and while you cry about having to pay for coffee, another dude would sweep her off her feet because...

*...most* women may not be looking for you to have 10 billion dollars in your bank account, but in case you both intend on getting married and having a family together, they have a right to assess if you can afford the fact that she can take some time off her work and look after herself (after the delivery) and the baby without your family getting driven to poverty. I understand Maternity leaves and all, but women's brains are prepared to deal with the worst, and they factor in everything and more, even if subconsciously. It contributes to them feeling 'safe' regarding the future.   
(Not all women, but many. And this is no sin.)  

*(I am talking about an average scenario. If you are a person whose dynamics worked out in a circumstance different from this, good for you. I have approximated this basis what my guy friends came across in the dating pool. This depends on the privileges, level of education, upbringing, mindset etc, and sometimes varies from person to person within the same family.)*

&#x200B;

8) **Speaking of Equality...**

... I hope your house-keeping, care-taking, and cooking skills are in alignment with the kind of contribution you are expecting from your partner in terms of finances. 

**Equality is not a one-way street.**   
And no, I 'let her' drink is not Equality. 

&#x200B;

9) **If you are looking for a one-night-stand,** state it upfront, the first thing. For some weird reason, the max amount of respect is garnered by guys who mention this right in the beginning. Or, better still, mention it on your profile itself, saves everyone the hassle.

&#x200B;

10) **Emotional Intelligence**

There will be m-a-n-y things, in life and on the internet, that you may not like. **If at all, this is where you need to practice Stoicism.**

Don't believe that there should be more genders than two?   
Cool, keep scrolling.

Don't understand what is this 'they/them' business in pronouns of individuals?   
No problem. Put forth your point in a civilized manner and move on.    
You don't have to dunk on people. 

See a 43-year-old unmarried woman asking for advice regarding her love-life?   
Do you have something constructive to contribute?   
No? Keep scrolling.

Some lady wore sleeveless to the office?   
Unless you have something positive to say, keep your opinion to yourself.

See a 63 YO 'aunty' on a dating app?   
Are you interested?   
No? Keep Swiping.

**Understand that the world does not need your permission exist.**   
**(Yes! I know! I am equally baffled!)**

&#x200B;

**Your inherent need to straighten the World does two horrible things to you:**

* You end up focusing on things that should be none of your business, thereby **adding no value to your own life.** At worst, you become an outdated version of your parents (who, by the way, might have still been relevant in their times) in a world that needs you to be hyper-agile in your mindset (and regarding your ability to change your opinion and understand the other person's perspective). But I understand that this may be quite a tall order for the majority of the people.

&#x200B;

* Every time you hyper-fixate on fixing things outside of you, **you lose the opportunity that could have either given you a better understanding of something you don't have the first-hand understanding of,** or helped you focus on yourself.

&#x200B;

**There is no magic wand to becoming an emotionally intelligent person. In the era of tech and ChatGPTs, your EQ is what will make you stand out. Period.**

&#x200B;

11) **Self-worth.**

Pause, and understand your worth, (or the lack of it). Don't just randomly hope to be swiped right by anyone. If you are marred by low self-worth, it reflects in every aspect of your life, including how you talk. Take a break from dating and work on your self-worth.

**Building self-worth is an inside job.**

There is a friend I have who is a Coder by the day and a Baker by the night. Once or twice every month, he invites us over for an evening of chilling around where we also get to sample the latest recipes of cake, quiches, pizzas, and breads he has tried. 

The dude is 35YO, the most zen person I know, has never had to be on dating apps because his hobby has everyone chasing him for recipes, 'let's bake together?' (s), ingredients etc.   
Not a one-night-stand sort of guy, so the street-cred works in his favor.   
When he dates, he sticks to a lady until things don't work out for whatever genuine reason there is. Once he and the lady part ways, both of them never bad-mouth each other. 

Take from that what you will. 

**Working on your self-worth is stacking up of favorable actions, one after the other.** There is no abra-ca-dabra to this. 

Also,

* **Refrain from becoming someone because of whom women have to close their DMs.** Over time, you will lose respect for yourself, and that happens very silently.

&#x200B;

* **There is a difference between speaking the truth and being harsh.** Your ability to learn the difference and the art will single-handedly be responsible for success in your profession as well as your personal life.

&#x200B;

* For some weird reason, a 25 YO man from a Western country is far more emotionally evolved as compared to an Indian man. That is one part of it. The other part of it is that most Indian men are so surrounded by their own type, that they r-e-a-l-l-y will have to break a lot of cycles to even fathom what is expected of them.   
**To break this cycle, educate yourself ruthlessly.**   
Accounts like [this](https://www.instagram.com/realzachthinkshare/reels/) may help you break the mould to some extent, but you will still need to break the cycle with respect to your surroundings. Hangout with men who see women in positive light. 

&#x200B;

* The women you are trying to woo, have their standards constantly reset by content from all over the world. You have to understand what you are up against.

&#x200B;

12) **Understand how Reticular Activating System works regarding attracting the right mate.**

Reticular Activating System is explained the best [here](https://youtu.be/wHup4N2_Wv0). 

And how to hack it is explained [here](https://youtu.be/xsrkOSTyWCU).

From Marketing and Communication stand-point, no brand spends h-o-u-r-s ridiculing and hating on the prospective consumer. Instead, they spare no efforts in getting to know their consumer and then tailoring their offerings to ensure that the consumer sticks around. 

**This is what I mean when I say know your Comsumer.** 

(Anyway, what is the point of hating on women throughout the day, and then crying here in the group at night asking for feedback on your dating profile to woo, drumrolls, those same women?)

When it comes to women, your competition is not another man. It is her peace of mind. **This is what I mean when I say 'know your Competitor'.** 

&#x200B;

13) **What makes dating difficult?**

Not the process.

**It is you hoping that it was easier.** 

But this is one aspect that demands ruthless growth. Just embrace the pain and hardships of getting left-swiped on and use it to upgrade your mindset and mentality. But all the while, be kind to yourself and know that you are doing your best. 

&#x200B;

14) **One last thing...**

**Analyze if any part of your childhood/teenage was chaotic or traumatic.** What we experience in our childhood, if left untreated, goes on to become our 'normal' in adulthood. 

**So, if you grew up in chaos, peace would seem boring to you.** You will constantly look for 'spark' instead of comfort and end up attracting damaged goods. 

If your childhood was not peaceful, it may be worthwhile to consider therapy. Therapy is good, it brings out the gunk of the soul that you did not know you were carrying around, all the while stinking because of it. 

If you are interested in understanding this better, read [Letting Go](https://amzn.to/3NiINR9) and [Attached](https://amzn.to/3qyOmlK).

**The thing is, you attract your tribe.**

If you are attracted to someone, *some*thing in them must have resonated with you. Surprisingly, many times, **it is the toxity that binds two people together.** 

**And toxity in oneself is the most difficult to accept.**

**To stop attracting damaged goods, you will have to heal yourself.** 

You will be surprised what a therapist can do. You may have to look around for a while before you chance upon a good one though.   
Twitter has two crowd-sourced list, in case you need: [List 1](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pzckT6ns2H1IlmwYwJa8EnBh_1u3gRA9cEOoA4zfilc/edit?usp=drivesdk), [List 2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uEeTDdu58z8nVLbBG8o1qY2xbOhlb9TRVx5COnw2ZiQ/edit?usp=drivesdk). 

&#x200B;

**Notice how I haven't touched upon topics like what you should write in your bio/profile or what you should message her** because these things are a direct manifestation of who you are. They can be 'manufactured' but only to some extent. **The mind games last only for so long.** After that, you *will* have to work on yourself. 

I hope this makes sense to some extent and someone. Take time to read this. I don't expect anyone of you to get all of it in one go. 

If you disagree, happy to hear your point of view. 

Thank you for reading! 

Have a lovely dating journey."

144l8hh,26,2023-06-08,I need a council of 13 Lesser Villains for a long-term campaign,u/saintsnnr,LongDistanceVillains,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistanceVillains/comments/144l8hh/i_need_a_council_of_13_lesser_villains_for_a/,"I'm beginning to form an online D&D campaign that will be run through discord and Roll20, for a campaign that I'm writing with ChatGPT. I am in need of 13 lesser villains that will play subordinate to my Headmaster villain. The campaign is set at Shadowfell Academy.

""The prestigious Shadowfell Academy, a renowned private school for the wealthy and powerful, located in a secluded castle atop a misty hill. The castle is a magnificent structure with towering spires, ivy-covered walls, and a sprawling campus that includes state-of-the-art facilities for both magical and mundane education.""

Players will enter the campaign either as a Level 1 Student, a Level 3 Staff Member, or a Level 5 Teacher. Students will be allowed to multi-class, as they learn from various teachers and receive quests from anyone on the Faculty or Staff. Teachers and Staff receive quests from the Headmaster, or his protege, and from the Council of 13, and can assign quests to each other at the direction of the Headmaster.

I've built lore, backstories, character stat blocks, and a budding Discord server for this campaign. Official game nights will be the first Saturday of every month, from 7pm-10pm PST (for nights when everyone needs to get together) but will primarily be done through text chat in character.

144v6t7,192,2023-06-09,Mark Zuckerberg on upcoming LLaMA v2,u/llamaShill,LocalLLaMA,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/144v6t7/mark_zuckerberg_on_upcoming_llama_v2/,"This comes from Lex Fridman's recent podcast with Mark Zuckerberg.

**Summary:**

* No news to announce yet but they're developing it and leaning toward open source.
* Crowdsourcing finetuning with the community has been considered, like a Wikipedia style way for the community to drive finetuning.
* WhatsApp will be integrated with future LLaMA versions. Metaverse and all future products will be underlied by AI language infrastructure.
* Mark sees a future of smaller LLMs covering each category instead of one major LLM like OpenAI. Smaller LLaMA models could be good for this.

**On LLaMA v1:**

>Mark: LLaMA is the language model that our research team made, and we did a limited open source release for it. For the first one, there were a bunch of questions around whether we should be releasing this commercially, so we kind of punched it on that for v1 of LLaMA and just it released it for research. We're working on the follow-up models for this and thinking through how exactly this should work for follow-on now that we've had time to work on a lot more of the safety and the pieces around that.  
>  
>I just kind of think that it would good if there were a lot of different folks who had the ability to build state of the art technology here and not just a small number of big companies. I just think that like there's all this innovation out there that people can create and I just think that we'll also learn a lot by seeing what the whole community of students, hackers, startups and different folks build with this, and that's kind of been how we've approached this.  
>  
>Lex: So for people who don't know, you did the limited release I think in February of this year of LLaMA, and it got quote unquote leaked, meaning like it's escaped the limited release aspect, but it was, you know, that was something you probably anticipated given that it's just released to researchers.  
>  
>Mark: We shared it with researchers, so yeah.  
>  
>Lex: It's just trying to make sure that there's like a slow release.  
>  
>Mark: Yeah.

**On the open source community:**

>Mark: I think it's been really neat to see. I mean there's been folks who are getting it to run on local devices, right, so if you're an individual who just wants to experiment with this at home, you probably don't have a large budget to get access to like a large amount of cloud compute, so getting it to run on your local laptop is pretty good, pretty relevant.  
>  
>I think that for the scale of what we're seeing now with AI, I think we're more likely to get to good alignment and good understanding of kind of what needs to do to work well by having it be open source, and that's something that I think is quite good to have out there and happening.  
>  
>I think that at least for the stage that we're at now, the equities balance strongly in my view towards doing this more openly. I think if you got something that was closer to superintelligence, then I think you'd have to discuss that more and think through that a lot more.

**On LLaMA v2:**

>Lex: You mentioned the next of LLaMA. What can you say about the next version of LLaMA?  
>  
>Mark: A lot of what we're doing is taking the first version which was primarily this research version and trying to now build a version that has all of the latest state of the art safety precautions built in. We're using some more data to train it from across our services, but a lot of the work that we're doing internally is really just focused on making sure that this is, you know, as aligned and responsible as possible.  
>  
>You'll have an assistant that you can talk to in WhatsApp. I think in the future, every creator will have kind of an AI agent that can kind of act on their behalf that their fans can talk to. I want to go get to the point where every small business basically has an AI agent that people can talk to to do commerce and customer support and things like that.   
>  
>So they're going to be all these different things, and LLaMA or the language model underlying this is basically going to be the engine that powers that. The reason to open source is that, as we did with the first version, is that it basically unlocks a lot of innovation in the ecosystem. We'll make our products better as well and it also gives us a lot of valuable feedback on security and safety which is important for making this good. I mean, the work that we're doing to advance the infrastructure, it's basically at this point taking it beyond a research project into something which is ready to be kind of core infrastructure not only for our own products but hopefully for a lot of other things out there too.  
>  
>Lex: Do you think that LLaMA or the language model underlying that version two will be open sourced?  
>  
>Mark: **I think the question is how to do it.** I think we did the research license for v1 and I think the big thing that we're thinking about is basically like what's the right way.  
>  
>People have tried a lot of different things, and we've tried a bunch of stuff internally, so we're making progress here but also we're able to learn from some of the best ideas in the community and I think we want to just continue pushing that forward.

**On OpenAI's large model:**

>Mark: We sort of believe in this more community oriented, more democratic approach to building out the products and technology around this. We don't think that's going to be the one true thing. We think that there should kind of be a lot of development.

&#x200B;

>I mean there's been folks who are getting it to run on local devices

What's the chances Mark has browsed this sub, or someone else at Meta? I think everyone should show their support for an open source LLaMA v2. Talk about it online, mention how it's helped you in real use cases, link this community, advocate for open research, and anything else to show support for a next generation open LLaMA."
144wewc,0,2023-06-09,Unpopular Opinions,u/sysilver,UCSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/144wewc/unpopular_opinions/,"Unpopular opinion 1: College is about advancing your career. It is no longer about being a well-rounded, renaissance person.

Useless GEs keep people from graduating early and/or focusing on more useful skills. Mandating useless classes disproportionately hurts lower income groups, but really just drives up the cost of college for everyone.

In light of ChatGPT, writing classes are especially useless. I understand that writing is an important skill, but 5 quarters of HUM amounts to about 25k when you factor in opportunity cost (assuming an 80k salary post-graduation). 35k if you're out-of-state. Don't even get me started on the language requirements.

[edit] Writing certainly is an important aspect of being able to think. That being the case, it is a skill that should be developed in high school and honed in college. A small number of people might analyze rhetorical devices in their career, but most will not. If writing is to be a requirement, it should be career-focused.

[edit] ""In light of,"" not ""In lieu of."" 

Unpopular opinion 2: Dining dollars are theft.

Imagine being forced to buy thousands of dollars worth of gift cards that you can only spend at specific restaurants. Sure, the restaurant employs people in need of a job, but other restaurants in the area have better pay. They'd love to move in and pay those people more, but they can't accept your gift cards...

Secondly, people who are working jobs for HDH are going to have to work for at least a hundred hours before offsetting the cost of their own dining dollars. Had they been able to just go buy more affordable food at target they'd probably be better off.



Unpopular opinion 3: The grad students were wrong. 

The grad students who petitioned for higher pay did so by holding undergraduate students' education hostage. They signed contracts saying that they would fill certain contractual duties, but then they neglected those duties mid-quarter.

While it may have been nice to have homework made optional and whatnot, the quality of education overall went down.

Lastly, without a budget increase, you're going to start seeing higher-income people get fired as funds get reallocated towards keeping on the necessary lower-income people. That is what you're seeing with some professors being fired.

Sure, you can argue that the budget should increase, but this translates to extracting more taxes from random people who are already struggling to make ends meet. Daddy coleslaw certainly isn't going to take a pay-decrease lol."
144ybjf,0,2023-06-09,I am attempting to learn Python while creating a mini-game,u/Young_Neji,learnpython,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/144ybjf/i_am_attempting_to_learn_python_while_creating_a/,"Hello!  
  
I am a rising second-year college student in Computer Engineering. I have a tiny bit of programming exercise with coding from taking a C course last semester. My career goal is to get into Machine Learning and I wanted to get familiar with Python before I thrust myself into Neural Networks. While learning the language, I decided to just jump headfirst into attempting to make a game. The user is able to create a hero and fight villains, level up, upgrade, and get stronger attacks. As of now, the game is just as simple as a turn-based simulator where the user and a villain take turns hitting each other with attacks.  
  
As I started with zero knowledge, I used chatGPT. Rather than having it write the code for me, I rather chose to have it guide me with very detailed descriptions of have parts of Python worked (Functions, loops, IO, and now starting GUI building).  
  
I like the way I am learning as I can actually see my progress being shown through different mechanics of my game.

Do you think this is a good personal project to work on? Could this be something that could go on my resume in the future? I really like using ChatGPT as it is more conversational than just watching a video or reading a book."

Recently, I found I got stuck in lack of Speaking English Skills, while in my opinion I did a good job at Reading and Listening. And as to writing, more practice in need, ChatGPT has taught me a lot luckily.

I have a little knowledge of German, basic grammars and some primary words. But I stop learning it for more than 2 years.

It will be my pleasure if someone reaches me for practicing either of them. My topic could be economy, law and any attractive news but not politics, which bring nothing but collisions. I love to play video games as well, like Stellaris and Hades. I'm also interested in some CS techs, like Linux, Shell, Python, Ruby... Just for fun, so math or other deeper knowledge may not fit me, but is welcomed, too.

I'm looking forward to voice chat. Messaging is fine. It's UTC+8 here, hope this won't be barriers between you and me.

DM please.

1452ith,4,2023-06-09,What to do?,u/Infinite_Party8846,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1452ith/what_to_do/,"In this semester, I wrote 5 lab reports by myself and I spent days for each of them. The thing is, my teachers say that a big portion of our class uses ChatGPT to write their reports. I asked them how do you detect the usage of ChatGPT and they responded by “simply asking ChatGPT if it wrote this text”. I don’t understand how they can trust the answer of ChatGPT since it answers the question by checking the genetal information in the text, not the exact text. I tested this method by putting one of my essays to ChatGPT and asking if it wrote this text. The answer was “Yes, I wrote this text.”, which was not the case. Now I’m worried about failing all my lab classes because of this situation. If I fail my class, what should I do? I know my teachers are looking for a cause to fail their students and the smallest suspicion may lead to an F in that class."
145h2ov,17,2023-06-09,ChatGPT has helped me a lot with job-hunting,u/Ordinary-Ask-3490,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/145h2ov/chatgpt_has_helped_me_a_lot_with_jobhunting/,"Hi! So last year, I was a senior in college trying to finish up my degree when I ran into some financial issues. Had only five classes left, but hardly any money to come by, so had to put a pause on going to college. I was really struggling - was stuck in retail and felt like I had no way out. 

Flash forward to the beginning of this year, I start hearing more about ChatGPT and didn't really think much of it. I thought it was more just a tool for students to use for writing essays. Man, was I wrong.

I decided to play around with it for the fun of it. Asked it many questions and was surprised by the detailed responses, I think the only thing it wasn't good at was math (but of course I fed it Cal 2 questions, so I figure it'll develop those skills soon). 

One thing led to another, I asked it to draft up a resume. Output was a simple resume. Then I prompted it to make a resume out of a specific job and its desired skills from job listings. It returned a really professional, accurate resume from the prompt (had to fix the formatting, but amazing!). 

Before this year, almost every job I applied to would give me no response. With the help of ChatGPT, I would send in my generated resume + a generated cover letter. Not only did I get more responses, but over the past few months I have taken 2 offers. Two is a low number, but it means so much to me in this case. Went from making $9/hr at my old retail job to almost $45k/yr at my new job doing sales support. 

Of course I had to fake it till I made it, but I've been learning the ins and outs along the way of my new job - with ChatGPT's help sometimes.

145poaf,10,2023-06-09,A nursing study of attendings making medical students print notes,u/VintageImages,medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/145poaf/a_nursing_study_of_attendings_making_medical/,"PICOT: population are the medical students printing progress notes. 
Intervention considered, hiding the paper from the attendings.  
Comparison alternative intervention, sending the medical student to find a Doppler instead.  
Outcome fewer medical students jam the printer and get hit with hammers. 
Time frame is until the nurses lose interest because a charge nurse got a nurse and a tech pregnant in the course of a week. 

Attendings carry dangerously long patient lists, because running an outpatient addiction clinic in Meth City beats working in a hospital  for a bunch of administrators with MBAs from Southeast Arkansas School of Business and Television Repair.  

As a consequence, the remaining attendings are busy making sure they have fulfilled 72 discrete administrative tasks and practices holistic medicine with all of their patients.  They are also responsible for an unknown number of residents.  Finally they are responsible for making sure the APRN knows the difference between levophed and labatilol, and why you can’t give either to a patient during an outpatient MRI.  

Many APRNs from the Hollywood Upstairs Online Graduate School of Nursing have trouble distinguishing between drugs that start with the same letter and will only prescribe drugs that start with the same letter each day of the week.  It’s a terrifying 26 day cycle, not unlike the time the attending had a pregnancy scare during their MCAT prep.  

As a result medical students on rotation are the absolute lowest priority.   The attending, however, has been instructed to find something for those little shits to do.  So the medical students are assigned the task of printing all of the progress notes for all of the patients on the attending’s list.  Inevitably the medical student jams the old as fuck printer. This is because the hospital is spending money on CRNA Appreciation Day’s golf outing and the medical student has not learned the ways of the the printer.  

Learning the ways of the printer is harder than learning how to do a radical neck resection to repair soft tissue cancers extending from the hard palate to the esophageal sphincter.  Micro stitching is much easer than applying 2.4 psi of  pressure with a slight anti-clockwise rotation of the head of the one specific plastic screw, with the rotation not to exceed 7 degrees or 0.04 pound feet of torque, which causes the printer to print without jamming. If done incorrectly this will cause the printer to smoke and the student will be hit with a hammer.   

Loss of a printer is inconvenient, because IT is in a Section 8 apartment in the housing projects across town.  The hospital used a janitor’s paystubs to get the apartment.  It’s very economical and the janitor and his family are allowed to live in the Provider’s Lounge.  IT takes approximately 4 days to make it to the unit and then has to order the parts from North Korea.   Every time someone needs to print, and can’t, a medical student gets hit with a hammer.   Hammer injuries don’t pay well, so administration wants to reduce the number of med students in the ED.  

The proposed intervention is hiding all of the paper.   The working theory is that if a pleasing nurse in Figs tells the attending that they are out of paper. Then the medical students will have to sit and watch an APRN try to perform a bedside neck resection on an awake and alert 43 year patient recovering from an ACL repair after a drunk pickeball injury.  

It is not going well. If a medical student tries to stop the neck resection, then they will be hit with a hammer.  APRNs are the future and if you make them mad, they will leave the hospital and go open their own clinic specializing in Botox and ketamine.  If you make an APRN sad, you will be hit with a hammer.   Just stay quiet and go along with the “no paper” story.   

Alternative intervention, a RN tells the attending that they don’t have time to doppler pulses on the fem-pop.  They are busy buying Figs and applying to CRNA school.  The attending will send the medical students to find a Doppler and then have them doppler the pulses.  This works because there are no dopplers left in the hospital.  They got lost in the bedding after a code and went to hospital laundry.  The administration wants to cut Doppler costs this year, so no replacements are available.   The fem-pop was unsuccessful, the foot turned blue, and it’s taken 4 more surgeries to repair - so many ICD-10 codes to enter.  

Sidebar: rumor is that next year administration is cutting EKG machine costs, because someone said a 3 lead is just as good.  The cardiology residents are already building their own EKG machines and testing them on forensic patients.  So far the machine works well, with only a small number of burns.  Unfortunately, these machines don’t read the EKG for them, but ChatGPT gives decently accurate reads.  

Back to the study.  I’m not sure if sidebars are allowed in APA 7th, but the APA 7th can suck my floridly psychotic patient’s left nut.

The medical students will spend their entire rotation finding the Doppler.  This prevents any medical student caused printer issues and subsequent hammer bearings. 

Proposed outcome.   Fewer medical students with poorly reimbursed hammer injuries and fewer problems with the federal government every time a package full of printer parts and a class-traitor’s hand arrives from North Korea.  

Time frame: at least a week or two.  It will probably get abandoned when news breaks that James the charge nurse has been pursuing chunky RNs and techs and missed the pull out.  

James knows that if the Figs are tight at the seams and she’s talking about getting a tattoo of her Pitbull that died of police gunfire after it attacked a school bus, then the panties are coming off after he buys them Applebees twice. Unfortunately James doesn’t know that the pullout method is ineffective, especially in the break room on the unit that’s closed for plumbing repair.  Anyway, he’s gotten two of them pregnant in the same week.  

The RNs have all been watching him try to gaslight the tech into believing that they’ve never actually had sex.  He’s simultaneously trying to get the nurse to pickup some extra shifts to pay for her own abortion and cover some staffing holes.  

Barbara the unit secretary figured it all out, because James, the tech, and the nurse all treat her like their work grandma.  

Unfortunately Barbara said that the tech has been gaslighted before and isn’t falling for it again.  Also the RN is a born again Christian and won’t get an abortion, wants her baby raised in a Christian household with a daddy, doesn’t know about the tech, and is straight fucking crazy.  

So the study will probably end when news breaks. Side benefit, everyone is picking up to see it happen, so staffing has improved.   

Statistical analysis: none, cause fuck statistics.

145vr86,175,2023-06-10,Why does Vijay have such a humongous fan following in Kerala?,u/Chad_Unni,MalayalamMovies,https://www.reddit.com/r/MalayalamMovies/comments/145vr86/why_does_vijay_have_such_a_humongous_fan/,"Okayyy, before we realize how Vijay has such a huge fan base in Kerala, you need to know about a trend that took place post 1990s.

Until the 1990s, Malayalees rarely watched Tamil movies and rarely Tamil movies got released in Kerala. Tamil Cinema prior to mid-1980s had a different movie culture. A very large percentage of its movies were based on Dravidian Nationalism. Whilst Dravidian Nationalism and Kerala’s Renaissance were similar in nature as both were deep-rooted in socialist values of egalitarianism, rejection of orthodoxy, etc.. Tamil Dravidian stories as such were irrelevant in Kerala because it was deeply rooted with Tamil myths as opposed to Kerala's milieu. You can asses it, watching some of the MGR's flicks. It shouldn't come as a surprise when Five CMs from Dravidian parties were actively involved in cinema either as actors or writers.

[Sivaji Ganesan's 1952 Film \\""Parasakthi\\"" was a 175 day theatrical run BO hit that made radical comments against caste system and glorified Dravidian Movement.](https://preview.redd.it/y87m4jhff55b1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ecafd74fd232c5842b6fa98d955ca7ef40a4872c)

However, late 1980s saw several newcomers in the Tamil industry, particularly the rise of trio directors- Balu Mahendra, Bharathiraja and K.Bhagyaraj. They changed the narrative styles of Tamil cinema by the late 1980s. Instead of many traditional rural and Dravidian themes, newer concepts like college based love stories, urban-themed subjects and subjects relevant to middle-class society started coming up. And some of them like Balu Mahendra was a popular filmmaker in Malayalam too. Thus he knew Malayalee sensibilities well.

This was the beginning of the amalgamation of Tamil movies into the Kerala society.

Movies like ""Moondram Pirai"" was welcomed grandly in Kerala because of it's universal theme but Malayalam industry wasn't affected as much because late 1980s and early 1990s was a golden age of Malayalam cinema. We were met with revolutionary directors, actors, stories, film techniques etc. However, it didn't last long when Malayalam industry started facing stagnation period which would dominate it from late 90s until the mid 2000s. That's why *Appuppan and The Boys* have perpetual content.

Anyway at the same time, Tamil cinema got a second major boost, post 1992 there was a rise of superhero-centric movies or city-centric movies. In this period more directors like K.S Ravi Kumar, Mani Ratnam, Shankar etc came up and double boosted the Tamil cinema with their extra-ordinary movies. Movies like Roja, Bombay, Baasha, Padayappa had pan Indian appeal and was accepted well in Kerala.

[Mani Ratnam's 1995 film \\""Bombay\\"" tells an urban inter-religious human relationship against the backdrop of religious tensions between Hindu and Muslim communities. ](https://preview.redd.it/48gbe3nth55b1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c0835aa67fbd0ab0498ef84ad8455a279dbf3d67)

Now, Why does this matter? Because Vijay, Surya, Allu or any non-malayalee actor for that matter, gaining clout in Kerala soil had it's bridge being setup much before their birth and is neither a result of their own nor something that happened out of the blue.

Before dwelling on the specifics of Vijay/Allu stardom, there are a couple of reasons that pulled Malayalees to Tamil movies. Lets analyse them  


1. Songs:

Malayalam industry hardly had any variety apart from melodious songs which was well rooted in Classical and semi-classical notes strictly following the 'ragas' conduct. We did not have much fast dance numbers or the ones that could be played during a fest etc. It was hard for the majority of Malayalee composers to think something not traditional. And our youngsters were frustrated from being unable to release their pent up energy.

That is when our Magnus Opus A.R Rahman attracted youngsters with songs like  Chikku bukku Rayile, Telephone Manipol, Mukkala Mukkabla, Gemini Gemini, etc from Tamil Industry. Our dhaaridhrayam for songs were so bad that we celebrated songs of absolute nonsensical movies. Jassie Gift was our only bragging right back then. Nillu Nillu Ente Neelakuyile, Themma Themmadi kaate being some of them. Other medium, where youngsters took solace in their teenage years were in Malayalam Album songs.

Even today, we lack good fast paced songs that is simple for every tongue to sing because our lyrics are too complex. For example, Thallumaala featured many songs that's tough on a foreign tongue, Kayamkulam Kochunni has an item dance sensation Norah Fatehi, and you all know how it sounds. However songs that are simple in lyrics and good music attract outsiders. The best example is Jimmiki Kammal, ollulleru from Ajagajantharam, kudukku from LAD, etc became a sensation outside Kerala. Kaduva's Pala Palli Thiruppalli is a peppy banger and belongs to repetitive song or refrain song genre. A quick internet search gives you the special factor about this genre.

Why songs are so relevant? Because songs brought people to the theatres. Up until pre-Jio revolution, it was the most successful way of marketing a movie. Now we've digital posters, teasers, trailers, interviews, PR shows, reviews, trailer's teaser and what not. Heck! Even today, you cannot discard the potency of video songs for theatre occupation. Arabic kuthu (Beast), Ponni Nadhi (PS-1) are some recent examples.

2. Next is Action performances:

Until the 1990s, Malayalam movies completely ignored the value of action sequences and rarely had any concept of superhero or macho heroism. Meanwhile Tamil movies created this genre and perfected it with stars like Rajinikanth, Arjunkumar, Sarath. This genre still continues with actors like Ajith, Karthi, Dhanush etc. attracting many youngsters, particularly boys and men to cinemas to enjoy such superheroism and action sequences. 

[Rajni's 1995 film \\""Muthu\\"" was dubbed in Japanese titled \\""Muthu Odoru Maharaja\\"" gaining him a cult-like status in Japan. Although a remake of 'Thenmavin Kombath', the screenplay was largely re-written to bring in machismo by adding new plot details and characters.](https://preview.redd.it/avz5ngi1l55b1.png?width=6150&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=dbd0bf0bd9fd5a28a065009dc8471848de74fcbb)

We also tried copying the genre and had both ups and downs. Shaji Kailas and Joshiy came at the top mastering this genre but when their films started saturating with similar themes, couple of the subsequent ones bombed at the Box office. Mohanlal, Dileep tried a bit of Rajinikanth in 2000s, only to end up losing BO and finally came back to their common man image. And its again this deficiency which helped Tamil movies. 

Youngsters wanted action hero movies which are still low in Malayalam, and Tamil movies filled that gap. Whereas such movies aren’t much patronized by *Malayalee families*. So there is no scope for making such movies in Malayalam. If at all if Malayalee audiences preferred these genres, it had to be rooted with Kerala culture. So you get Feudal stories like Aaram Thampuran, Devasuram which saw protagonists as larger than life. This helped both the sides of the weighing machine. Kerala culture and familiarity for the families and machoism for the youngsters.

3. Next is the MOST IMPORTANT REASON:

We had a dumb concept of classifying theatres into A, B, C classes where A Class theatres represented the traditional air-conditioned theatres in city centres which were called Releasing centres. The B and C class theatres were poor in facilities and hence were not given new releases at the time of the release. This concept existed because Class A theatre owners used to fund the production of the movies protecting their interest. So when a new Malayalam movie gets released it will be played only in A Class theatres for the first one or two months and then trickle down to the B and C.

[An old news report briefly mentions the releasing disparity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNsiCkUu4Ss)

Meanwhile, Tamil movies enjoyed wider release in Kerala irrespective of A or B or C class theatres. So, many B Class theatres played Tamil movies much longer until they get a new Malayalam release. So people in smaller towns, village areas patronized a lot of Tamil movies. This helped many to be familiar with such movies and enjoy it, which further fuelled more interest leading to the rise of Tamil movie stars fan clubs etc. It was only recently Malayalam industry broke this stupid ritual and embraced the wide releasing culture.

4. Language Barrier:

A good percentage of Tamil words are there in Malayalam vocabulary and are easy to understand, so they're mutually intelligible. However, there is an interesting aspect here, Malayalam has a lot of Sanskrit words and pronunciations even in causally spoken Malayalam. In addition, Malayalam has the highest number of loan words from other languages like Arabic, Japanese, Dutch, Chinese, Portuguese, Hebrew etc out of all the Indian languages. On contrary Tamil has least foreign languages influence in its local parlance. So did the influence of Sanskrit too. This makes Tamilians find it harder to understand Malayalam used in Malayalam movies, while Malayalees who have Tamil vocabulary in the Malayalam language find it easier to understand.

From Tamil, we jumped to Hindi, Telugu, Kannada, we crossed continents to watch movies. It became a socio-cultural zeitgeist for malayalee cinema-praanthanmaar. We weren't defensive about exposing ourselves to different languages and culture that is alien to us. There could be multiple reasons for it. My speculation says it's 'the diversity within our geography, the literacy rate, the limited media culture promoting Hindi through Dooradharshan channels and AIR. Speaking of this, I remember now a globally held filmmaker or someone highly regarded, mention a small place in India called Kerala has the most refined cinema audience. I'm unable to recall his/her name. Anyway....

5. Next is, Actors in the 80s and 90s:

Actors themselves were catalyst in fuelling our viewership of Tamil movies. A lot of the Malayalam actors have acted in Tamil cinema in both leading and side character roles. Mani Ratnam's celebrated movie ""Thalapathi""(1991), showcased Malayalam actors like Mammootty, Shobhana, Manoj K Jayan etc. This caught the eyes of many malayalees to engage with Tamil cinema. Kamal Hassan, Chiyaan Vikram, Rahman, Seema, Urvasi, Bhanupriya, Geetha, Ambika etc. have exchanged good amount of screen time in both the industry promoting the lopsided viewership. This trick is still employed by current gen directors like Lokesh Kanakaraj for wider market and talent factors.

[ \\""Thalapathi\\"" a 1991 Indian Tamil-language gangster drama film focused on a universal theme of \\""Friendship\\"" with an ensemble performers from Malayalam industry](https://preview.redd.it/1xhnj6upp55b1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a913ba36fcc2dafd0a1007b9c3a4d7645f2fa412)

6. Production value:

The current generation and our successors will be oblivious to a fact that once upon a time *cinema was nothing but magic*. Before tech for making a film was affordable, before the learning of a skillset was abundant , before millions in our country could alleviate themselves from poverty, before the globalization and the internet etc.. The concept of CINEMA was nothing short of a magic. Nobody knew and cared how it worked. You sit, the lights go off and you brace yourself for magic. You see few humans projected on a white screen and believe they're out of the ordinary. The transition from a mute Black&White frames, to B&W sound and to a colour encoded frames were witnessed with a sense of amusement in increasing degree.

[A beautiful article where the author recollects her days of watching a movie in a small town.](https://www.forbesindia.com/article/100-years-of-indian-cinema/watching-a-film-in-small-town-india/35085/1)

Well, this was how it was perceived by a large segment of audience in the initial inception of cinema but towards the 80s and 90s, the potency started wearing off because ""familiarity bred contempt"". In order to keep this suspension of disbelief that cinema once offered, Production houses started scaling up their projects with big budget.

This led to an extraordinary scale of production values that was unthinkable in Malayalam. Shankar's Jeans (1998) became a talk of the town because of [the song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wev3DcbjOIk) that was shot in seven wonders of the world as well as the massive use of VFX that was unheard of that time.

[Shankar's \\""Jeans\\"" filmed in & around the Pyramids of Giza - Egypt. ](https://preview.redd.it/yisj7i5wr55b1.png?width=639&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d397daa4d9870bb0e2104877fb7bc58cafc34ed1)

I'm not sure how much the younglings of this sub can relate to it. We are over exposed to new cultures and worldly experiences through other people's eyes/content in social media, that it has worn out the novelty factor associated to it. But for our predecessors vallapolum ulla big budget cinema was the only source, for this experience. [In order to familiarize this cultural gap, I recall this scene from Vettam where Mani's character is in awe over an Elevator that today's world take it for granted and is too mainstream](https://youtu.be/_PBC_j-Fix0?t=214). Something so silly but can provide valuable insights for an anthropologist.

Even today, many Tamil movies are patronized for watching something astonishing that we normally can’t see in Malayalam. Forget Tamil cinema, cinephiles everywhere adores commercial cinema with huge set pieces, explosions, destruction, exotic locations, VFX etc.

7. Media culture:

Sunnetwork, a mass media broadcasting company headquartered in Chennai, Tamil Nadu operated many prominent channels like Surya TV, Kiran TV which aired a lot of Tamil movies and songs pushing our affinity for Tamil movies. To a post 2000 malayalee generation, this media culture was a normalcy and so became Tamil movies.

8. Cultural exchange between Students.

Youth is the biggest consumer of cinema. How and why is a different topic on its own. Anyway, an exodus of students filled the surplus amount of institutes in Tamil Nadu, influencing their interest in Tamil cinema.

Combining all these relevant small and big factors, and them actors being at the right place, at the right time led to this humongous fandom. So, it was never completely about Malayalee audience ingratiating the star worship or it being a predicament of unemployment. Nevertheless, it must be a part of a bigger picture but never painted the whole canvas is my point.

Now let us try analysing few of the factors that put Vijay on a separate pedestal in Kerala's fan culture.

Firstly, Vijay's genetics. He may not be a Greek-God like figure but what he has is a next door boyish charm looks which is the actual selling point, alluding an impression that he's one of us. He has a ""rags to riches"" synonymous story (not exactly per se but in the initial stages he was dismissed on few differences) which helped even one of our PM for populism, even though the narrative is diluted.

Secondly, his over achieving skill sets. His graceful dancing skills hasn't faced a competition in so many decades, songs he has sung has been chartbusters, has great flexibility and athleticism for action performances etc.

Next is his Off screen persona and the most important factor here. Before I speak of this, I want you to understand a fact which brings a large audience for an in and out **mass masala films** (which is a personal umbrella term for me, for every commercial media across the world, from Hollywood's Superhero films to East Asia's Anime) and that is the ""Main character syndrome."" These mass films cater to this rudimentary feeling in each one of us. As we engage in such a film, the protagonist's real life identity cease to exist and we perceive ourselves on the screen going through all those challenges. Well, this is universal to every actors but in Vijay's case, this event is extended beyond his reel life.

He speaks very little in public spaces offering people to make their own assumptions of him (and when he does speak, it ends up as a sensational news). So he is what you think, which is again an extension of you. His humble and down to earth low public profile boosts his brand. Actors who realizes that mass superhero roles are a meagre gateway for a viewer's main character syndrome, will preserve their title for decades. This is why actors like Yash and Prabhas has maintained a low profile despite being at the helm for overexposure after their blockbusters. And the reason why social media stars are quickly forgotten. There's a name for this social adage that I can't recall at the moment.

And did I mention about production houses playing their active role in promoting their movies for larger audience in order to recoup their investment? They partner with leading distribution houses in Kerala and make huge promotions. So, even if an actor like Vijay refrained from growing his stardom, the big power houses would do it on his behalf owing to market sentiments.

Lastly, Vijay has decent acting chops and had a good career choices ranging from rom-com, action, drama, thriller. His 'Thulladha manavum thullum' and 'Kushi' still holds a special sentimental value among oldies and newbies. His teary eyed roles and humour timing hasn't been awkward as such. Otherwise malayalee audience wouldn't patronize an entertainment only packaged joker. It was post ""Ghilli"" that he stuck to a single dimensional superhero for cinebiz which after a decade of decent to good script is now showing signs of slowing down from repetitive theme.

[23 years of Vijay and Jyothika's \\""Kushi\\""](https://preview.redd.it/pklzi4ubt55b1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9b2d86c433992b9602b57385b5459c2fcdec2bd6)

So, these are the ones that I've observed and if you believe there's another major contributing factor, please pitch in. However, tribalist mentality among clubs and fans aren't the fundamental factor that established their presence in our pop culture but was merely a cherry on the top that cemented their position further deep because tribalist mentality is never about a person or an ideology but about one's own ego. The ego that my opinion can't be wrong.

In the coming years, if stars like DQ gain a total control over pan-Indian market, one mustn't hastily conclude it's all owed to his PR or his looks. It could be a contributing factor but the nuances leading to that status is far more oblivious to an average cinephile because it involves a lot of socio-political factors too. The same goes for an institution, a political party, a religion.....the nuances are huge and breaking it down to a single simple factor is a simpleton's way of thinking.

Last semester, I had several who clearly copied the question into ChatGPT and just submitted whatever answer it gave.

I’m not opposed to using ChatGPT at all. I use it myself. However, I would love to find ways to teach students to use it well. AI is clearly not going away and it is part of my responsibility to teach how to use it ethically and ensure they are still learning the material.

Does anyone have any suggestions for assignments that can embrace using AI? I’d love to hear any ideas you can think of, have heard someone else do, or have done yourself!

Thank you!

Has anyone else been watching this case as closely as I have? For personal context, I'm considered an aspiring educator and the last year I've been doing classes while subbing. I've seen what many of you have, the rise of the use of AI in an attempt to skirt research or studying for assignments given. Trying to get students to understand that the use of AI is a bad thing has been difficult. These are kids who don't realize Snapchat saves your posts even if they aren't visible to the public, let alone the damage wrought by AI usage if use as a substitute for actual work.

For the case itself, TL;DW a ~30 year veteran lawyer used ChatGPT to ""find"" reasons for his client's case to go to federal court, only for six of the cases to be fabricated by the AI. Now his job and license are on the line.

For me, this case might eventually become my go-to example for what happens if you use ChatGPT as a crutch for actual learning/research. But I'm curious about what you folks think of the case. Is there a better example out there that could be used?"

1468dam,207,2023-06-10,Increasing Voter Turnout is Our #1 Most Important Strike Action,u/OneDozenRoses1,nationalwomensstrike,https://www.reddit.com/r/nationalwomensstrike/comments/1468dam/increasing_voter_turnout_is_our_1_most_important/,"I am thrilled about this group of women organizing to Strike.  Women organizing is critical for us to advance.  I just want to ensure that everyone knows the importance of Democrats winning elections at ALL levels. (We are past the point of simply ""voting"", we need to ""get out the vote"" for others too.)  It is imperative that we win elections--or Republicans could easily make Striking illegal. Then where would we be?  In jail for Striking.

Getting laws in our favor is easier than cleaning up all these messes, and increasing voter turnout is the most effective use of our time.  If republicans win, they will pass even more voter suppression laws, and will turn us into Gilead for decades or more.

We need to ensure that Democrats win ALL elections (President+House+Senate) (State+Local+Judges+Schools Boards, etc.) so that the laws of the land are women-friendly. Voter turnout is crucial. Most young people would vote Democrat, but only 30% voted last time. We must reach the other 70%.

Here is an [Elections calendar - Ballotpedia](https://ballotpedia.org/Elections_calendar) so you can see the dates of each election in your area.

Since social media is, by far, the best way to reach young people to increase voter turnout, below are 20 ways to use it according to ChatGPT :

10 ways to use social media to increase voter turnout among young people:

1. Create engaging and informative content: Use social media platforms to create visually appealing and easily digestible content that educates young people about the importance of voting and provides them with relevant information about the electoral process.
2. Collaborate with influencers and popular figures: Partner with social media influencers, celebrities, and popular figures who have a significant following among young people. They can help spread the message about the importance of voting and encourage their audience to participate.
3. Run social media campaigns: Develop creative and impactful social media campaigns that focus on specific issues that resonate with young people. Use hashtags, challenges, and interactive elements to generate interest and encourage sharing among their peers.
4. Share personal stories and testimonials: Encourage young people to share their personal stories and experiences related to voting. This can help create a sense of community and inspire others to participate.
5. Provide voter registration assistance: Use social media to share resources and step-by-step guides on how to register to vote. Provide links to relevant websites or online registration forms to make the process as seamless as possible.
6. Host live Q&A sessions: Conduct live question-and-answer sessions on social media platforms, where young people can ask questions about the voting process, deadlines, and any concerns they may have. This direct interaction can help alleviate doubts and increase engagement.
7. Share voting reminders: Regularly post reminders about upcoming elections, registration deadlines, and early voting dates. Utilize eye-catching graphics or videos to grab attention and encourage young people to mark their calendars.
8. Encourage peer-to-peer sharing: Encourage young voters to share voting-related content with their friends and followers. Implement referral programs or incentives to further motivate them to spread the word and increase voter turnout among their peers.
9. Create interactive quizzes and polls: Use social media features like polls and quizzes to engage young people and test their knowledge about the voting process, candidates, or specific issues. This can make learning about voting more enjoyable and encourage participation.
10. Collaborate with student organizations and universities: Partner with student organizations, colleges, and universities to reach a larger audience of young people. Offer to conduct workshops, guest lectures, or online events to educate and engage students on the importance of voting.

Remember, while social media can be a powerful tool to increase voter turnout among young people, it's crucial to adhere to platform guidelines and policies, maintain transparency, and provide accurate information.

📷📷10 more waysChatGPT

Certainly! Here are 10 more ways to use social media to increase voter turnout among young people:

1. Create user-generated content campaigns: Encourage young people to create and share their own content related to voting. This can include videos, artwork, or personal testimonials. Host contests or giveaways to incentivize participation and increase engagement.
2. Utilize social media advertising: Leverage targeted social media advertising to reach young people who may not already be engaged in the political process. Use demographic filters to ensure your message reaches the desired audience.
3. Collaborate with grassroots organizations: Partner with local grassroots organizations that focus on civic engagement and voter turnout. Work together to amplify each other's messages and coordinate efforts to reach young people in the community.
4. Use storytelling techniques: Craft compelling narratives that connect voting to real-world issues and personal experiences. Share stories of young individuals who have made a difference through voting or highlight the impact of certain policies on their lives.
5. Host virtual town halls or debates: Organize virtual town halls or debates where young people can interact with candidates and ask questions directly. Stream these events live on social media platforms and encourage audience participation through comments or polls.
6. Provide voting resources in multiple languages: Reach out to diverse communities by creating and sharing voting resources in different languages. This can help break language barriers and ensure that all young people have access to vital information about the electoral process.
7. Foster online voter communities: Create online spaces, such as Facebook groups or subreddit communities, dedicated to discussing voting and related topics. Encourage young people to join these communities to share information, ask questions, and engage in meaningful conversations.
8. Collaborate with educational institutions: Partner with high schools, colleges, and universities to integrate voter education and registration into the curriculum. Offer virtual workshops or presentations to inform students about the importance of voting and provide them with the necessary resources.
9. Engage with local media outlets: Reach out to local newspapers, radio stations, and online news platforms that have a significant young audience. Offer to provide guest articles, interviews, or op-eds to raise awareness about voting and encourage participation.
10. Leverage social media analytics: Use social media analytics tools to track engagement, measure the impact of your campaigns, and identify trends and patterns in young people's behavior. This data can help you refine your strategies and target your efforts more effectively.

Remember, adapt your approach based on the social media platforms popular among young people, such as Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, and Twitter. Each platform has its unique features and user demographics, so tailoring your content and engagement strategies accordingly can yield better results."
146awjm,0,2023-06-10,Using ChatGPT for a good cause,u/Hatrct,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/146awjm/using_chatgpt_for_a_good_cause/,"**TL;DR: read the bold for the tl;dr: basically, use chatGPT to learn more about the eras/figures in bold.**

Unfortunately, meaningful study of history starts at the  undergraduate level. It is a shame that they don't teach this in high school, and it is a shame that the vast majority in undergrad  temporarily rote memorize the knowledge in their history and  history-related courses just to pass the exam and then forget it after,  especially because for most students these courses fall under electives. I already studied the below extensively in numerous courses in university and critically analyzed and connected the concepts across courses over 100s of hours, so I am picking a practical summary that you can use chatGPT to learn more about in less time.

**As  you read this post, remember that our neoliberal capitalist politicians  and bankers and CEOs, who are our leaders and run the country, barely  know any of the following knowledge. Even the most educated of them,  their education is limited to isolated narrow specializations like  economics (of capitalism) and modern law (which was shaped by many of  the incorrect thinkers/ideologies named below). Isn't it bizarre? How  can you run a country when you don't even understand the validity and  morality of the ideology and systems your rule is based on? Also, the  vast majority of the electorate is unfortunately largely unaware the  vast majority of the knowledge below.**

I highly recommend everybody to study world history since the beginning  of humanity around 200k years ago, and especially European history since  the 1500s, and try to see how everything logically connects in each  specific era: geography, art, technology, political philosophies/systems  (this will also make you realize that ""determinism"" makes more sense  than ""free will""). This would reduce ignorance and racism, and also shed  light on how the modern failure of a neoliberal capitalist system came  into place. If more people realized the incorrect pillars this system is  based on, they would be less likely to continuously vote for the  politicians who prop it up, and we can finally take a step toward  meaningful change, toward meaningfully fixing issues such as the economy  and environmental degradation and damage.

**I highly recommend you use ChatGPT to learn about the following periods/people:**

&#x200B;

**The Renaissance.**

**The Protestant Reformation.**

**The Scientific Revolution.**

**The  Age of Enlightenment.** (This one is particular useful in terms of  showing why we have the incorrect modern neoliberal capitalist system,  because the thinkers of this time erroneously thought that humans are  rational, which has been proven false by the modern literature. This  kind of thinking is what led to bizarre concepts such as US gun laws. **I  would also recommend you check out ""negative freedom/liberty"" vs  ""positive freedom/liberty"".**)

**As you learn about each era, you see how each one builds on each other. They are in chronological order.**

Some important figures (that modern neoliberal Western capitalism is built on) you can research:

**Thomas Hobbes**  (incorrect thinking: mistook his immediate environment as human nature;  this is where the modern incorrect capitalist notion of ""humans are  selfish and have unlimited greed"" comes from. no, humans are not  selfish, humans are built for self-preservation: this is NOT the same  thing as ""humans are naturally hardwired to accumulate unlimited wealth  that they can't even use while starving billions for it"". It depends on  the nature of the society, if society is built in a way that punishes  selfishness and rewards altruism, then in order to self-preserve, people  would have to show a degree of altruism. Modern capitalism mistakes  cause and effect: obviously, if the system you live in rewards  selfishness and punishes altruism, then people will have to act selfish  to self-preserve, this does not mean that this is ""human nature"".  Unlimited greed is not consistent with evolutionary theory and makes no  rational sense.)

**John Locke** (much  of the US constitution is based on his largely incorrect thinking,  people like Ted Cruz act consistent with his thinking; his ideas serve  the bedrock for the bizarre idea that ""a central state should not have  too much power otherwise it will automatically be corrupt""= but in  practice this lead to neoliberalism= the government becomes so weak that  corporations practically hijack it run it/use it solely for their own  benefit, which is even worse than an oppressive central state, because  corporations have absolutely 0 regard for humans and the environment,  whereas a central state would be motivated to please people at least a  little bit, even the worse dictators please their people to some degree  due to fear of being toppled, whereas corporations would literally let  the world burn for 1 cent more profit)

**John Stuart Mill** (mostly good thinking)

**Jean-Jacques Rousseau** (mostly good thinking)

The stuff in parentheses above is my interpretation/opinion based on thinking about this stuff critically for 100s of hours. You don't have to agree. I just hope you do your own research on these timelines/historical figures."
146dcbt,4,2023-06-10,"""Can ChatGPT also design a robot?"" wondered a PhD student from Delft. Yes, it can, and this is what it looks like.",u/AggravatingDriver559,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/146dcbt/can_chatgpt_also_design_a_robot_wondered_a_phd/,"An amazing article about researchers from the TU (Technical University) Delft, the Netherlands that developed a robot using ChatGPT. Source: [nrc.nl](https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2023/06/08/chatgpt-ontwerpt-tomatenplukrobot-a4166763#:~:text=De%20robot%20is%20door%20de,na%20lancering%20in%20november%202022.)

Text:

This is what a robot looks like when you ask ChatGPT to design one.

This tomato-picking robot consists of four large wheels, a box filled with electronics, and an ""arm"" with three ""joints"" to move in all directions. At the end of the arm, there is a hollow gripper lined with soft rubber to safely pluck the tomatoes from the plant.

ChatGPT only handled the conceptual work and was queried step by step by researchers from TU Delft and the Swiss technical university EPFL. The researchers assembled the robot themselves. They published their collaboration with the AI chatbot in Nature Machine Learning on Thursday.

ChatGPT has proven to be proficient in writing and programming since its launch in November 2022. Equipping a robot with a variant of ChatGPT enables it to interpret and express language better than ever. It is expected that Large Language Models (LLMs), of which ChatGPT is an example, will greatly impact robotics. The PhD student Francesco Stella from TU Delft and his colleagues wanted to know if this kind of AI could also design a robot.

It was remarkable to serve as the ""executor"" of the computer this time. Firstly, they asked ChatGPT about the future challenges humanity faces. The answer was food supply, aging, and climate change. The researchers decided to focus their robot on food supply. How can robotics help in this regard? Harvesting, pest control, and packaging, suggested ChatGPT, and the researchers chose harvesting.

Shapes and materials
The questions posed to ChatGPT became increasingly specialized. It provided suggestions for shapes and materials for the gripping hand and proposed a type of motor for propulsion. The roboticists asked the chatbot which of its suggestions it would choose itself, and they followed those recommendations, Stella explains over the phone. However, ChatGPT was unable to create design drawings.

In the publicly released chat history, it can be read that ChatGPT recommended adding cameras and sensors to determine the readiness of tomatoes for harvesting. The researchers did not pursue this suggestion, so the robot currently lacks this functionality.

""A chatbot can contribute a lot in the ideation phase. I know little about agriculture or neurobiology, but ChatGPT immediately recognizes opportunities for robotics in those areas,"" says Stella. ""This is also a risk. It tells me to focus on tomatoes, but I can't check the basis for that recommendation. Something may be statistically true, but practically different."" Stella finds the later-stage suggestions valuable as well and is now eager to delegate programming tasks to AI as much as possible.

Being the ""executor"" of the computer was a unique experience, says Stella. ""Designing robots is highly technological work, and this experiment shows that robotics is becoming more accessible to those with less formal education and expertise in other fields.""

Stella believes that the entire process of robot design could be automated in the near future. However, he does not think this will quickly lead to the autonomous production of ""killer robots."" Nonetheless, he emphasizes the need for thoughtfulness. ""This research once again demonstrates the extensive capabilities of LLMs. Regulations are necessary to prevent the misuse of AI."""

They've driven me insane, I have 3 gray hairs now that I did not have when I started and I have named them for my three troublemakers. Getting report cards done and all assessments done properly have been the most stressed I've been in years. I have been through hell with some of these kids, trying to get them identified, sorting through the drama llamas, etc.

And I'm going to miss them so damn much. Not just over the summer, but in general. While I will tentatively be returning to the school next year as building sub, it might not be for very long as I am hoping to be placed for student teaching soon. It might be in this same school, but it might not. 

Anyone else dealing with the blues?"

146g3w1,1,2023-06-10,Activity AI design,u/OrmeCreations,AustralianTeachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AustralianTeachers/comments/146g3w1/activity_ai_design/,"I had an idea for a hands on activity to teach my students the concept of variables in Python. I started to write it, then decided to see what chatgpt could do.

I was amazed at how effectively it turned my 2 line concept idea into a full fledged 60 minute lesson plan.  I won't need to change a thing to run this in my class.

I can't wait for the day where AI can set the tasks for students based on their level, then get their responses and check them for validity and give them feedback.  We are almost there. Like reading eggs or maths seeds, but with our own content."
146s190,72,2023-06-11,Increasing Voter Turnout is Our #1 Most Important Feminist Action,u/OneDozenRoses1,Feminism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/146s190/increasing_voter_turnout_is_our_1_most_important/," 

Since organizing is critical for women's advancement, we need to organize, organize, organize! 

I also want to ensure that everyone knows the importance of Democrats winning elections at ALL levels. (We are past the point of simply ""voting"", we need to ""get out the vote"" for others too.) It is imperative that we win elections--or the laws could get a lot worse for women.

Getting laws in our favor is easier than cleaning up all these messes, and increasing voter turnout is the most effective use of our time. If republicans win, they will pass even more voter suppression laws, and will turn us into Gilead for decades or more.

We need to ensure that Democrats win ALL elections (President+House+Senate) (State+Local+Judges+Schools Boards, etc.) so that the laws of the land are women-friendly. Voter turnout is crucial. Most young people would vote Democrat, but only 30% voted last time. We must reach the other 70%.

Here is an [Elections calendar - Ballotpedia](https://ballotpedia.org/Elections_calendar) so you can see the dates of each election in your area.

Learn how to register to vote at: [Voter registration | USAGov](https://www.usa.gov/voter-registration)

[Check Your Voter Registration Status - Vote.org](https://www.vote.org/am-i-registered-to-vote/) (to be sure you haven't been removed from the rolls).

Checked out [r/VoteDEM](https://www.reddit.com/r/VoteDEM/) and consider helping at [Home - Voters of Tomorrow](https://votersoftomorrow.org/) which focuses specifically on reaching young people.

Also helpful is this article showing how Wisconsin was so successful in April's Election to defeat an anti-choice judge (87% win). Amazing!

Since social media is, by far, the best way to reach young people to increase voter turnout, below are 20 ways to use it according to ChatGPT :

20 ways to use social media to increase voter turnout among young people:

1. Create engaging and informative content: Use social media platforms to create visually appealing and easily digestible content that educates young people about the importance of voting and provides them with relevant information about the electoral process.
2. Collaborate with influencers and popular figures: Partner with social media influencers, celebrities, and popular figures who have a significant following among young people. They can help spread the message about the importance of voting and encourage their audience to participate.
3. Run social media campaigns: Develop creative and impactful social media campaigns that focus on specific issues that resonate with young people. Use hashtags, challenges, and interactive elements to generate interest and encourage sharing among their peers.
4. Share personal stories and testimonials: Encourage young people to share their personal stories and experiences related to voting. This can help create a sense of community and inspire others to participate.
5. Provide voter registration assistance: Use social media to share resources and step-by-step guides on how to register to vote. Provide links to relevant websites or online registration forms to make the process as seamless as possible.
6. Host live Q&A sessions: Conduct live question-and-answer sessions on social media platforms, where young people can ask questions about the voting process, deadlines, and any concerns they may have. This direct interaction can help alleviate doubts and increase engagement.
7. Share voting reminders: Regularly post reminders about upcoming elections, registration deadlines, and early voting dates. Utilize eye-catching graphics or videos to grab attention and encourage young people to mark their calendars.
8. Encourage peer-to-peer sharing: Encourage young voters to share voting-related content with their friends and followers. Implement referral programs or incentives to further motivate them to spread the word and increase voter turnout among their peers.
9. Create interactive quizzes and polls: Use social media features like polls and quizzes to engage young people and test their knowledge about the voting process, candidates, or specific issues. This can make learning about voting more enjoyable and encourage participation.
10. Collaborate with student organizations and universities: Partner with student organizations, colleges, and universities to reach a larger audience of young people. Offer to conduct workshops, guest lectures, or online events to educate and engage students on the importance of voting.
11. Create user-generated content campaigns: Encourage young people to create and share their own content related to voting. This can include videos, artwork, or personal testimonials. Host contests or giveaways to incentivize participation and increase engagement.
12. Utilize social media advertising: Leverage targeted social media advertising to reach young people who may not already be engaged in the political process. Use demographic filters to ensure your message reaches the desired audience.
13. Collaborate with grassroots organizations: Partner with local grassroots organizations that focus on civic engagement and voter turnout. Work together to amplify each other's messages and coordinate efforts to reach young people in the community.
14. Use storytelling techniques: Craft compelling narratives that connect voting to real-world issues and personal experiences. Share stories of young individuals who have made a difference through voting or highlight the impact of certain policies on their lives.
15. Host virtual town halls or debates: Organize virtual town halls or debates where young people can interact with candidates and ask questions directly. Stream these events live on social media platforms and encourage audience participation through comments or polls.
16. Provide voting resources in multiple languages: Reach out to diverse communities by creating and sharing voting resources in different languages. This can help break language barriers and ensure that all young people have access to vital information about the electoral process.
17. Foster online voter communities: Create online spaces, such as Facebook groups or subreddit communities, dedicated to discussing voting and related topics. Encourage young people to join these communities to share information, ask questions, and engage in meaningful conversations.
18. Collaborate with educational institutions: Partner with high schools, colleges, and universities to integrate voter education and registration into the curriculum. Offer virtual workshops or presentations to inform students about the importance of voting and provide them with the necessary resources.
19. Engage with local media outlets: Reach out to local newspapers, radio stations, and online news platforms that have a significant young audience. Offer to provide guest articles, interviews, or op-eds to raise awareness about voting and encourage participation.
20. Leverage social media analytics: Use social media analytics tools to track engagement, measure the impact of your campaigns, and identify trends and patterns in young people's behavior. This data can help you refine your strategies and target your efforts more effectively."

>I trust you are all faring well amidst these protracted weeks. I must extend my sincerest apologies for my prolonged absence. Regrettably, I should not have left everyone in suspense during the collapse of the SVB. I must confess that I was not at my finest during those moments, as I foresaw the subsequent events, reminiscent of Bear Stearns's exit liquidity. However, dwelling on the past serves little purpose, for what has occurred is beyond our control.

>Now, many of you may be curious about my presence here. Wasn't I expected to return around 2028-29? Well, my esteemed folks, I have returned earlier because it seems that irrational exuberance has once again seized the collective consciousness. Animal spirits have reemerged from the abyss and permeated Wall Street. Suddenly, everyone is proclaiming, ""The money printer is back on!"" ""We're destined for astronomical gains!"" ""S&P $5000, here we come!"" ""There's bound to be an enormous MAMU ( Mother of all Meltups ) because everyone is bearish,"" and so on.

>Therefore, I pondered why not end my hiatus prematurely. Let us debunk the bullish sentiments and remind everyone that interest rates currently stand at 5.25%, not 0%. The government is not distributing stimulus checks; instead, it requests repayment through student loans. The treasury is also looking to replenish Tga this yr by around a trillion and there is this uncertainty over BOJ policy. Thus, instant economic recovery should not be anticipated. It is China, not the USA, that engages the money printer/lowering rates. A considerable portion of the population struggles to afford nutritious food with a solitary job, resorting to multiple employments merely to make ends meet. Virtually anyone earning less than $70,000 per annum lives paycheck to paycheck or dwells in their parents' basement. The current generation faces significant challenges in purchasing homes, among countless other reasons that we shall delve into as this series progresses.

&#x200B;

Ewwwww that was not what I was expecting. I just had to try it guys but wasn't it so cringe?  It didn't feel real and heart to heart. Therefore, expect still a language of an 8yr old from me. So without any further delay let's just get started.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Recap :**

Season 2 sucked! Yeah, I completely agree with you guys. I fucked up. Things got so complicated that I never really tried to update my original script. I was no longer relying on the new coming data but was just looking at things from the perspective as if it was early 2022. But it does not mean we should just move on. First, we need to learn from our mistakes, and yes by we mean I. So therefore let’s first take a quick detour that where did things go wrong.

I even took some profits off the table coz I forgot to book some in December leg down. But then due to the wrong assessment of financial markets, I deployed them early.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I think I have learned from my mistakes except the last one. Yes, I am a moron but I promise you guys that I will not repeat the above mistakes again. I hope we can build trust from here point on coz trust is all that we have. So let’s analyze things from a new perspective and let’s see what markets are trynna tell us.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Experiment :** 

**""Correlation coefficients on the monthly time frame""**

&#x200B;

In this experiment what we are going to do is first we are going to study the changes that are taking place across the whole asset class on a monthly scale. A lot of beliefs are going to change and people have to get used to these upcoming changes.

So let’s build a solid foundation from ground zero and see what possible moves can we play depending upon the incoming data. We will play the safest and most logical moves we know in times when we have our doubts about the coming data from not only the Chinese but the US government as well. Now some people like to say they are manipulating it but let’s just go with the data is lagging. The blame and accusations game is for the lawyers, media, politics, and social media. We are here to make a calculated bet. And if it pays off then I guess it was all worth it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So let’s just deep dive right in.

*-> a. Stock market vs Bond yields.*

&#x200B;

USA :

&#x200B;

[Weekly on the left vs Monthly Time frame on the right.](https://preview.redd.it/xiiyiv46fc5b1.png?width=1916&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=af9971f8ecc1f674951cd271de14c24f42277f89)

&#x200B;

The above graph is an SPX-US10y bond yield correlation graph. The green color indicates a +ve while orange indicates a -ve correlation. Higher green lines to the upside mean strongly +ve and higher red lines to the downside means strongly -ve. What +ve means is if SPX goes up then US10y goes up and they are +vely correlated. Always remember if US10y goes up then the price of bonds goes down. Hence stock price up and bond price down is a “Negative correlation” and this correlation is clearly visible on the R.H.S. i.e. monthly graph. There are lots of green colors lines indicating for the past 20yr we were living in this world of “Negative correlation” But then inflation happened and that’s why we are seeing those red lines emerging on the monthly time frame indicating for the past 2yr we have been in “Positive correlation” i.e. stocks and bonds price were selling off or going up together and that is why the usual 60-40 stocks and bonds allocation didn't work.

&#x200B;

But now as you can see from L.H.S. that things have changed on the weekly time frame. We are going back to the “Negative correlation” where the stock price is inversely proportional to the bond price i.e. bond yields are going up with stock price and vice versa. This correlation got triggered after the “Banking crisis” where we saw a little bit of resteepening of the curve and bond yields just crashed i.e. bond price went up but the stock price went down. It’s one of the chapters of the “Recession playbook” that many investors were looking to deploy myself included in 2H 2023 but things happened so quickly that no one saw it coming.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[A more clear picture of what is happening in the financial world](https://preview.redd.it/ut3ufwajic5b1.png?width=1797&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8fe7425d59263dd5c3bcb3b12ec07dd9256122c8)

&#x200B;

So what does this mean for us?

Well in a shorter time frame i.e. weekly and daily we have a “negative correlation” of the past 20yrs. What this means is people are optimistic right now that inflation is easily heading back down to 2% and that everything is going back to being normal.

As for a longer time frame i.e. monthly: “We are still in a strong Positive correlation” of something new that has never happened in our lifetime. So anyone trading after 1998 has never experienced this correlation in his lifetime. Now this is something a biased person would say. An unbiased person would say well if you open trading view CC things have started to slightly turn there on a monthly scale. That means this inflation is going to go away soon so in a year out you could have downside risk to inflation rather than upside risk which we had in 2022.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Japan & Germany :

So now what I did was I tried this not only for SPX but for other Index like FTSE, DAX, and NI225 vs bond yields. The results were a bit meh. Japan was lagging a bit. They still are not convinced and fully 100% onboard Titanic that we are going into another world hence the relation b/w stocks and bonds price is still ""Negatively correlated"" on a monthly scale. Ueda-san still needs more time to be absolutely convinced that this is not just a supply shock inflation but rather a structural inflation. Who knows maybe he is waiting for those red lines to emerge on a monthly scale coz that’s when a “Positive correlation” emerges in stock and bond prices. But tbh all the hard work goes to Abenomics. Things really turned around for Japan in 2012 when Shinzo Abe came back to the office.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Weekly on the left vs Monthly on the right in NKY-JP10y](https://preview.redd.it/pm6yts6jaf5b1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=63aaf5a5fd9bd6e0546022de88f5c0b92a580fcf)

&#x200B;

As for Germany, they are a bit ahead of the USA on weekly and lagging on the monthly time frame and believe in shorter time frames that inflation is about to go away soon. But why is that some of you may wonder? Well imo I think its coz of the 1% drop in the inflation rate from 7.1% to 6.1%. USA hasn't had that yet but it is coming in June CPI which releases in July. A drop from 4.1% to 3.1%.

&#x200B;

 

[Weekly on the left vs Monthly on the right in DAX-DE10y](https://preview.redd.it/ema33mz1nc5b1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=18d793a4256d4984299eb7f458859a11a866c472)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Result:  Inconclusive result.

We should not believe that inflation is gonna be structural nor should we assume inflation is ending soon which means you guys shouldn’t just go ahead and attach whatever multiple to a stock right now and cause multiple expansions in the index due to few stocks even when the Fed has said they will be H4L. Guys, we still don't know what to make of inflation after that July CPI which releases on Aug. What if after August inflation reaccelerates and goes for double digits by the end of the year or stays elevated high enough after touching 3.1% in July? I mean history has shown us inflation always comes in peaks and it has only happened 1/3 time that inflation straight went down to deflation due to Fed policy error. So if it happens this time around shouldn’t everyone be prepared for it? For those who don't know but in 1921 after the Spanish flu of 1918-1919 we had a Depression with -a 40% crash in DJI. If you are interested in reading more about it then there is only one Ecom book that's actually worth reading and I have already shared it with you guys if you read my past letters.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Trading view on monthly time frame indicates a reversal a soft landing or deflation coming while those above charts are kinda hinting that inflation is far from over and there could be a risk of second peak. ](https://preview.redd.it/h0txgc82fd5b1.png?width=1916&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=21e4b7e45207593e35e3ded41447875f76cacae9)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*->  b. Forex market vs Bond yields.*

&#x200B;

Eurusd-De10y :

&#x200B;

[Weekly on the left vs Monthly on the right](https://preview.redd.it/9zk3ov46fc5b1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9aa2129c73e7eb528877288c59d3e991496d86f1)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Now some people would argue that to study Europe you should consider France, Italy, and Spain as well. And don’t get me wrong they are right but you see I am not an expert and hence I don’t wanna overcomplicate stuff. Germany is the largest contributor to the European economy and so if Germany gets f’ed then I am hoping Europe will get f’ed as well. So what do we see here well not much tbh. It’s the same thing earlier in 2022 we saw red lines on monthly and weekly meaning -ve relation between Eurusd and De10y i.e. when Eurusd crashed then De10y went up meaning bonds sold off. But around  SVB we saw a +ve relation between Eurusd and De10y i.e. when Eurusd went up at this time then De10y went up as well meaning bonds still sold (This was a bit strange to me coz generally if there is a deflationary shock to the system it is the dollar that gets the bid regardless of where the system cracks wide open) The monthly also showed some signs that it wants to be +ve related but then got rejected. At this point many people will be bored and be like “What are you talking man” “I am more confused” and “Just tell me up or down” Guys just hold your damn horses I will eventually get there.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/837bge8zid5b1.png?width=1797&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=48b22313ac2a63b8f8620e0411ffb84d9fbb7383

&#x200B;

This is btw the daily time frame to express what I just said above. So what next is gonna happen as you can see from the relation graph is we were kinda in a +ve relation but then it's starting to go disappear and go back to being -ve related. Meaning Eurusd could make an H&S and break down while bond yields shoot up i.e. bond prices go down. But let’s not assume anything. It’s still not clear. We need more data.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

GbpUsd - Gb10y

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/uimr8w66fc5b1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1d07d7c65f14780cb15d87b378214bddbb6e6757

&#x200B;

So now let's look at Brits. Earlier in 2022 we saw a Pension fund crisis in the UK when Gbpusd fell and so did the bond price i.e. yields went up. Gbp-usd down and Gb10y up is -ve meaning that's why you saw those red lines till October. But since then as you can see from the weekly time frame we went up but we did not go up on monthly meaning the relation should still be very strongly -ve related but some slight signs of +ve relation must have been surely visible recently. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/36ui4x3bld5b1.png?width=1791&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2d7a5f201472a5322e293d76df53e2dba2de577a

&#x200B;

You can clearly see that -ve relation mostly and some slight signs of +ve but then it's mostly -ve due to strong monthly. Meaning inflation is still a huge problem in the UK and the recent data isn't helping. That's why daily has turned -ve.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

UsdJpy - Jp10y :

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/133gr356fc5b1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5a610a856b43b8f6f13532fc3ac5652670dcdde2

&#x200B;

Before talking about Japan I would remind you that it's Usd-Jpy and not Jpy-Usd. So be careful not to get confused. So as you can see from here monthly never even went for -ve relation but weekly went for it slightly in 2023 but came back fast. Meaning in 2022 they were strongly +ve due to strong inflation but in 2023 we must have seen some slight signs of -ve relation.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wq6c6oevmd5b1.png?width=1782&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3697119ebdb62b2974b478d1e2bc9e1028b6a45d

&#x200B;

This is so confusing on the daily time frame. Honestly, all credit goes to the Bank of Japan always fuckin up investors who try to short JGBs and always coming to the rescue of Yen by Fx intervention whenever it looks like the currency pair is gonna fly off. There are so many distortions here but I will try my best. In 2022 we have UsdJpy going up and JP10y flat at 25bps. But in 2023 we saw the YCC band being lifted to 50bps and UsdJpy pair down i.e. -ve related. The few signs of +ve relation returning we saw back in SVB collapse. Here everyone thought the USA was gonna collapse like in 2008. So everyone rushed in for the Yen safe haven and yields collapsed due to the risk of deflation.  Something is not adding up here. So let's just leave it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

DXY - Us 10y

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2fowy356fc5b1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f10f62d643d8c56504df1b7a7bf5310f3cfab067

&#x200B;

This is the only place that actually makes some sense. So as you can clearly see in 2022 we had green lines on both monthly and weekly which makes them +ve related. Meaning if Dxy went up then so did the Us10y. But that relation wanted to change somewhere around Q1 2023. We were heading down as you can clearly see from the weekly time frame but nothing happened and we just reverted back. Overall Dxy-Us10y wanted to be strongly +ve related and it is clearly visible how strong the relationship is as from the monthly time frame. So let’s check the daily time frame to show what I mean.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/r5xybeoxjc5b1.png?width=1483&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5e22a7875b298311d16e96733065a51c9f472645

&#x200B;

The relation is just perfect b/w Dxy and Us 10y which show signs of strongly +ve related.

&#x200B;

[Monthly time frame b\/w currencies and bond yields.](https://preview.redd.it/fpsy6cqxjc5b1.png?width=1621&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9af006387b0c80615490a12dffacac7e5ecea9ec)

&#x200B;

Now I know the charts aren't clear but please just bare with me on this one. The top left is your Eurusd, Top right is Gbpusd. The bottom left is your UsdJpy and on the bottom right we have Dxy. Then we have a correlation indicator on the bottom with bond yields i.e. US10y in orange, JP10y in pink, and finally EU10y in blue.

&#x200B;

Result: Only the United States shows signs of very strong +ve Dxy and Us 10y and that is all we care about. We can derive everything from just here.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Balance sheets: In own currency vs USD terms

&#x200B;

[Japan: Blue, USA: Orange, China: Yellow, Italy: Pink, Germany: Green, UK: Blue](https://preview.redd.it/qgyr0hoxjc5b1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a39fc0f202aa04f60a6c01929ddbe7ad64898ac0)

&#x200B;

As you can clearly see till October every CB’s were decreasing their balance sheet due to QT but ECB never said they were doing it in 2022. Also, an interesting thing to note is Japan. It is the only CB that actually decreased its balance sheet faster than anyone till 2020 times and were busy selling foreign reserves as USD was getting stronger and trying to defend the peg at 150. ( After this, I believe they bought $400B in debt again and flooded the global liquidity that Stan D. was talking about) 

Now some may argue the USA was the only one which was selling bonds while the rest of the were trying to inflate the debt away by running the economy hot enough. So maybe either this or there is some other mechanism to remove the debt away using fx pair which is out of my pay grade. They do so by making other entities absorb these bonds/mortgages from the CB balance sheet which rose sharply from 2020. Btw I tried testing it out using the JPY pair as well and not just the USD pair. One final thing, USA and JPY balance sheet seems to be running a mirror image so maybe they are working together to stop the recession through global collaboration like the USA exporting some parts of its inflation to Japan.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/f8nw1coxjc5b1.png?width=1828&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d7ddbc77e7c082b7bc41e571855b32685a268763

&#x200B;

Conclusion: However you look at it's not pretty clear that inflation is going away in developed countries. Japan is trying its best to import everyone's inflation. Fed, Boj, and Ecb are trying hard to export inflation. My bias of Stagflation still remains but okay there are some signs that from a monthly trading view, we are starting to see reversals i.e. inflation is going away. So let's analyze both perspectives.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Case 1: Deflationary spiral

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

|S.No|GDP|Inflation|Unemployment|Stock Market|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1.  June|Normal < 2.5%|< 4.1%|Whatever|Up|
|2.  July|< 1% Q3 Gdp|< 3.2%|Fed|Top|
|3. August|< 1% Q3 Gdp|< 1.1%|or|Down|
|4. September|< 1% Q3 Gdp|0.x %|Govt wants|Down a lot|
|5. October|\-ve Gdp|\-ve %|\> 4%|God knows|

&#x200B;

Currently, inflation is high :

&#x200B;

So, US10y - SPX: -ve  (Positively correlated stock and bond price )

DXY - Us 10y: +ve

&#x200B;

But soon inflation will go low :

So, US10y - SPX : will be +ve ( Negative correlated )

DXY - Us 10y: -ve

&#x200B;

This means that at some point inflation will turn into deflation ( Currently its disinflation) So equity risk premia will blow up. Us yields will go down -> Dxy will shoot up -> Stocks will go down eventually.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Time taken :

Normally it takes around 18 bars i.e. 546 days to go from one correlation to another on average and in my opinion it would take around 11 bars i.e. 336 days to see the bottom from here. So expect a crash like President Obama times in 2H 2024.  Now need I remind you this is a general theory and basically what you might have heard from recent interviews of Paul Tudor Jones and Drunckenmiller that they deploy this next yr when the fat pitch arrives. But recently I have seen this ""Inverse them bruh"" trend in the United States so I will not be surprised that it will play out starting July or August this yr considering the similarities to so many headlines we have been having this yr.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Case 2: ReInflation Trade of the Stagflation: ( My bias )

This trade can also begin early if you have inflation > 4.3% in June or > 3.4% in July. So Top will shift further early.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

|S.No|GDP|Inflation|Unemployment|Stock Market|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1.  June|Normal < 2.5%|< 4.1%|Whatever|Up|
|2.  July|< 1% Q3 Gdp|< 3.2%|Fed|Top|
|3. August|< 1% Q3 Gdp|\> 3.2%|or|Down|
|4. September|< 1% Q3 Gdp|\> August|Govt wants|Down a lot|
|5. October|God knows|God knows|\> 4%|God knows|

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Currently, inflation is high :

&#x200B;

So, US10y - SPX: -ve  ( Positively correlated stock and bond price )

DXY - Us 10y: +ve

&#x200B;

But then inflation will go higher :

So, US10y - SPX: will still be -ve ( Still Positively correlated )

DXY - Us 10y: still +ve

&#x200B;

Overall No change in correlation on a monthly scale. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Case 2a & 2b: What if inflation remains high and stubborn due to govt spending before the election?

&#x200B;

\- 2a) If inflation stays bounded in the range of 4-6% with rates at 5.x% and no recession with the Fed trynna cause financial repression I expect PE to be around 19-20 and all you're gonna up is due to nominal earnings going up 5% / yr. Current est 222 with E increasing 5% per yr you can do the math but in this environment trust me you don't wanna own an index but rather real hard assets like gold or a house. Or you can go pick specific stocks and generate alpha on the company making money or any narratives coz there will always be opportunities even in a bear market. Just look no further than my friend Jensen. He moonshot Nvidia many times inside a vicious bear market of 2001 where the Nasdaq fell -83%.

&#x200B;

\- 2b) Let’s say inflation goes for double digits starting July CPI on August then multiples get compressed to around 14-15 and earnings even with growing 5% nominal let's say 235-240 will be 15X240 min i.e. $3600 i.e. visiting Oct lows. So avoid overpriced tech and any stocks with crazy multiple handles.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Also, you guys know that I used Stagflation - High Unemployment theory to justify the crash but we never really got the unemployment thing we were looking for. Instead what happened was Stagflation's argument started to fade away. First Gdp started to grow and then inflation just went down w/o any increase in unemployment. This all looks soft landing tbh. But if let's say inflation rises again and be stubborn then Fed may have to do more i.e. take rates to 6% and that would finally break the jobs market alongside Gdp falling. Let's see if it happens or not.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So how to differentiate b/w these two opposing theories and why am I biased for more inflation?

Ans: Japan.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Japan loves the USA Positive correlation ( here -ve red ) world of stocks and bonds price. If Nikkei moons and rips higher expect an avg 4-6% inflation in the United States. If it is gonna be back to a USA Negative correlation  ( here +ve green ) world then expect USA exceptionalism once we get through the global recession part. Btw these are my own concepts so please correct me if I am wrong. I am a student of macro as well.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Where is the Butterfly effect theory that you promised?**

&#x200B;

Well folks you see it's like a long-shot theory. So basically I saw a P.H.D. level research paper by Riksbank which said that the USA is unaffected by high-interest rates. Nothing is gonna happen but there is one major weakness of the United States i.e. the dollar. Yeah, it's kinda funny though the strongest weapon in their arsenal which makes the USA superpower is actually the Achilles heel of the United States. So you see guys USA is prone to high-interest rates but not the rest of the world. Just look at this.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/khvkbohkud5b1.jpg?width=1495&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=089fa3dad5ab985e7f667c210cfd583a34eb05af

&#x200B;

This happened bcoz every country except the USA has mostly 2.5yr times where their rate changes even for a fixed rate. Now think for a sec. 

&#x200B;

What if I come to your house/company tomorrow and tell you "" I am sorry sir/ma'am your fixed rate which you locked in before the hiking cycle began is not really fixed at all"" 

&#x200B;

This above thing happened to one of my friend. So if default rates skyrocket in every country except the United States and recession begins early with inflation falling ( kinda what's happening in Spain ) with headlines like Asia financial crisis or European crisis then currencies of Europe and Asia will get weaker a/g dollar. Safe haven trade will kick in and interest rate differential or any other factor will get thrown out of the window. The only currency which will not is the Yen. In a deflationary crisis, Yen actually becomes stronger but let's for some reason Yen becomes weaker like it is right now I expect Dxy to easily go past 120+ or maybe 150+ like Volcker days. And that my friends is what will put an end to the inflation and cause a huge deflationary shock to the system. Not rates, just Dxy! To combat this the Fed will use CBDC's or some other measure to again save the system and then my friends I don't know what's gonna happen. Who knows maybe this is what is happening right now while everyone is partying like it's a new bull market. Usually, the hints are 2% or more drop in CPI in a month :) 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Result: Regardless of how you see it guys I am bearish. Now doesn't matter the deflationary shock or reinflation part it is going to be bad for equities. And then one of them is good for gold and the other for bonds. So nothing has really changed for me I am still Camp Stagflation who has hedged himself for a Deflationary outcome by buying bonds. I am still 60% short and 40% long.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Position :** 

 [https://1drv.ms/i/s!Ai-SLDVjdnGtkkGfO1jY1WYC\_9\_L](https://1drv.ms/i/s!Ai-SLDVjdnGtkkGfO1jY1WYC_9_L) 

Sorry, my image limit got hit.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Final thoughts :**

The real reason why I'm back is because I missed all of you, not because I wanted to smack the sh9t out of bulls. Oh, and I've also fallen back into my old drinking habits again. Now that I recall I never really explained to you guys why I drink so much, so here it goes. My girl left me because I wasn't there for her during tough times. Now she's making a ton of money while I'm stuck trying to move on. She even called me during the SVB days just to check up on me, and we spent a few days together. She is a great person though and I thought maybe I could win her back if I got my act together, which is why I stopped writing. But recently, I found out that she's got a new boyfriend now. So, I'm back to my old ways, writing doomsday posts about the upcoming crisis that no one really sees and attacking the 4 pockets of low liquidity with my bear friends.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Enjoy the weekend everyone. 

See you guys next week!

&#x200B;

If you want the latest AI news as it drops, [look here first](https://www.theedge.so/subscribe). But all of the information is here for your convenience.

**Why is this important?** 

**Advancements in multimodal learning, New dataset and evaluation framework, it is an Open-source release.** 

This innovative model merges video and language in a way that allows for meaningful, detailed conversations about videos.  
This approach draws inspiration from vision-language (VL) models, typically used for video domain tasks. However, given the scarcity of video-caption pairs and the hefty resources required to train on such data, VL models usually rely on pre-trained image-based models for video tasks. Video-ChatGPT builds upon the Language-aligned Large Vision Assistant (LLaVA), which marries the visual encoder of CLIP with the Vicuna language decoder.  
LLaVA has been fine-tuned end-to-end on generated instructional vision-language data. With Video-ChatGPT, we take this one step further and fine-tune this model using video-instruction data, priming it for video conversation tasks.  
A question-answer pair makes up the video-instruction data. By training Video-ChatGPT with this setup, the model gains a comprehensive understanding of videos, cultivates attention to temporal relationships, and develops conversation capabilities.

**But what sets Video-ChatGPT apart?** For the first time, we've got a quantitative video conversation evaluation framework at our disposal. This novel framework permits accurate evaluation of video conversation models, based on aspects like correctness of information, detail orientation, contextual understanding, temporal understanding, and consistency.

The training dataset for Video-ChatGPT is a collection of 100,000 video-instruction pairs, pulled from various video-sharing platforms and manually reviewed for relevance and accuracy. This dataset is another exciting contribution of Video-ChatGPT and is set to be an excellent resource for future research in video conversation models.  
**But how does this affect you?**  Think of its applications in education, entertainment, and surveillance. Teachers can give tailored feedback based on student video submissions; content creators can craft interactive, engaging video content; and surveillance systems can generate real-time insights from video footage.

It's not just a tool, but an open platform that invites collaboration, exploration, and a plethora of new applications. From augmenting educational tools, enhancing entertainment experiences, to boosting surveillance effectiveness, Video-ChatGPT's potentials are endless.

147guo1,118,2023-06-12,[A LEVELS] Update to the Holy Grail: Mark 6 (INTRODUCING: WEB VERSION),u/cowbaecowboo,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/147guo1/a_levels_update_to_the_holy_grail_mark_6/,"TLDR: links for [drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gC6GQLgcuoHzwDXtEGzTwvzCz0YsYuwg), [telegram](https://t.me/+FlxeSKjMXIk2ZjA1), [web version](https://grail.moe/), post explains how the web version of grail works + rationale + planned updates + bunch of faq

good morning my fellow men women people children animals idk its not even 2 years yet we already have a mark 6 maybe im too invested into this thing and should retire soon or something so like half of this is copy pasted from my previous post cuz im too lazy to use chatgpt to write this post (hello does anyone want to be an understudy and is unproblematic i am also biased to ppl i have actl talked to before hmu /hj)

**what is holy grail?**

a free crowdsourced repository of academic materials spanning over a decade for students, contributed to by students.

**why am i making this post?**

a lot of things have changed since the induction of mark 5, including some drama that i will briefly address in a bit.

Updates include:

* mewsika has retired from Holy Grail so most of your queries/contributions should be directed to me now (u/cowbaecowboo or cowmoomoo on Discord)
* [telegram channel](https://t.me/+FlxeSKjMXIk2ZjA1) for smaller updates that don't require major groundbreaking posts so i highly suggest joining the telegram channel for greater clarity and transparency regarding how the grail is run (also because grail is technically independent of sgexams, so having an independent ""platform"" for info dissemination is better)
* soft release of holy grail: [the web version](https://grail.moe/) (as a trial)
* renaming of the notes/tys section of holy grail to holy communion (someone told me to rename it to communion and i forgor who was the genius who told me to rename it as a christian i am ashamed i forgor it was a good alternative to water but thats beside the point lol creds to the person) after the *incident*

**wait! i have so many questions! what is the web version of the grail? will the drive not be available anymore?**

no the drive will still be there and will still continue to be updated, but now we're working on developing a trialed web version of the grail for a number of reasons:

* increased interactivity from users themselves where they can directly upload materials to the grail itself instead of through a middleman (admin), but still subject to admin approval
* aforementioned makes it easier to administrate
* when we say grail is for students by students we want to take this up a whole new notch where you can actually feel directly involved in the contributing
* google drive limit for a free account is 15 gb lol the entire grail is worth 42gb
* it'll be a fun venture to look into regardless of whether or not the trial is successful; this allows us to prioritise what is more ""in demand"" by users to improve the user experience
* it (may or may not be easier) to navigate for people who aren't used to the numerous subfolders in the google drive

regardless whether or not the web version is a success with yall, holy grail has just moved on to its new era, mark 6

**how to use the web version?**

most people who just view (instead of contributing 😡😡😡) the notes or papers do not require an account but in order to contribute you just have to sign up for an account (like an actual website! wow) in a 1 minute process just to verify that you're not a bot and then you will be able to directly upload to the website

ok since the guest interface should be quite intuitive i'll just do a how-to on contributing to the grail

FOR CONTRIBUTORS:

step 1: click ""log in""

step 2: scroll down and press ""register now""

step 3: sign up for an account and do your email verification etc

step 4: after u sign in to ur account click home and then click ""contribute notes""

step 5: pick appropriate fields (the website will auto name the file)

step 6: press submit

NOTE: we will be modifying how this is done with more specific fields to further streamline the process (for now u cant like name same document name)

**eh how come so inconvenient the web version ah why all my things not assorted by sch or like not specific leh or why XXX is missing why u release when not even finished 100% yet**

bear with us la this is still new we need to sort a lot of things out and its only possible with YOUR help and feedback (but disclaimer not everything is implementable) that you can provide here at [this thread](https://t.me/c/1796571081/272) (or if u dont have telegram u can pm me u/cowbaecowboo) + also theres no such thing as finish 100% because we will always seek to evolve and make the grail a better platform for your studies and conducive learning

here's a list of things that are planned as updates for the web version (which means they're not here in the meantime and this list is NOT EXHAUSTIVE):

* multi file upload (currently only single file upload is supported but we're aiming to solve that soon)
* document name filter
* sort by date/time range uploaded
* sort by year category (school category on hold first because if we categorise by school then it'll be super duper obvious where is from where so we're not super duper keen to add it as a field its like inviting trouble uk)
* anonymous username selection to hide identity of contributor
* download button within the documents

there are other issues that also need to be addressed but not everything can be addressed yet/i dont rmb what other things need to be addressed so they are not included here, therefore list is *non exhaustive*

the files on the web version have been downloaded from one of the most recent versions of the grail (which happens to have various files missing) so not everything is up there yet 

**why should you help with the grail?**

although there are already many materials added to holy grail, there are a few subjects (and exam levels) that lack academic materials here and there (etc quite a lot of H1 subjects, IB materials from international schools etc etc) + a lot of notes have been from past years and with syllabus changes some might be outdated already like bruh ri notes are from 2017 thats like 7 years ago and we really hope you could help to contribute! every contribution really makes student life a bit more easier to study in singapore :)

**what can i do to help?**

feel free to drop your notes/exam papers to me! if you want, we can give you proper credits in the README file. it would be preferable if the materials are a clean copy (for exam papers + answer sheets) and have an online pdf/are scanned but if you still want to contribute hardcopy materials and are unable to scan them, dm me and we can probably work something out!

update: now you can also directly contribute to the grail itself via the web version! just sign up for an account (like the sgexams website) and you will be able to upload your files directly to the site (pls unzip them tho i hate all of u who don't bother to unzip ur files i not that free ok)

**who is behind the web development team? can i join?**

the web development team comprises a number of anonymous volunteers who wish for it to remain that way but if you want to join and have good proficiency in coding in various programming languages especially python, typescript or react hmu and i'll link you up

&#x200B;

OTHER QUESTIONS (not as important but in case you want to kaypoh)

* what happened ah that made mark 5 into mark 6?

i will neither confirm nor deny whatever allegations were brought up during that entire era but i can assure you the holy grail is in safe hands and appropriate actions have been taken as precautionary measures

* help why i have missing folders?

i'm still trying to sort what's missing and what's not so yeah bear with me guys"

147lp82,1,2023-06-12,Learn Astrology Course From The Astrologers | Occult Science,u/Occultscience2,u_Occultscience2,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Occultscience2/comments/147lp82/learn_astrology_course_from_the_astrologers/,"#                                                Astrology Course

Astrology is the study of how distant celestial bodies—typically stars and planets—affect the lives of humans. Along with other forms of divination, it is believed that a person's personality, romantic connections, and financial future are all influenced by the sun, stars, moon, and planets at the time of their birth (not their conception).

Most individuals are familiar with their ""sign,"" which is one of the 12 constellations of the zodiac while discussing astrology. This type of astrology is based on the sun-sign system, which is the system used to create newspaper horoscopes. It is most likely the easiest kind because all that is required to create a sun-sign horoscope is the person's birthdate. Numerous astrologers will claim that this type of astrology is accurate.

##                                      What is Zodiac?

The ecliptic, a circle that decides the apparent passage of the sun among the constellations for a year, is a belt that lies within roughly 8 degrees on either side of it. This belt is known as the zodiac. 

##                   How Many Zodiac Sign In Astrology?

Cancer, Leo, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Libra, Aries, Scorpio, Virgo, Taurus, Pisces, Gemini, and Aquarius are the 12 signs of the zodiac.

##                   What is astrology used for?

People's personalities and behaviours were thought to be influenced by astrology based on their birth dates. It was created to instruct individuals on how to spend their lives in line with their horoscope signs.

##                  Analysis of a Vedic birth chart

A birth chart, sometimes referred to as a guide to planetary situations at the time of birth, is very helpful in understanding various aspects of a person's character, career, relationships, and prospects. Twelve houses, twelve signs, and nine to twelve planets create an astrology birth chart. A birth reading is nothing more than arranging the signs, houses, and planets in a horoscope chosen at random.

This teaching is to prepare you to develop a financial analysis presentation. Submit a PowerPoint file with presentation slides along with a word document with detailed notes about each slide. This should be submitted as two separate documents, one ppt and one microsoft word. Do not submit links or links to documents that need to be opened. Here is a summary of what you need to cover in your presentation. Number of slides should be between 10 and 15. Keep in mind to synthesize information you need to paraphrase, summarize, and sometime quote. Do not just cut and paste paragraphs from ChatGPT.

Should we follow suit? I was consulted because I had just convened a three-day faculty seminar on artificial intelligence and liberal arts education, which included conversation partners hailing from biology, studio art, education, mathematics, economics, sociology, computer science, theology, and philosophy, among other disciplines.""

""I urged caution for three reasons. First, while my colleagues all recognized that the new tools could be used to cheat on assignments in their classes (and some shared stories of how students had already done so), no one suggested that we outlaw AI entirely. Some voiced optimism about generative AI's promise for education, others skepticism. One participant had already integrated Midjourney into his creative practice.""

""Second, a statement that targets current brands such as ChatGPT would approach the problem too narrowly. Even prohibiting generative AI (as a larger category) may quickly prove problematic, given how many applications will soon receive an AI injection. With the unveiling of the Wordcraft Writers Workshop last year, for example, Google previewed how a large language model can be integrated into a word processing application as an editor, brainstorming partner, and ghost writer. In the very near future, then, students won't need to pay covert visits to ChatGPT; the AI assistant will be built into Microsoft Word, Google Docs, and whatever comes next. As a result, tools that now look like cheatware may, to our future students, appear to be ordinary parts of word processing.""

""Finally, singling out ChatGPT in our syllabuses would send the wrong signal. We must not delude ourselves: Generative AI cannot be dealt with simply by putting the right regulations in place.

The next few paragraphs will hopefully makes sense.   
**Current situation**  
recent break up. I'm still not over her, I felt reckless and we told ourselves we weren't  ready for another relationship bc are good friends, but I asked her out, and it lasted about a month. We stayed back friends, but she wanted to move on (but still wants me). Both of us needed to be more responsible to our actions, but damn I miss that connection. Maybe we'll come back together, if not then that's okay. We both want to be our very best, and it seems like we can be our best when we're alone. I felt like I was a horrible boyfriend to her and I WAS EVEN HER 1ST BOYFRIEND. SHE WAS A GEM AND A ANGEL TO ME WHEN WE WERE FRIENDS AND NOW WE CHANGED BECAUSE OF MY RECKLESSNESS AND INSECURIIES AND MY FUCKING ADDICTION TO PMO. GOD I FELT SO DISGUSTED ON MYSELF.   
I think, I'm just also scared of working the corporate life for the next decades. Talking 'adult stuff' like insurance, health, jobs, fucking cars and expenses, humble brags,afraid to be a linkedIn Lunatic basically. Idk how some of my friends were manage to get a good corporate job and travel outside of the US and joy their youths. However, it's something I might have to go through with like all other functional adults do, but without doing what my heart wants to do. Maybe that's maturaty. Maybe I have to sacrafice a bit of my youth for some stability in my american 'dream'. Get a job, car, house, american wife, children, work, investments, other boring topic. AND PLEASE IF I HEAR A FUCKING ""Well, yeah, it's boring, but some tasks are actually interesting to me"", IMMA EXPLODE BECAUSE EITHER YOURE LYING OR IT""S SOMETHING I HAVE TO FACE. LINKEDIN LUNATICS ARE FUCKING RAHHHHHH IT'S LIKE YOU ACTING LIKE ""HEY IM A BETTER SLAVE THAN YOU"". FUCKING REAL ESTATE. THAT DOESN""T MAKE FUCKING SENSE BUT I HAVE TO LEARN IT AND IM STILL CONFUSED, IMMA CHATGPT MYSELF INTO EXPLAN REAL ESTATE LIKE FUCKING 5  
**What my heart wants to do**  
I wanted to a least live a nomadic life (for a few years), and not worry about all of this: Money, and the American 'Dream'. To visit numerous countries and to meet new people.   
And then live a type os aesthetic of ""old money"" or a ""luxurous life""  
I wanted to build a business and be a founder of a tech company or whatever.   
I wanted to provide stability not only for myself, but for my family. While me living in my dream and do what I love.   
**I keep bitching about it and what 'my american self' wants to do**  
I feel like, I'm destined to not go anywhere or move anywhere....  
I talked with a catholic priest near my campus about my problems in school and life and basically the goal as a believer is to ""get into heaven"". Like the ultimate goal to life is to go to heaven. To be closer to Jesus. I believe in it. I was born with it. However, it feels like I won't be able to do what my heart wants. My local priest who I usually go to Mass with becuase it's the only Vietnamese Catholic Church in the state (I think?) lightly implies that we shouldn't live a life that we want because God has a plan. So, am I destined to be miserable until I maybe go to heaven? Actually, I am not certian. Maybe because I automatically go to hell because of my addiction or any commandment i broke? Maybe because I didn't follow the right religion? The right denomination? Even some told me that I'll go to hell because of my faith. Some catholics (or trads) that I'm doing this all wrong. But then again, it's like I have to stay in state and be dull as possible.   
Because of the fact my family immagrated here from the war, I have conflicting feelings. Yes, someday I want to move back to VN. Note that I am MEDIORCRE AT MY VIETNAMESE. in addition, I'll be considered a ""viet kieu"" or ""people of Vietnamese descent or who grew up in Vietnam but moved overseas."". I'm not sure how Vietnamese people think about this... IM NOT SURE WHAT MY PARENTS WILL THINK ABOUT THIS. MY DAD'S FAMILY MOVED TO THE US FOR A BETTER LIFE AND FOR POLITICAL REASONS FROM THE WAR OBVOULSLY JUST FOR ME TO GO BACK TO THE COUNTRY WHERE IT WAS FOUGHT?   
**What actions I will take**  
Aside from all of this. I'm taking some small, actionable steps to hopefully figure out what to do in my life and to see what are my priorities.   
Getting new skills and making projects I want to build to help others in my 'community'.: I mean, I see problems, and I have solutions. Not really sure if its something they like, but it does give me some time get more project experience and figuring out what I like to code and build. It could be a potential SaaS business and it's something small and im happy to fail. Also participating online hackathons are really cool so i'll be doing that in the summer.   
continue build a youtube audience on my dev journey. I know how building a brand works from other experiences, but idk I want to try it to keep myself busy alonside work an project.   
Starting a new club. I think all of my classmates need some community in the Software development field in campus and figure out what type of developer they can be and build awesome projects outside of school   
Go back to the gym. No brainer. I want to look good naked for myself obvously.   
Learn how to be a better student: I had shit grades right now. 5 classes wasn't the move for the greatest academic comeback of all time.   
Read more books: I miss them, idk why I found it boring before.   
Just touch grass and hang out with friends: I need to do that more.   
**Uni therapy kind of doesnt work.**   
Quick rant, but counselors never follow up on me even though they told me they will :/ So it's my responsiblity to check up on myself.   
**What im grateful for.**   
A loving family, though I am misunderstood sometimes, but it's something I need to learn by learning vietnamese.  
A house, clothes, a new job that pays a little more than my previous job, my friends that checks up on me, my support group, talking with God sometimes, meeting new people online, building a community, taking the first step to greatness... (i think)  
**Final notes**  
**I felt way better writing this down. it made me understood myself a bit more everyday. but there are some things that might be contrieversial towards religion, relationships, careers. So please, critize me. Educate me. because I'm the dumbest person alive. I'm always learning new things and new perspectives. And I don't go to this platform a lot, but I'll do my best to listen to everyone.**

However, it's something I might have to go through with like all other functional adults do, but without doing what my heart wants to do. Maybe that's maturaty. Maybe I have to sacrifice a bit of my youth for some stability in my american 'dream'. Get a job, car, house, American wife, children, work, investments, other boring topic. AND PLEASE IF I HEAR A FUCKING ""Well, yeah, it's boring, but some tasks are actually interesting to me"", IMMA EXPLODE BECAUSE EITHER YOURE LYING OR IT""S SOMETHING I HAVE TO FACE. LINKEDIN LUNATICS ARE FUCKING RAHHHHHH IT'S LIKE YOU ACTING LIKE ""HEY IM A BETTER SLAVE THAN YOU"". FUCKING REAL ESTATE. THAT DOESN""T MAKE FUCKING SENSE BUT I HAVE TO LEARN IT AND IM STILL CONFUSED, IMMA CHATGPT MYSELF INTO EXPLAN REAL ESTATE LIKE FUCKING 5  
What my heart wants to do  
I wanted to a least live a nomadic life (for a few years), and not worry about all of this: Money, and the American 'Dream'. To visit numerous countries and to meet new people.  
And then live a type of aesthetic of ""old money"" or a ""luxurious life""  
I wanted to build a business and be a founder of a tech company or whatever.  
I wanted to provide stability not only for myself, but for my family. While me living in my dream and do what I love.  
I keep bitching about it and what 'my American self' wants to do  
I feel like, I'm destined to not go anywhere or move anywhere....  
I talked with a catholic priest near my campus about my problems in school and life and basically the goal as a believer is to ""get into heaven"". Like the ultimate goal to life is to go to heaven. To be closer to Jesus. I believe in it. I was born with it. However, it feels like I won't be able to do what my heart wants. My local priest who I usually go to Mass with because it's the only Vietnamese Catholic Church in the state (I think?) lightly implies that we shouldn't live a life that we want because God has a plan. So, am I destined to be miserable until I maybe go to heaven? Actually, I am not certain. Maybe because I automatically go to hell because of my addiction or any commandment i broke? Maybe because I didn't follow the right religion? The right denomination? Even some told me that I'll go to hell because of my faith. Some Catholics (or trads) that I'm doing this all wrong. But then again, it's like I have to stay in state and be dull as possible.  
Because of the fact my family immigrated here from the war, I have conflicting feelings. Yes, someday I want to move back to VN. Note that I am MEDIORCRE AT MY VIETNAMESE. in addition, I'll be considered a ""viet kieu"" or ""people of Vietnamese descent or who grew up in Vietnam but moved overseas."". I'm not sure how Vietnamese people think about this... IM NOT SURE WHAT MY PARENTS WILL THINK ABOUT THIS. MY DAD'S FAMILY MOVED TO THE US FOR A BETTER LIFE AND FOR POLITICAL REASONS FROM THE WAR OBVOULSLY JUST FOR ME TO GO BACK TO THE COUNTRY WHERE IT WAS FOUGHT?  
What actions I will take  
Aside from all of this. I'm taking some small, actionable steps to hopefully figure out what to do in my life and to see what are my priorities.  
Getting new skills and making projects I want to build to help others in my 'community'.: I mean, I see problems, and I have solutions. Not really sure if its something they like, but it does give me some time get more project experience and figuring out what I like to code and build. It could be a potential SaaS business and it's something small and im happy to fail. Also participating online hackathons are really cool so i'll be doing that in the summer.  
continue build a youtube audience on my dev journey. I know how building a brand works from other experiences, but idk I want to try it to keep myself busy alongside work an project.  
Starting a new club. I think all of my classmates need some community in the Software development field in campus and figure out what type of developer they can be and build awesome projects outside of school  
Go back to the gym. No brainer. I want to look good naked for myself obviously.  
Learn how to be a better student: I had shit grades right now. 5 classes wasn't the move for the greatest academic comeback of all time.  
Read more books: I miss them, idk why I found it boring before.  
Just touch grass and hang out with friends: I need to do that more.  
Uni therapy kind of doesn't work.  
Quick rant, but counselors never follow up on me even though they told me they will :/ So it's my responsibility to check up on myself.  
What im grateful for.  
A loving family, though I am misunderstood sometimes, but it's something I need to learn by learning Vietnamese.  
A house, clothes, a new job that pays a little more than my previous job, my friends that checks up on me, my support group, talking with God sometimes, meeting new people online, building a community, taking the first step to greatness... (i think)  
Final notes  
I felt way better writing this down. it made me understood myself a bit more everyday. but there are some things that might be controversial towards religion, relationships, careers. So please, criticize me. Educate me. because I'm the dumbest person alive. I'm always learning new things and new perspectives. And I don't go to this platform a lot, but I'll do my best to listen to everyone.  
So, Am I playing life on hard mode? or I'm making all of this hard on myself?  
  
TL;DR: I think it made this hard on myself, but I'll keep going"

148a4am,1,2023-06-13,Am I playing life on hard mode or am I making it hard for myself?,u/[deleted],TrueOffMyChest,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/148a4am/am_i_playing_life_on_hard_mode_or_am_i_making_it/,"Intro  
  
I am just writing it down. Write down what I’m feeling about my life, so I won’t feel anxiety. I do want to mention I am taking actionable steps to get where I wanted to be, but I have to start small. I’m sure there are people who are going through WORSE than me and I empathize their struggles and hope for the best for them. I think, this is my story. Please note that I'm not really good at intreperting  
  
Identity  
  
I am a (2nd?) gen, 21 y/o Vietnamese American male, Gen Z, Catholic, now single, somewhat have both conservative and liberal values, 6’0, 175 lbs skinny (fat?), INFJ person who doesn't have his driver’s license, but prefers taking public transportation, haven't worked out in a few months, software development major who just switched from CS, living with parents with 4 other siblings and a dog, living in a ivory home with a nice neighborhood, ADHD?, kind of ugly?, hygiene is good, but could work on my fashion. Gamer who is hardstuck but who is cutting down the game time for a few weeks now. Not sure why, but I find it more enjoyable to craft things software or in arts.  
  
Struggles  
  
I felt like getting an summer internship at sophmore year and junior year was like a norm as a CS student, but it didn't know it was so competitive and 300+ applications and a few interviews later, no offer at all. I updated my resume like 5 times over the course of 10 months and even career centers were like ""yeah doesn't look good enough"" LIKE WHAT? YOU TOLD ME TO CHANGE IT. I MEAN YEAH RESUMES ARE UPDATED ONCE IN A WHlLE BUT NOT TILL THE POINT I NEED TO CHANGE IT EVERYTIME I NEED TO APPLY OR SOME COMPUTER PROGRAM TELLS ME THAT MY RESUME ISN'T 80% MATCH TO THE JOB DESCRIPTION. EVEN IF IT'S A 80%, IM GOING AGAINST LIKE 700 MORE APPLICANTS FOR A STUPID COMPANY THAT DOESN'T MAKE FUCKING SENSE. MAYBE IM NOT MATURING ENOUGH MAYBE IM NOT CORPORATE ENOUGH MAYBE IM NOT AMERICAN ENOUGH. MAYBE IM NOT LOOKING AT THE WRONG JOBS? SOFTWARE ENGINEERING INTERN? SOFTWARE DEVELOPER INTERN? HOW THE FUCK DO I SEARCH FOR JOBS EVEN IF I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO. IM A FUCKING SENIOR AND I JUST FIGURED OUT WHAT TO DO. I JUST DONT KNOW IF I WOULD FIND A GOOD COMPANY THAT INTERESTS ME.  
  
I recently cut the use of IG and other social media apps so I can focus on doing my own things. Before that, I felt so envious for my friends who were able to go outside town or the country to enjoy their lives. Like yes, I'm happy for them! It's just I felt like I will never get to experience this type of thing until I'm older. BeReal was also a cool social media app, but I felt like most of my friends took moments when they are 'actually' good moments and idk why I felt bad about myself. ""Am I mediorcre? Am I just boring? Do I have a boring life? Am I just poor, a broke college student?"". I have a lot of friend groups, but rarely hang out because I don't really belong to any. I felt like I was a side friend in each friend group. Most of the time, I just feel lonely.  
  
my mental is so weak. I've been dealing with PMO for a couple of years now and a three years back I decided to fight it, but I fumbled a lot. The highest I could go is 90 days without it. Right now, I decided to invest myself to a support group for a couple of buck per month my group is pretty cool and I am grateful for it. I still fumbled, and that's the reason why I also deleted social media (or at least cut from it), is because I'm looking at some content that tempts me to go to their OF, or their actual hub page. (Yes, I'm down bad or was i guess). Also I don't mind, but i don't fucking know why White Male and Asian/asian american Female couples irritates me so much. Like I'm happy for them and it's not my fucking business and it shouldn't be my fucking business, but maybe I was taught to hate on the idea from social media? I don't fucking know. My SISTER IS DATING A WHITE MAN, AND I ACTUALLY VIBE WITH HIM SO HOPEFULLY THAT HELPS ME DEAL WITH THE STUPID IGNORANCE I HAVE TAHT SHOULDNT BE PLANTED IN MY BRAIN FROM SOCIAL FUCKING MEDIA AND THE HUB. Please, I don't intend to send hate to the couples that are reading this. I'm happy for you, it's just a me problem and it's something I have to deal with alone. I don't want to think this hateful way and with other hateful ways that I have. ALSO I THINK I GOT INTO A REDPILL RABBIT HOLE. LOOK SOME INFLUENCERS MAKES GOOD POINTS AND I SHOULD DEFINTELY Discipline MYSELF and BE ON A SELF DEVELOPMENT JOURNEY,ITS NOT A COMMUNITY I LIKE TO JOIN.  
  
The next few paragraphs will hopefully makes sense.  
  
Current situation  
  
recent break up. I'm still not over her, I felt reckless and we told ourselves we weren't ready for another relationship bc are good friends, but I asked her out, and it lasted about a month. We stayed back friends, but she wanted to move on (but still wants me). Both of us needed to be more responsible to our actions, but damn I miss that connection. Maybe we'll come back together, if not then that's okay. We both want to be our very best, and it seems like we can be our best when we're alone. I felt like I was a horrible boyfriend to her and I WAS EVEN HER 1ST BOYFRIEND. SHE WAS A GEM AND A ANGEL TO ME WHEN WE WERE FRIENDS AND NOW WE CHANGED BECAUSE OF MY RECKLESSNESS AND INSECURIIES AND MY FUCKING ADDICTION TO PMO. GOD I FELT SO DISGUSTED ON MYSELF.  
  
I think, I'm just also scared of working the corporate life for the next decades. Talking 'adult stuff' like insurance, health, jobs, fucking cars and expenses, humble brags,afraid to be a linkedIn Lunatic basically. Idk how some of my friends were manage to get a good corporate job and travel outside of the US and joy their youths. However, it's something I might have to go through with like all other functional adults do, but without doing what my heart wants to do. Maybe that's maturaty. Maybe I have to sacrifice a bit of my youth for some stability in my american 'dream'. Get a job, car, house, American wife, children, work, investments, other boring topic. AND PLEASE IF I HEAR A FUCKING ""Well, yeah, it's boring, but some tasks are actually interesting to me"", IMMA EXPLODE BECAUSE EITHER YOURE LYING OR IT""S SOMETHING I HAVE TO FACE. LINKEDIN LUNATICS ARE FUCKING RAHHHHHH IT'S LIKE YOU ACTING LIKE ""HEY IM A BETTER SLAVE THAN YOU"". FUCKING REAL ESTATE. THAT DOESN""T MAKE FUCKING SENSE BUT I HAVE TO LEARN IT AND IM STILL CONFUSED, IMMA CHATGPT MYSELF INTO EXPLAN REAL ESTATE LIKE FUCKING 5  
  
What my heart wants to do  
  
I wanted to a least live a nomadic life (for a few years), and not worry about all of this: Money, and the American 'Dream'. To visit numerous countries and to meet new people.  
  
And then live a type of aesthetic of ""old money"" or a ""luxurious life""

As in, I had not even coded my first hello world. I have been learning C for about 1-2 months.

Ive been sticking through it and honestly every time I see a project, I do not know where to start. I have been trying to learn through chatgpt giving me little exercises, for the beginner I get there pretty easily, but as soon as tasks go to a bit more advanced I cant do it. I get the solution, and after a while I can see how they came to that conclusion however if I had zero help and had to solve the problem on my own, I just dont think I have the IQ to do it.

Is this normal for beginners? Will I get there in the end? Its just everytime I try my hardest and my brain just struggles.

For the record, I did hard a-levels (UK), could do most of the maths in lesson after revising but this is just on another level entirely and I feel like CS students are the top of the top of the top, which I am not.

I know that they say coding is 90% practice and it has been helping, its just with large projects I just think it would take such a long long time practicing constantly to be able to get there - if at all.

ALSO, if anybody has good learning courses with exercises(because they help the most) please LET ME KNOW. I watched bro codes 4 hour long video and a lot of other videos, but for example they go through topics like loops in 8 minutes  and when it comes to applying what youve learned to projects I'd say it has barely helped, all the courses I see teach things for simple application but never a thorough explanation on how they can be used more advanced."

Detecting TF2 Cheating

June 13, 2023

tell a story about how a person can tell if someone is using a bot on team fortress two or how to know they are cheating; while you are playing and just by observation.

ChatGPT

Once upon a time, in the vibrant world of Team Fortress 2, there was a skilled player named Alex who had spent countless hours honing his gameplay. He was an expert at sniffing out cheaters and detecting bots just by observing their behavior during matches.

&#x200B;

One sunny afternoon, Alex joined a competitive match on a Capture the Flag map. As the game started, he kept a keen eye on his opponents, determined to spot any signs of cheating. Here's how he went about it:

&#x200B;

Unnatural Movement: Alex knew that bots often displayed erratic and unnatural movement patterns. While playing, he observed the enemy players closely. If he noticed someone moving in a rigid, jerky manner, frequently snapping to aim directly at opponents or making uncannily precise movements, it was a telltale sign of a bot.

&#x200B;

Perfect Aim: A common trait of cheating bots is their inhumanly precise aim. Alex kept a close watch on the enemy players' aiming capabilities. If he noticed an opponent consistently landing headshots or hitting every shot with pinpoint accuracy, even in chaotic situations, it was a strong indication of cheating.

&#x200B;

Predictable Patterns: Bots often follow repetitive patterns or behave predictably. Alex paid attention to how opponents moved around the map, captured objectives, or engaged in combat. If an enemy player repeated the same actions in a loop, such as running the exact same route every time or repeatedly making identical movements, it suggested the presence of a bot.

&#x200B;

Instant Reaction Times: Another aspect Alex observed was the reaction time of the opponents. When a player immediately responds with lightning-fast reflexes to any unexpected event, it could be an indication of cheats. Bots typically have near-instant reaction times, making it suspiciously easy for them to counter attacks or evade danger.

&#x200B;

Lack of Communication: Bots are infamous for their silence. They don't engage in team chat or voice communication, focusing solely on their programmed objectives. Alex paid attention to the behavior of players who didn't respond to messages or requests for coordination, which hinted at the possibility of a bot being used.

&#x200B;

Throughout the match, Alex meticulously gathered evidence, keeping mental notes of suspicious behavior exhibited by certain opponents. By combining these observations, he became confident in his assessment of potential cheaters or bots on the enemy team.

&#x200B;

After the game concluded, Alex reported his suspicions to the game administrators, providing detailed explanations of each player's suspicious behavior. The administrators reviewed his report and took appropriate action, investigating the players in question. Thanks to Alex's vigilant observations and dedication to fair gameplay, the community became a safer and more enjoyable place for everyone.

&#x200B;

From that day forward, Alex became known as the defender of fair play, sharing his insights and strategies with others to help them spot cheaters and bots in Team Fortress 2. His legacy served as a reminder that with careful observation, players could maintain the integrity of the game they loved and keep the virtual battlefield free from unfair advantages.

&#x200B;

ChatGPT

Once upon a time, in the dynamic world of Team Fortress 2, there was a dedicated player named Sarah. She possessed a keen eye for identifying cheaters and bots during her gameplay sessions. Sarah not only knew how to detect such players, but she also believed in upholding the rules and maintaining a fair gaming environment for all.

&#x200B;

One evening, Sarah joined a bustling server for an intense round of King of the Hill. As the game commenced, she immediately noticed suspicious behavior from a player named Max. Determined to expose and remove the cheater from the server while adhering to the rules, Sarah sprang into action.

&#x200B;

Observing the Impossible: Sarah knew that cheaters often performed actions that were simply impossible for regular players. She kept a close watch on Max's actions. Within minutes, she noticed Max repeatedly landing perfect headshots with unusual precision, even from impossible angles or through walls. Such extraordinary feats were clear indicators of cheating.

&#x200B;

Unnatural Responses: Cheaters tend to exhibit unnatural responses and behaviors. Sarah observed Max's reactions to unexpected events or enemy movements. She noticed that Max always seemed aware of incoming enemies, even without any line of sight or teammate communication. His instantaneous and flawless responses were beyond what any human player could achieve.

&#x200B;

Inhuman Agility: Sarah paid attention to Max's movement throughout the game. She noticed that he moved with superhuman speed and agility, performing complex maneuvers effortlessly. Whether it was rocket jumps or intricate dodges, Max's movements were too precise and fluid to be genuine.

&#x200B;

Silent Communication: In a team-based game like Team Fortress 2, communication is crucial for coordination. Sarah noticed that Max never engaged in any form of communication, either through text chat or voice chat. He never responded to requests for assistance or coordinated attacks. His lack of teamwork and silence made it evident that he was not a fair player.

&#x200B;

As Sarah gathered more evidence, she knew it was time to take action. Following the server's rules, she took the following steps to force Max off the server:

&#x200B;

Recording Evidence: Sarah began recording Max's suspicious behavior using built-in game recording features or third-party software. She wanted to gather solid evidence that could be shared with the server administrators.

&#x200B;

Reporting to Server Administrators: Sarah reached out to the server administrators, providing them with a detailed report of Max's behavior and the evidence she had collected. She included timestamps of specific incidents and described how Max's actions violated the game's fair play rules.

&#x200B;

Encouraging Other Players: Sarah discreetly informed her teammates and even members of the opposing team about her suspicions. Many players were already aware of Max's unfair gameplay and were supportive of her efforts to maintain a fair gaming environment.

&#x200B;

Demonstrating Sportsmanship: Sarah emphasized the importance of fair play to the entire server community. She encouraged players to focus on enjoying the game and playing by the rules, rather than resorting to cheating or exploiting unfair advantages.

&#x200B;

After reviewing the evidence provided by Sarah and witnessing the overwhelming support from other players, the server administrators swiftly took action. They issued a temporary ban on Max, ensuring he couldn't disrupt the server with his cheating anymore.

&#x200B;

Sarah's dedication to fair play and her adherence to the server's rules made her a respected figure among the community. Her actions inspired other players to actively report cheaters and bots, creating a united front against unfair gameplay.

&#x200B;

From that day forward, the server became a safer and more enjoyable place to play Team Fortress 2, thanks to Sarah's vigilant observation and commitment to upholding the rules.

ChatGPT

Once upon a time, in the dynamic realm of Team Fortress 2, there was a skilled player named Mark. He prided himself on fair play and sportsmanship, always aiming to create an enjoyable gaming environment for everyone. However, Mark found himself in a challenging situation when faced with a persistent cheater who seemed to evade consequences despite following the rules.

&#x200B;

One fateful day, Mark joined a popular server for an intense game of Payload. As the battle commenced, he quickly noticed an opponent named Chris exhibiting suspicious behavior that hinted at cheating. Determined to protect the integrity of the game, Mark took it upon himself to find a way to detect Chris's cheating and ensure he was forced off the server while still adhering to the rules.

&#x200B;

Unnatural Precision: Mark closely observed Chris's gameplay, paying attention to his aiming capabilities. Chris consistently landed headshots and displayed impeccable accuracy, even under intense pressure. Mark's suspicions were further raised when Chris effortlessly eliminated enemies with inhuman precision.

&#x200B;

Instantaneous Reactions: Mark noticed that Chris reacted instantaneously to enemy movements or any unexpected events. Whether it was detecting cloaked spies, predicting incoming attacks, or quickly switching targets, Chris displayed lightning-fast reflexes that were highly suspicious.

&#x200B;

Impossible Movements: During gameplay, Mark observed Chris's movement patterns. He noticed instances where Chris moved unnaturally fast or executed impossible jumps without the use of in-game mechanics like rocket jumps. It became evident that Chris was utilizing cheat software to gain an unfair advantage.

&#x200B;

Lack of Awareness: Mark observed that Chris seemed oblivious to his surroundings. He never checked for threats or responded to team communication. It was clear that Chris was solely focused on exploiting cheats rather than engaging in fair gameplay.

&#x200B;

Despite Mark's careful observation and attempts to follow the rules, reporting Chris to the server administrators had failed to result in any action being taken. The cheater continued to ruin the gaming experience for others. Frustrated but undeterred, Mark realized he needed to think outside the box to address this persistent problem.

&#x200B;

He began reaching out to fellow players who shared his concerns about Chris's unfair gameplay. Together, they formed a dedicated group committed to fair play and maintaining a cheat-free environment.

&#x200B;

Gathering Evidence: Mark and his allies documented Chris's cheating behaviors meticulously. They captured screenshots, recorded videos, and compiled a detailed report that provided irrefutable evidence of Chris's cheating.

&#x200B;

Petitioning the Server Community: The group drafted a petition to rally support from the server community. They encouraged other players to sign the petition, expressing their dissatisfaction with the cheater's actions and urging the server administrators to take action.

&#x200B;

Publicizing the Issue: Mark and his allies shared their evidence and the petition on various gaming forums, social media platforms, and the Team Fortress 2 community hub. By spreading the word, they aimed to generate wider awareness and garner the attention of the game's developers.

&#x200B;

Reaching Out to the Developers: The group crafted a concise and compelling message outlining their concerns about Chris's cheating and the negative impact it had on the community. They sent this message directly to the developers, along with the evidence they had gathered.

&#x200B;

Their collective efforts gained momentum, capturing the attention of both the player community and the game's developers. The developers, impressed by the perseverance and commitment to fair play, took swift action. They conducted an in-depth investigation, cross-referencing the evidence provided by Mark's group.

&#x200B;

Finally, justice prevailed as the developers acknowledged the extent of Chris's cheating and implemented a permanent ban on his account. The server community celebrated the removal of the cheater, and the gaming experience returned to its fair and enjoyable state.

&#x200B;

Mark's determination to combat cheating, coupled with the power of community action and raising awareness, proved instrumental in ensuring

This is a story written with the assistance of ChatGPT to accompany the TF video in the link above. I am attempting to render NSFW scenes for the story. No promises on that, taking a lot of time.

Emily a young woman sat nervously at her desk waiting for class to end.

Her flowing, golden locks cascading down her shoulders, framed her face that exudes youthful radiance, now showing a timid nervous expression.

Her eyes, sparkling blue, windows to her soul, conveyed tension as well.

Her lips, naturally rosy and inviting, holding the promise of soft kisses and tender moments now held a vice against her complexion as she bit gently on her bottom lip. 

Her skin, fair and smooth, porcelain-like complexion, began to perspire

...

As the final bell rang Emily's fellow students dispersed, leaving Emily's heart to race with anticipation. 

She lingered behind, feigning the need for extra assistance, when in truth she had questions needing answering having nothing to with her academia.

Looking across the room Emily took in the sight of her untameable desire. 

Her Teacher Olivia.

An experienced and alluring woman, with captivating hazel eyes that hold a hint of mischief and a smile that suggests hidden desires that have been leaving Emily conflicted.

Olivia's hair shown as a stunning display of beauty and allure, cascading down her shoulders in luscious waves, flowing like silk in the gentlest breeze. Its color rich, vibrant chestnut, with hints of warmth and depth that complement her features perfectly. Each strand seems to possess a natural shine and vitality, framing her face with a captivating radiance.

Thinking back, Emily could feel during her time in Olivia's class that she had an innate ability to read others, understanding their desires and coaxing them to shed their veils of secrecy and driving them into a naked truth.

Suddenly feeling exposed in that moment Emily locked her gaze with Olivia.

Emily could feel the confidence in Olivia's eyes becomming intoxicated, drawing her to take action.

In that moment the empty classroom became a clandestine sanctuary, where hidden desires might intertwine with the scent of knowledge and the flickering of fluorescent lights.

Behind the closed classroom doors, Emily rose to meet her opportunity.

Emily's footsteps echoed softly against the tiled floor as she approached Olivia's desk. 

The air crackling with anticipation, each breath heavy with the weight of unspoken desires. The mundane reality of academia melting away, replaced by an uncharted realm of possibility and unquenchable yearning.

Olivia without a word looked at Emily with an unresistable enticing smile.

To Emily, suddenly the outside world seemed to fade into insignificance as Emily and Olivia experienced a delicate dance of power and vulnerability while she stood silently at Olivia's desk gazining into her eyes increasingly feeling overwhelmed.

Emily could bare no more and sprang over Olivia's desk with inhuman grace and strength, locking with Olivia's supple lips.

In hushed and heavy breath the two women began to tear each other's clothes off, exposing their necks and breasts, driving them to further entwine in a sensuous dance playful tongues and hungry lips.

...

For a moment both Emily and Olivia drew back to a pause in the realiazation of their predicament.

Time seemed to slow, granting them a stolen moment to chase their hidden passion and profess their desire to each other.

Each whispered confessions. 

....

Emily, driven by a deep longing and submissive nature, admited to Olivia she yearns to become her pet...her teacher's pet.

Olivia returned a knowing gaze seemed entirely unphased and just then a wicked smile of delight crept upon her face.

Olivia reached out and pulled Emily's face in closer firmly and with a touch of dominance.

The women locked lips in a passionate embrace, tongues intertwining, the taste of each other driving them into a frenzy of ecstasy. Their kisses growing more urgent and fervent with every passing moment.

The sensation of Olivia's tongue, lips, and mouth became a focal point for Emily and her overwhelming pleasure. She then began to surrender to the sensations that rippled through her being.

The air became filled with a symphony of moans and sighs, as they explore the depths of their lust with unbridled intensity.

Their hands roamed across each other's bodies, tracing every curve and contour with fervor. Fingers gliding along sensitive skin, igniting sparks of pleasure that radiate through their entwined forms. 

As their bodies entangled, their movements synchronized in a rhythm that mirrored their escalating passion. Each thrust and caress bringing them closer to the pinnacle of pleasure.

They proceeded to explore a multitude of positions, each one delivering unique sensations and depths of pleasure. From gentle and slow movements that build anticipation to faster and more intense rhythms that push them to the edge.

Their breaths became in sync with their racing hearts. Sweat glistening on their skin succumbing to the intoxication of their union both women quivered and writhed in sweet release and surrender to the euphoria washing over them, leaving them in a state of blissful ecstasy and exhaustion, leaning heavily their heads over each others shoulders clasping each other bodies serenity.

....

Their entaglement comming to a standstill,
Emily felt awash in her lustful encounter with Olivia, exhausted and somehow disappointed as magnificent as their love making was, it was not enough.

She truly wanted to be dominated by Olivia, To make Olivia her master! 

Suddenly she could feel her desires errupt, feeling her will to become submissive runing deep in her veins and heart, coursing to her skin, becomming warmer by the second. 

Her skin began to writhe and her body became wrought with inexplecable pleasure as a change she had never know before began to takeover.

Emily shuddering with delight trembling stumbling backwards fell atop Olivia's desk.

Olivia's stunned eyes watched closely as Emily fell prey to metamorphosis. 

Unwilling to move Emily started noticing changes in her surroundings of the college classroom.

The room had come alive with vibrant colors and textures. Sunlight streamed through the windows, casting playful patterns on the walls, while the sound of rustling papers and soft whispers of students envelop the air, creating a bustling atmosphere she could hear in  distant rooms.

She felt the coolness of the Olivia's desk against her body and transforming limbs, the gentle breeze brushing against her shifting hair, and the subtle scent of ink and paper lingering in the air. 

Emily's body became an otherworldly  symphony of sensations. The tingling warmth spreading through her veins, a pulsating life force that she felt resonating  deep within her. 

She felt the world around her beginning to grow larger and felt her form become progressively more delicate and smaller. While soft fur began to envelop her skin feeling like a caress, each individual hair a whisper against her senses. 

A tail began to form at the base of her spine twitching. Her fingers began to exude claws, flexing as they retracted and extended uncontrollably. 

Baring witness and mesmerized by Emily's transformation, Olivia found herself captivated by the alluring changes taking place. 

Feeling a primal lust Olivia went to her lover guiding her hands over her shifting body. 

Her touch sending electric currents of pleasure rippling through Emily's body as her hands glided across her fur and contours of femine and feline shape. 

Olivia noted Emily's beautiful soft ears atop her head and could not resist but lean close over her and gently nibble their tips, causing Emily to moan in an inhuman low sensuous grumble.

For a moment Emily locked gazes with Olivia admist her course of pleasure and metamorphosis, seeming to slow her change in that instant.

...

Now Emily was only slightly larger than half her original size the transformation taking pause, as if to give her a moment of clarity and break the cloud of ecstasy roiling in her mind. Every sensation Olivia had bestowed upon her magnified far beyond their previous intercourse nowhere comparable to her fading human form.

Emily could feel the warmth of Olivia's breath against her skin and fur, the gentle pressure of her hands against her hips, began to cause a resurgence of change as she cried out to, ""Olivia make me yours!""

Olivia felt a rush of emboldened desire, positioning herself between Emily's trembling legs, her lips eagerly pressing against the intimate folds of her diminutive womanhood.

With skilled and deliberate movements,  Olivia's tongue coursed along the sensitive skin, tracing every contour and teasingly exploring each delicate fold of Emily's vagina. She savored the taste and scent of Emily's arousal, immersing herself in the growing intensity of the moment.

The overwhelming euphoria began to take hold of Emily once more, causing her to lose control of her pause in metamorphosis.

She continued to become smaller and more feline in every second.

Olivia's head became wrapped by Emily's legs by the narrowing of delicate her hips.

Shrinking further, Emily's heightened sensations continued to amplify, the pleasure coursing through her body. Every flick and caress of the Olivia's tongue became a symphony of ecstasy, sending shivers of delight through her diminishing form. 

Olivia realizing gasps in her mind that lover is shrinking still. 

Not wanting to deny an ounce of euphoria  her oral ministrations became more fervent, driven by a hunger to please and satisfy her shrinking lover.

With each passing second, Emily's sensation intensified. Emily began to climax, gasping for breath, as her final moment of ultimate release edge closer, feeling her womanhood quiver with uncontrollable delight, she let out a primal moan of pleasure echoing through the room. 

Olivia steped back from Emily, her senses momentarily overwhelmed, she takes a moment to catch her breath and compose herself. 

Her eyes, dark with desire, gaze upon Emily, resting atop her desk, suddenly confronted with the embodiment of Emily's sensual allure in this feline form. 

Olivia's surprise quickly gives way to a profound curiosity.

Olivia's eyes trace the contours of Emily's feline body, admiring the supple grace with which she moves and the mesmerizing gaze that holds hints of the woman she once was. 

The air began to crackle with a new energy, an epihany of the transcesion these two lovers presented through breaking the boundaries of the human experience.

Olivia felt herself still further conflicted with the tantalizing possibility of exploring the depths of her desires beyond the confines of traditional human connection. 

She pondered Emily's alluring feline form, with its inherent sensuality and enigmatic nature, becoming a canvas upon which Olivia's own desires and boundaries will be tested.

Now Emily's feline eyes meet Olivia's, a silent understanding passed between them—a recognition of the transformative power of desire and the intoxicating blend of vulnerability and power that exists within their connection.

I’m an HR generalist at a tech company in the Bay Area. Graduated with my bachelors in hr management and a minor in psych. I have 4 years of HR experience, 5 if you count my internship and HR student assistant job in college.

For context, I am a pretty big procrastinator. I think my poor cramming habits in college reinforced my belief I can get things done last minute lol. 

Studying experience:
Bought the SHRM learning system back in early 2022. Started off strong studying, taking notes and outlining everything via hand. Realized how slow I was going and started making quizlet flash cards… even then I felt like I wasn’t absorbing information in the way I wanted. Anyway I would be pretty inconsistent about studying, would read every now and then and just do the quizzes. I think for 8 months I completed only like 20% of the learning system (I wasn’t in a rush because I had access to the system thru august 2023).  Realized I wasn’t motivated because I didn’t have a deadline so decide to schedule my exam in June. I didn’t really take my studies seriously until 2 months before the exam. Kinda stressed because I was traveling a lot and prioritized going to music festivals lol. But I take the weekends to kinda cram and do the quizzes. Post EDC I’m like ok I gotta get my shit together. I finish the SHRM learning system and have 2 weeks to review. I take the post test and score a 75%. Kinda stressed because I know I needed an 80% to qualify as passing… 
I totally zone in on my studies, averaging 12-15 hours fri-sun, doing practice tests and really following up on information that I got wrong in the textbook. I would do flash cards when I didn’t wanna sit at my desk or when I would go to the park I’d sit on the grass and review my notes. Tried to spice it up cos I was going crazy.

Day before/Exam day:
The night before my exam I made sure I got my 8 hours of sleep. I’m so glad I did because I was def able to focus better during the situational judgment tests, I have the attention span of a toddler lol. The exam is actually a lot easier than the SHRM learning system and I would finish each section with at least 30 min to spare. Def don’t spend too much time on one question and leverage the highlight and strike thru feature! It helped me so much.

I submit my exams feelin pretty confident, got the pass and hallelujah Im so happy to get back to my social life lol.

Here are my tips:
- if you can afford it, buy the SHRM learning system
- if not, I recommend buying a bunch of practice tests and using other peoples quizlets - there’s a ton that take the material off the learning system 
- take a frickton of practice tests/questions 
- follow up on questions you got wrong in the text book
- chatgpt also helped me understand the rationale behind MC answers when I would get it wrong LOL mvp!!
- try to understand why something is the best answer
- some helpful tips for process of elimination:
O strike out the obvious wrong answers so you aren’t distracted by them 
O ask if that choice creates risk for the company, if it does, it’s prob not it 
O read the question carefully, I noticed a lot of questions would ask for the “first thing” to do- which is almost always try to learn more about the situation at hand. In other words don’t jump the gun to implement the solution yet, try to get the full picture

You got this!! I would get so nervous but I reminded myself that the drive to the exam is more dangerous than the exam itself lol. And if you fail you just study again and take it again. If anything, taking it twice reinforces your knowledge and you prob know the material better than someone who passed it on their first try. Thanks for reading my stream of consciousness this far and feel free to ask me anything! I want to help:)"

149bpkb,45,2023-06-14,"Why DO the devs seem averse to having (mostly male) main characters show up on Summer banners, their most valuable yearly event?",u/AstralComet,FireEmblemHeroes,https://www.reddit.com/r/FireEmblemHeroes/comments/149bpkb/why_do_the_devs_seem_averse_to_having_mostly_male/,"**Edit:** I regret putting ""mostly male"" in the title since that seems to be what everyone is focusing on, I'm moreso talking about how they usually treat summer like any other seasonal banner; a mix of main characters, popular characters, and nobodies, when the Byleth banner and last year's Lordapolooza should have shown IS that putting their most popular characters in summer sells *really well.* Original post continues below:

That meme from the other day got me thinking; we all know how lucrative summer is, and yet for some reason, IS seems intent on avoiding the most popular characters in the summer for the most part. It seems like only recently have they realized that “oh, Lords in the summer will sell!” Look at past years, with the majorly-popular characters **bolded** (warning, subjective):

**2017**

**Ylissean Summer**

**F!Robin, A!Tiki,** Gaius, Frederick

Two fairly heavy hitters in F!Robin and A!Tiki, a medium one in Gaius (who never again got an alt) and Frederick, who is also there.

**Nohrian Summer**

**Leo, F!Corrin, Xander, Elise**

An actual heavy-hitter banner, with the Nohrian royals save Camilla, and the more popular version of Corrin.

**2018**

**Summer’s Arrival**

**Cordelia,** Noire, Innes, Tana

Just Cordelia. Noire is there for booba, and while Innes and Tana are popular relative to the SS characters, they’re not overall.

**A Sketchy Summer**

Linde, **Y!Tiki, Takumi, Camilla**

Again, more Fates royals are sure to sell, and it’s two of the more popular ones, alongside Y!Tiki who is a decently big deal.

**2019**

**Summer Returns**

Helbindi, **Gunnthra, Laegjarn, Laevatein,** Ylgr (TT)

OCs, but as we’ve learned OCs actually sell, even though the three older gals seem to be the *really* popular characters on the banner.

**Summer Refreshes**

Wolt, Ursula, Lilina, **Lyn,**, Fiora (TT)

Real weird one, apparently Lyn was supposed to hard carry the banner.

**2020**

**Summer Passing**

**Mia and “Marth”,** Joshua, Lute, Selena, Rhys (TT)

Again, taking Farfetched Heroes long after their popularity cooled and making them a summer banner was weird, and so is Mia and Marth.

**Overseas Memories**

**Byleth and Rhea, Sylvain,** Ingrid, **Dorothea,** Lorenz (TT)

Now *here’s* a big banner, but again there’s only one main character present, IS seemed to be getting the idea that you should use your big names for this.

**2021**

**Summer Vibrance**

**Hilda and Marianne,** Ashe, Caspar, Mercedes, Leonie (TT)

… And then they didn’t continue it the next year, with Hilda and Marianne very popular, flanked by other students who are… there.

**Summer’s Dream**

Caeda and Plumeria, **Freyja,** Ogma, Freyr, Norne (TT)

A real mystery, this one. Again, was Freyja supposed to hard-carry like Lyn?

**2022**

**Summer Vacation**

**Edelgard** and Altina, **Claude, Dimitri, Micaiah, Elincia** (TT)

Once again, IS seems to have realized main characters sell, and we get a summer banner with all Lords, *finally.*

**Taken by the Tide**

**Thorr and Loki,** Nifl, **Eirika, Lyon**, Seth (TT)

And they continue it, following things up with another big-seller with our vivacious duo goddesses, as well as Eirika and Lyon.

… Out of sixty-two summer Heroes so far, there are thirty who I wouldn’t consider “banner sellers” on any level, and of those sixty-two only eighteen are main characters, with *seven* from just last summer. Before last summer, we had 50+ summer Heroes, and only eleven were main characters, barely than a fifth.

Do we think it’s IS trying to space out their big sellers, or something? Just off the top of my mind; surely Summer Marth, Alm, Celica, Roy, Eliwood, Hector, Ninian, Ephraim, Ike, Chrom, Lucina, Azura, Yuri, F!Shez, and male Robin, Corrin, and Byleth would sell great, but IS seems like they’re trying hard to avoid big sellers and instead go for the supporting casts.

I’m sure fans of minor characters are ecstatic to see them in a seasonal alt, but it just feels strange “wasting” a lucrative summer alt on Noire, or Rhys, or Norne, or Ogma.

Again, maybe IS *is* learning that major characters sell; considering how 2022 shaped up, but it really seems like it undulates between major characters and supporting casts. 2017 was also mostly main characters, 2018 was half-and-half, and then 2019, 2020, and 2021 were *rough* with one major draw on each banner and then mostly supporting characters, with the F!Byleth and Hilda banners as the only big exceptions.

How do you feel? Do you want IS to go back to supporting casts, with a single Lord or main character as a “draw,” or would you like to see more ala 2022, with a full-Lord banner and then another one with two main characters on it as well?"

Hello everyone, 

PBTS broke through resistance yesterday afternoon and moved up **3.5%** only to be sold off and close down **1.8%** on the day. The overall markets may dictate how this trades today as we await the FOMC's interest rate decision.

**PBTS is a NASDAQ company that has been making very big moves to get into China’s immense A.I. space!**

The AI race is here. Tech giants, cloud titans, and chipmakers are all scrambling to get an edge in the AI future.

The transition to AI could last decades upon decades as the world moves into this advanced era.

Recently OpenAI’s ChatGPT has been showing just how far “generative AI” can go and has been widely buzzing on Wall Street.

As the conversation about AI gets even louder, finding exciting growth stories in the financial markets has become a priority!

**This puts the spotlight on Powerbridge Technologies Co., Ltd. (PBTS), a little-known NASDAQ company that could make a big splash in China’s AI boom!**

**A big acquisition…**

**It was only in April that PBTS announced that the company has** [**acquired a 90%**](https://tradersnewssource.us3.list-manage.com/track/click?u=3a207043349295e229010b31c&id=a779b8d330&e=ebc86f89b1) **stake in Ascendent Insights Education Co., Ltd. (""AIedu""), an AI education service company.**  
This move is part of the company’s strategy to expand its presence in the education industry and leverage AIedu's expertise to further improve its offerings.

AIedu is an AI education service company with more than 400,000 users and over 20,000 reading materials. AIedu serves over 4,000 nurseries and kindergartens with 40,000 educators, providing an innovative approach to early childhood education through its use of AI technology.  
Its flagship product, Little Egg, has received positive feedback from parents and educators alike for its ability to provide a personalized learning experience for each student.

The acquisition of AIedu will enable **PBTS** to integrate ChatGPT into its existing education offerings, one of the key drivers of growth for the Company.

ChatGPT is a game-changing product in early childhood education that provides a personalized learning experience for students.

**The integration of ChatGPT into PBTS’s existing education offerings is expected to create substantial benefits for the Company, including expanded market opportunities, a larger user base, and** **increased revenue streams!**

Stewart Lor, CEO of Powerbridge Technologies, commented: ""The acquisition of AIedu is an exciting step forward as the Company continues to innovate and bring cutting-edge technology services to the education industry. With our focus on personalized learning experiences for preschool children, we are well-positioned to tap into this growing market and drive future growth for our shareholders.""

China’s education market is massive.

China's education technology market entered a stage of rapid growth from 2017 to 2020, with the total revenue of the industry increasing from $46.4 billion to $61.1 billion, with a compound [annual growth rate of 9.6%.](https://tradersnewssource.us3.list-manage.com/track/click?u=3a207043349295e229010b31c&id=0b9d27b48a&e=ebc86f89b1)

China itself is massive. China is the world's No. 2 economy and home to dozens of amazing companies that trade in the U.S. Right now. This includes giants like Alibaba Group Holding (BABA) and Trip.com (TCOM) whose market caps are over $200 and $20B respectively.

**A China comeback….**

While it’s been a tough couple of years for the country’s economy with the pandemic and regulatory crackdowns, China is still a powerhouse.

There are high anticipations that the country will see **a major rebound** going forward, especially as tech crackdowns have eased and the country climbs out of its zero-Covid policy.  
Investors split on the Chinese market or standing on the sidelines could be missing out on some of *the biggest opportunities at supreme value right now!*

Many companies are employing artificial intelligence in various ways. Tech companies use it to make their existing operations more powerful while other companies are focused on robotics, self-driving cars, and virtual assistants.

With artificial intelligence, companies are pushing for innovation and testing the limits of how AI can be used in everyday life.

**AI is just one of the exciting and growing industries that Powerbridge Technologies Co., Ltd. (PBTS) is invested…**

**Additional Segments**

**Powerbridge Technologies Co., Ltd. (Nasdaq: PBTS)** is a leading provider of multi-industry technology solutions. The Company offers software and platform applications, IoT platform services and intelligent devices, supply chain platforms and interactive media services, metaverse and digital services, and cryptocurrency asset operations and services.

The company has made significant investments in SaaS, ePlatforms, and Smart Devices for global trade, travel and leisure, education, and digital assets, with a base that now spans a broad range of clients from global trade and cross-border participants to retail customers and educators.

Other recent moves from **PBTS** include the company’s acquisition of a majority stake in several high-growth technology companies, its strategic engagement in AI and Blockchain technology companies, and its development of metaverse and NFT solutions targeting multiple industries.  
Just a few weeks ago **PBTS** also announced its [recent acquisition](https://tradersnewssource.us3.list-manage.com/track/click?u=3a207043349295e229010b31c&id=63d414766c&e=ebc86f89b1) of 1,200 units of A1346 Avalon Bitcoin Miners. The investment aligns with the Company's long-term strategy in the crypto market.

The A1346 Avalon Bitcoin Miners with a hash rate of 104TH/s, are known for their high performance, stability, and ease of use. This investment could help the company expand its presence in the crypto market.

149f65b,1,2023-06-14,School Teacher help: Any way to get around memory limits for a teacher making end of year quizzes?,u/trickyfurball,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/149f65b/school_teacher_help_any_way_to_get_around_memory/,"Hi everyone! I'm a teacher who relies on Chat GPT to create quizzes for my students. Currently, I'm working on an ""end of class"" comprehensive quiz that encompasses content from seven smaller courses we've covered. The total text length for the quiz amounts to approximately 87,000 words.

The challenge I'm facing involves creating a complex prompt (**1026 words or 5879 characters)**. I want the prompt to generate a specific number of questions of a certain type while also referencing the corresponding reading materials. However, due to the prompt's length and the size of the 87,000-word text, I've encountered difficulties in getting Chat GPT or the playground to remember crucial elements. I even attempted to feed it only 1000 characters at a time, but that approach disrupts the necessary pattern for the overall output.

I recently came across the ""chatgpt-retrieval-plugin"" from OpenAI, which seems promising. Additionally, I've heard suggestions about utilizing embeddings and a vector database to resolve this issue, but I'm unsure where to begin. Am I overthinking it and there's a way to do it outside of spinning up a vector database and doing a bunch of terminal stuff? I'm not tooooo techical but enough to be capable. I have API access, and budget is not a concern when it comes to using it.

Do any of you have any tips or recommendations on how to tackle this challenge effectively? Thank you in advance!  


BTW: I allow my students to use chatGPT - i think it's important for them to learn about LLMs and AI. This is just me doing the same thing I allow them to - to better understand it"

149kjej,18,2023-06-14,Medical Students in Albania Face Unjust Restrictions and Exorbitant Fees!,u/unimportantsarcasm,medicalschoolEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschoolEU/comments/149kjej/medical_students_in_albania_face_unjust/,"Hey, fellow medical students of r/medicalschoolEU,

I'm reaching out to share a grave situation that we, as medical students in Albania, are currently facing. University life here has become increasingly challenging and frustrating due to a lack of resources and absentee professors. The repercussions of these circumstances have led to a surge in the number of students opting to pursue specialization in other countries after completing their general medicine degrees.

However, our government has recently devised a new plan that poses a severe threat to our dreams and aspirations. According to this plan, once we finish medical school, we will be required to pay a staggering $5,000 USD per year if we choose to leave Albania for further specialization. Alternatively, we can pay the usual fee of $450, but we will be obligated to work as doctors in Albania for three years without being allowed to practice in any other country.

This plan has not yet been officially announced and remains unknown to the general public. It is crucial for us, the medical students, to unite and take a stand against these unjust measures before they are implemented.

We are already dealing with inadequate academic resources, uncommitted professors, and a system that hinders our growth and opportunities. Now, this new policy threatens to restrict our future prospects and limit our ability to seek advanced medical education abroad. It not only undermines our freedom but also burdens us with an exorbitant financial burden.

**Let's discuss and brainstorm effective ways to protest against this plan.** We could organize peaceful demonstrations, write letters to government officials and medical organizations, or launch social media campaigns to draw attention to our cause. Additionally, if any of you have experience in activism or have successfully navigated similar challenges, please share your insights and advice with us.

&#x200B;

Our united efforts can make a difference and compel our government to reconsider this unjust policy. Remember, this issue affects not only current medical students but also the future of medical education in Albania.

&#x200B;

My English is not that good, so I explained the exact situation to ChatGPT and had it write this. Please know that everything stated is true.   
I would love to hear your thoughts on this.

**This is mostly directed toward EU Med Students. I would like to hear about your politics, how much you pay, is this fair in your opinion or not, etc.**   


**Thanks**"

149z9wi,0,2023-06-15,Potential of Artificial Intelligence in India,u/Rabbidraccoon18,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/149z9wi/potential_of_artificial_intelligence_in_india/,"I would like to hear your opinions on the future of India in relation to artificial intelligence. Do you believe that India can develop its own AI system that can compete with the leading ones such as chatGPT, Google Bard and Microsoft's Bing AI? I firmly believe that India has the potential to create an AI system that is not only comparable but superior to the existing ones. This can also boost the economy by creating more jobs and introducing new kinds of professions that we have never imagined before. Furthermore, if we integrate our AI with our technology, we could achieve unprecedented levels of innovation and excellence. Imagine all the wonderful things we could accomplish.

According to various estimates, AI can increase India's annual growth rate by **1.3 percentage points** by 2035. AI can benefit Indian society and economy in many ways, such as:

- Reducing human-intensive labour by leveraging on smart automation
- Increasing efficiency in pharma and healthcare industry
- Transforming the financial sector
- Quicker and easier customer service using AI chat-bots
- Enhancing safety on roads
- Predicting and enabling quicker response to disaster

AI can also improve the quality and access of education in India, which is a key factor for social development and empowerment. AI can help in designing personalized learning paths, providing adaptive feedback, creating immersive learning environments, and facilitating peer-to-peer learning. AI can also help in addressing the challenges of teacher shortage, student dropout, and learning outcomes.

AI is not only a technology but also a vision for India's future. It is a vision that is grounded in the fundamental rights afforded to citizens by the Constitution and guided by the principles of responsible AI for all. It is a vision that aims to solve the pressing problems faced by millions of Indians and create a more inclusive, prosperous, and sustainable society. I think we have the capacity to produce something remarkable. India has so many talented and intelligent people who can make this vision a reality by creating an AI system that is unparalleled.

Any non standard ones welcome - bonus if it's free :)

Obviously ChatGPT is already in the list, and basic stuff like quizzes that auto mark students answers are plentiful, but does anyone have a recommendation for something else that might be really useful?"
14a3zku,9,2023-06-15,ChatGPT / OpenAI Programs in the Library,u/Embarrassed_Swim1717,librarians,https://www.reddit.com/r/librarians/comments/14a3zku/chatgpt_openai_programs_in_the_library/,"Hello-

My Youth Services librarian has a contact with a tech nonprofit who is hosting Open AI & Bitcoin informational session for adults. The host has also mentioned they'd like to do similar programming for children & teens. I'm apprehensive, mainly because I just left the education field and had issue with students plagiarizing (which is a long-standing issue, unfortunately; from books to Wikipedia, it's always been a concern). However, I do think things like Chatgpt can be useful in the classroom, and we have a lot of homeschool students who I'd think would benefit from using the program. 

I suppose my general question is, when trying to set up a programming event for AI tech, what kinds of questions are important outside of ""how to use AI ethically"" and ""how not to plagiarize."" I don't want to seem to teach-y in my programming, but I do think it'd be beneficial. Has anyone hosted programs about OpenAI/ChatGPT? If so, how did it go and do you have any suggestions? If not, are there any other concerns you have about this type of program? 

Thanks"

https://preview.redd.it/3pua1pqioc6b1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9841b4d12066173c223b7546c55033348ba8f0fd

Let's summarize why faking your magic is such a horrible crime.

A crime that dominates all systems. It can't help but do that.

They ""resolve"" that by having an authority at the top, to endorse the ""winners"".

Those who's pretending is certified to be the real thing, so now they can take to their little throne, and lord it over whatever franchise they can put together.

And they're endorsed for life, if they just keep sending headquarters a cut.

I studied Zen under a man like that. Famous for running one of the first Zen franchises in the USA.

The temple in Los Angeles.

His ""wise words"" to monks, who went so far as to shave their heads in order to seek as much attention as possible, were ""Don't expect to fly to the sun!""

Well, shit. 

I just got back from there.

It's lovely this time of year.

His prep for new students was to tell them it's wise to lower your expectations.

But didn't the Buddha reach fame because of his amazing powers?  Otherwise, who would listen to a guy who sits around all day with his eyes closed, doing nothing?

Certainly not sorcerers. They're famous for running around all over the mountains, keeping their bodies in strong shape.

As you get older you realize that if you sit around all the time, pretty soon you have ""old man legs"".

It is NOT wise to be inactive!

It's also not wise to relax all the time. I mean, to hold up as the ideal that our body is 100% relaxed, like a Tai Chi master.

That's just more show biz.

Bad advice.

You find that out, as you do more and more tensegrity, and the results are not only visible but turn out to contain ""principles"".

Gestures you learn you can make, which produce a visible ripple in space.

They disturb the alignment of the emanations and then a flux is created.  To resolve that disturbance.

Purple and pink will ripple out from the location of the disturbance, and that ""intent changing"" vapor can be used to open doorways to other worlds.

Or to heal I presume.

To do just about anything, that sorcerers discovered that movement could do.

A very good example is Zuleica's pass.

It's filled with gestures that produce ripples of visible magic.

Now, I had my allies taken away.  

By who or what, I have no idea.

I just know, Cholita had an old woman with her, and while in the second attention, fully awake but having ""switched over"" to that realm, the old woman told me I was overusing them and ""they"" were taking them away.

Cholita had been complaining about it for months, so it wasn't surprising.  That and, I'm too fat.

But them being gone gave me a chance to see what was ""under"" what I had been looking at.

An analogy.  You have an annoying little pet.

I feel bad for pets.  We essentially pulled them out of their natural environment, bred them to be pleasing to humans, unable to survive alone, and then we kept them prisoner for our amusement.

But we don't have to feel entirely at fault for that.

It was done to us.  Living in rooms all day,  never exploring the unknown.

We went mad.

So the pets and us are in the same boat.

But for the sake of this analogy, assume the pet is like an inorganic being.  

Of course, the opposite is likely true. We're pets to the inorganic beings.

But your cat thinks the same. He's got you feeding him for free!

You work for him.

I've been told dogs are the same.  They don't really subjugate themselves to the family.

They believe they're at the top of the pecking order.

And everything goes fine, until you have 3 or more dogs in which case you become somewhat irrelevant, as they fight it out among themselves for top dog.

But for an analogy, the inorganic beings are like a ""yoga cat"", who can't resist when you are doing your bending exercises and runs over to get itself into the bendy mix.

Or to sit on your keyboard as you try to use your computer at home.

It just ""shows up"" because you're doing something interesting.

Or, it looks like you've gone out to lunch staring at that weird box we call a monitor.

And when you successfully create a ripple of colored light in space,  an IOB is likely to run over like a cat and superimpose itself on the action.

They block your view of the monitor, and make it impossible to use the keyboard.

They're great for helping to move the assemblage point, because instead of a vague pink cloud being generated by the tensegrity movement gesture, you can make out a face.

It's a pattern with higher familiar information content.

I've been sent datasheets on the latest AI chips, with people in China interested in whether I can duplicate the power of those, in a form the US government will allow for export.

The most powerful chips I saw are made by NVidia, at TMSC in Taiwan.  Next in line is AMD, and somewhere down at the bottom is a microcontroller maker, who has $50 microcomputer chips for ""edge AI"".  For little monitor devices, or even toys, that run about in the real world doing small tasks.

I've been trying to understand what they do.

The approach they take is not at all what I would have done. I would simply have simulated real neural networks, created software to design ""blobs"" out of them and let people design blobs which do things.  And share the ""things"" people created. Connect the ""eyes"" someone made, to the ""ears"". Maybe even make a famous star wars ""motivator"".

The problem there is the massive amount of memory needed, and massive processor power to actually duplicate what the human neural net does.

And when I heard it takes thousands of super fast small CPUS a full year to process ChatGPT's database, to make ""it"", I realized someone had figured out that your neural net is mostly not creating useful output.

It's just a gigantic collection of tiny bits of information sucked out of space and stored into a matrix, where ""emergent properties"" can be used at the outputs because all of the infomation is designed to ripple downstream, combined with nearly random bits of other information being sucked up at the same time.

So that if you have the database of all text man has ever produced, you can train an AI with it.

But what that really seems to mean is, you run vector oriented algorithms on it  until you extract the useful neural path ways.  And toss out the rest.

The cream of the crop from all the chaos of that huge database.

So that at the end, it's possible to sort through only the ""useful"" part of a virtual neural network of much larger size.

You reduce all that data to the key pathways.

I might be wrong, but it seems to be what those modern chips work on.

Or to put it more simply, ""Chocolate"" in your hands sends information into your eyes, nose, and  temperature sensors. That feeds into the neural net, and if it leads to an output that requires enough sights and smells and feelings to be verified as chocolate, you get the chocolate signal output.

But what's the relationship to sorcery?

It's those emanations.

You send awareness (information) into them, and they light up like a neural net.  Causing other pathways to light up.

The result is that a final conclusion comes into focus.

It's chocolate!

Or it's a hot car.

Or too spooky to enter that mansion.

It's a piece of ""reality"".

We're so lost in those that we aren't even aware this is going on. That we're being presented with a constant flow of conclusions and live inside that, trying to influence what conclusions are drawn next.

Sorcerers realized you can step out of that, and there's 20,000 alternate conclusions for any given depth of the assemblage point.

The problem is, that's ludicrous.

To think that the place you are currently struggling in could go away in an instant and you could be somewhere else.

But it's a fact!  And that's what we're trying to witness.

There's the annoying problem that we've associated ourselves with some elements of this fixed reality.

Physical matter and an organic body.

And most of ""us"", the parts we know, is created in that mess of conclusions.

That mess actually exists, at this precise position of the assemblage point.

It's what this ""skimming"" looks like.

Your awareness doesn't have to be stuck here.

But you can't say, ""I love this huge boulder.  I think I'll take it with me when I rematerialize in another reality.""

The boulder belongs to here.  Here is what makes it.

You can't insist it has to come with you to ""there"".

So sorcerers are always stuck with that nagging ultimate problem of, being tied to their organic bodies.

There's various ways they get around that such as burying themselves, ""shrinking"" the tonal, and so on.

Stuff it's not good to think about at all, because it's just a lame story until you do it.

And when you do it, you won't be able to ""prove it"" to anyone.

You just do it.  Then later it makes no sense that it even happened.

Darkroom will lead to that, once you get the ""gestures"" down.

So we just need to concentrate on ""real effects"" instead of all the thinking and pretending and believing you need to relax all the time, or be saintly all the time, or seek the endorsement of the head guy so he can distinguish your pretending from all the new people who are pretending just as well as you.

We try to fight off that flood of pretending in here, and concentrate on real effects.

And Zuleica's pass is loaded with little gestures or movements, which cause ripples in the skimmed emanations.

Once you master  it, you can extract them.

The circular flip of the wrist creates a ball of color light, spinning through space.

If it hits anything, it expands.

But if you gaze and follow it in the air, it tunnels into space creating a hole.

Through which you can go, if you have learned how to do that.

Don Juan was filled with such gestures.  And someone brainwashed with fake magic will be surprised.

He doesn't relax to use them.

He uses muscles as much as his gaze. Or his hand.

He might have learned it's easier to produce that ripple in the emanations, if you squint your eyes and turn up your nose.  Gesticulate.

But since it's real magic and you aren't trying to impress the groupies, there's no reason to feel bad about using your body in whatever manner makes the gesture effect more vivid.

When Carlos designed the tensegrity, he wanted us to notice the effects.

But it didn't do any good. We didn't.

He started to ""streamline"" them so they had just the principles. The minimal gestures.

""Gift to Maui"" used to unscrew the hatch 6 times. He was hoping we'd visibly see what that does.

It was reduced to 2, for the video version which is stellar hatch.

Two is more than enough, if you can visibly see what it does.  You created that ripple in reality.

Six is for beginners, hoping they'll notice.

It's the essence of what the pass is trying to teach.

Kind of like the huge database, processed for a full year by thousands of super fast computers, to save up just the ""good stuff"".

Most likely Tensegrity moves, many of which came from the death defier, were really just the gesture part.

The movement that creates a useful ripple in space, which can be applied for specific purposes.

But when put together as a ""system"", another property emerges from the giant database of tensegrity moves.

Seeing.

You realize what it takes to get each tensegrity gesture to make visible ripples of energy.

And then, you don't need moves at all.

We saw that result in Carlos, in person.

He'd be gazing off into space, blankly, very much like that last post of mine with a woman staring off into space, looking for dreams to form in the colors she found swirling in the air.

Slowly swirling I ought to add for beginners. 

It's very vague most of the time.

But by shutting off the internal dialogue so that you aren't forcing yourself back to your normal reality you can pick up little dreams in the air, and even enter them.

Or get answers.

Carlos tried to teach us by watching those in the air, and then either repeating them to us, or altering his teaching path based on what he just ""saw"".

The witches did that too.

I confused their searching for ""seeing answers"" for not being willing to speak when Carlos tossed the ball to them.

I got distracted by the cat on the keyboard.  Blocking my view of what was really going on."

My instructor just responded with “whatever passes is best.” I feel like any other college python instructor would give a few minutes to assist a student with how they could improve their code.

[Google](https://www.worldmagzine.com/artificial-intelligence/indian-software-zoho-is-now-working-on-llm-along-with-openai-and-google/) and OpenAI are talking about arrangements to pay distributors over utilizing content to prepare generative computer-based intelligence models.

The [world](https://www.worldmagzine.com/world/)‘s greatest tech organizations are in conversation with driving news sources to hammer out milestone agreements over the utilization of information content to prepare man-made consciousness innovation.

### Google and Open AI were Discussing the Agreements

OpenAI, Google,[ Microsoft](https://www.worldmagzine.com/technology/us-ftc-wants-to-block-microsoft-activision-blizzard-now/), and Adobe have met news leaders lately to examine copyright issues around their man-made intelligence items, for example, text chatbots and picture generators, as per a few groups acquainted with the discussions.

These individuals said that distributors including News Corp, Axel Springer, The New York Times and The Gatekeeper have each been in conversations with no less than one of the tech organizations.

Those engaged with the conversations, which stay in the beginning phases, added that the arrangements could include media associations being paid a membership style charge for their substance to foster the innovation supporting chatbots like OpenAI’s [ChatGPT](https://www.worldmagzine.com/artificial-intelligence/university-exam-was-cleared-by-a-student-with-chatgpt-bot/) and Google’s Versifier.

The discussions come as media bunches express worry over the danger to the business presented by the ascent of computer-based intelligence, as well as fears over the utilization of their substance by OpenAI and Google without bargains set up. A few organizations, for example, Security man-made intelligence and OpenAI are confronting lawful activity from craftsmen, photograph offices, and coders, who charge legally binding and copyright encroachment.

An arrangement would set the outline for news associations in their dealings with generative [artificial intelligence](https://www.worldmagzine.com/artificial-intelligence/) organizations around the world.

Media industry leaders need to keep away from the missteps of the early web period when many offered articles online with the expectation of complimentary that eventually sabotaged their plans of action.

Large Tech gatherings, for example, Google and [Facebook](https://www.worldmagzine.com/technology/now-trump-got-the-access-to-use-his-facebook-and-instagram-accounts/) then, at that point, got to that data to assist with building multibillion-dollar web-based publicizing organizations.

As the notoriety of generative artificial intelligence has developed, so have the news [business](https://www.worldmagzine.com/business/)‘ interests, provided the innovation’s capacity to create persuading areas regarding the human-like text.

* Google as of late declared a generative inquiry capability, which returns a computer-based intelligence-composed data box over its conventional configuration of web joins.
* It has been sent off to the US and is preparing for discharge around the world.
* A few conversations presently include attempting to find a valuing model for news content utilized as preparing information for man-made intelligence models.
* One number that had been examined by distributors is $5mn-$20mn every year, as indicated by an industry chief.

Google has been driving the exchanges with UK media sources, meeting the Gatekeeper and NewsUK. The Letters in Order possessed organization has long-running organizations with numerous media associations to utilize information from content, for example, articles to guarantee showing up in its web crawler is improved. The organization has utilized the information to prepare its enormous language models, as indicated by two individuals acquainted with the game plan.

Since sending off ChatGPT in November, OpenAI boss Sam Altman has met News Corp and The New York Times, as per individuals acquainted with the conversations. The organization recognized it had held chats with distributors and distributed relationships all over the planet on how they could cooperate.

Fostering a monetary model for the utilization of information content to prepare simulated intelligence will be incredibly troublesome, as indicated by distributing pioneers. Senior chiefs at one significant US distributor said the news business was working retroactively because tech organizations had sent off these items without talking with them.

Adobe’s model is prepared on pictures in its library of stock pictures, as well as straightforwardly authorized and public area content where the copyright has terminated. Narayen said customized arrangements and estimating would rely upon the organization, yet clients could add their restrictive substance to the instrument.

Axel Springer’s Döpfner communicated idealism that arrangements would be reached because the two media associations and policymakers have gotten a handle on the size of the test more rapidly than during the last huge influx of [mechanical](https://www.worldmagzine.com/technology/check-your-internal-parts-in-virtual-call-through-mechanical-pill/) interruption.

ChatGPT:

In the realm of Xinxia, where ancient traditions and mystical energies intertwined, the practice of cultivation was a revered art. It was said that those who dedicated themselves to the path of cultivation could tap into the depths of their inner power and attain incredible abilities.

Among the villagers of Xinxia, there lived a young man named Wu Kang. He possessed a strong spirit and an unwavering determination to explore the boundless possibilities of cultivation. From a young age, he had heard tales of legendary cultivators who could control the elements, heal the wounded, and transcend the limits of ordinary existence.

Inspired by these stories, Wu Kang set out on a journey to seek a renowned master who could guide him on the path of cultivation. After days of traveling through treacherous mountains and dense forests, he arrived at the hidden abode of Master Li Shou.

Master Li Shou was a wise and patient teacher, known for his profound knowledge of cultivation and his ability to unlock the hidden potential within his disciples. Wu Kang became his devoted student, eagerly soaking up the teachings and diligently practicing the cultivation techniques.

Days turned into weeks, weeks into months, and months into years as Wu Kang delved deeper into the art of cultivation. He learned to harness his breath, channel his energy, and cultivate his spirit to awaken the dormant power within him.

Under the guidance of Master Li Shou, Wu Kang underwent arduous training, pushing his physical and mental limits. He learned to meditate under the moonlit sky, attuning himself to the natural energies flowing through Xinxia. He practiced martial arts, honing his body into a vessel capable of channeling his cultivated energy.

As Wu Kang's mastery grew, he began to experience profound transformations. He developed an acute sensitivity to the energy currents around him, enabling him to manipulate the elements at will. With a flick of his hand, he could summon gusts of wind or command the earth to shake beneath his feet.

But cultivation was not merely about acquiring power; it was also a journey of self-discovery and enlightenment. Wu Kang delved into the depths of his soul, confronting his fears, doubts, and weaknesses. He learned the importance of humility, compassion, and balance in his pursuit of cultivation.

With each passing day, Wu Kang's reputation as a skilled cultivator spread throughout Xinxia. People sought his guidance, hoping to learn from his experiences and witness his extraordinary abilities. Wu Kang humbly shared his knowledge, emphasizing that cultivation was not a destination but a lifelong journey of growth and self-improvement.

In time, Wu Kang became a revered figure in Xinxia, known for his benevolence, wisdom, and remarkable cultivation prowess. He established a school where aspiring cultivators could gather to learn and support one another on their paths.

Generations came and went, but the legacy of Wu Kang and his cultivation teachings endured. The village of Xinxia became a hub of cultivation, attracting seekers from far and wide. Through their collective efforts, Xinxia thrived, its people harnessing the powers of cultivation to protect the land, heal the wounded, and promote harmony among all beings.

And so, the story of Wu Kang and the cultivation arts of Xinxia lived on, an eternal reminder that the true power of cultivation lay not in dominance or conquest, but in the cultivation of one's spirit, the betterment of oneself, and the harmony with the world around."

14bw2e7,1,2023-06-17,Riordan Retrospective: Daughter of The Deep,u/ArthurDrakoni,scifi,https://www.reddit.com/r/scifi/comments/14bw2e7/riordan_retrospective_daughter_of_the_deep/,"Welcome once again to my Riordan Retrospective. For those of you just joining the fun, this is my look back at the works of Rick Riordan. That means Percy Jackson, its sequels, and spin-offs. This is less of a formal review and more of a relaxed look back.    


Last time, we finished our look back at *The Trials of Apollo*with a look back at [*The Tower of Nero*](https://drakoniandgriffalco.blogspot.com/2021/01/riordan-retrospective-tower-of-nero.html). We thought that we’d said goodbye to the worlds of Rick Riordan. Little did we know that a new book was about to surface. As such, we’re taking a look back at [*Daughter of the Deep*](https://www.amazon.com/Daughter-Deep-Rick-Riordan/dp/1368077927).

  
Ana Dakkar is about to finish her freshman year at Harding-Pencroft Academy. It is a five-year academy specializing in marine science. She, and her nineteen classmates, are about to begin their freshmen trials. Harding-Pencroft holds its students very high standards. However, before they can take off, the school is destroyed by a series of sonic torpedoes. The remaining students and professors of Harding-Pencroft regroup aboard their yacht the Varuna. Ana discovers several major revelations. Jules Verne’s novels *20,000 Leagues Under the Sea* and *The Mysterious Island* were based on actual events. Captain Nemo was indeed a real person, and Ana is his direct descendant. In fact, the whole point of Harding-Pencroft Academy is to safeguard Nemo’s legacy and technology. Their next stop is Lincoln Island, the final resting place of Nemo and the *Nautilus*. But danger lurks around every corner as the survivors of Harding-Pencroft are hunted by their old rivals: Land Academy.   


Well, it looks like we’re back sooner than I expected. I thought we’d be back for that Irish Mythology book Rick said he was planning. However, that seems to have been put on the back-burner.  *Daughter of the Deep* apparently has been a long time coming. Way back in 2009, Disney executives asked Rick what Disney property he would want to write a book based on. It could be anything he wanted. He chose *20,000 Leagues Under the Sea*, as the 1954 film adaptation is one of his favorite movies. Technically, Disney only owns the rights to the movie, not the original book. The original Verne novel has long since slipped into the public domain. I’m tempted to think that Rick was, at least somewhat, trolling the executives.    


I actually went back and watched the 1954 movie adaptation of *20,000 Leagues Under the Sea*. I agree with Rick here. The movie is, I must say, a truly underrated gem among live-action Disney films. In fact, I might even give it its own review at some point. Now, the movie does take some liberties with the source material. Though, personally, I’d say that was to its benefit, as it made for a more engaging story that worked better in film. Verne was known for doing a lot of research with his novels, and often devoted entire paragraphs to explaining the science in detail. Unfortunately, this does make for a rather dry reading experience. I’ve heard Verne works better in the original French, but that is a language I do not speak. Amusingly, students at Harding-Pencroft are required to read *20,000 Leagues Under the Sea*and *The Mysterious Island*. Ana found them both to be a bit dry for her taste. I myself enjoyed *The Mysterious Island*slightly more than *20,000 Leagues*, but it still suffered from many of the same issues.    


I’ve heard a few people wonder what it might be like if Rick Riordan were to write a science fiction novel. Well, we now have our answer. We know more about the surface of the Moon than we do our own deep oceans. Twelve people have walked on the surface of the Moon, but only two have ever been to the bottom of the Marianas Trench. Ocean-based science fiction is still comparatively rare compared to space-based or terrestrial-based science fiction. So, I’m glad to see that *Daughter of the Deep* tapped into some of the vast potential of ocean-based science fiction.    


Now, I should probably clarify that *Daughter of the Deep* is set outside of the Riordanverse. Rick has confirmed that it takes place in its own self-contained world. So, don’t expect to see any cameos from Percy, Annabeth, or any other Riordanverse characters. Still, it is similar enough in terms of style to a typical Riordanverse novel, and thus, I’ve chosen to include it as part of the retrospective.   


Speaking of style, let’s begin there. Rick has said he took a film writing course before he wrote *Daughter of the Deep*. That is very apparent in how the prose itself is written. It reads very much like a movie script. The narration is presented in first-person present tense. This helps add to the sense of action and urgency as the plot movies along. The pacing also feels very much like what you might find in a movie. We got a lot of action scenes in quick succession. We get the usual info dumps, but we don’t really take as much time for introspection. As we’ll discuss a bit later, this lack of introspection was very much to the book’s detriment. I’m willing to bet that all this is very much by design. Daughter of the Deep is being adapted into a movie on Disney+. In fact, the movie was announced even before the book came out. So, it certainly feels like Rick wrote *Daughter of the Deep* with an eye towards the movie adaption.   


I would have liked if we had gotten to explore Harding-Pencroft Academy a bit more before it got destroyed. What brief glimpses we do see are utterly fascinating. The students are all decided into four different houses based on their area of study. Yeah, they’ve heard all the *Harry Potter* jokes plenty of times. Though, personally, when I saw the initials HP in an ocean-themed book, I briefly wondered if Rick Riordan was going to tackle the Lovecraft Mythos. Back on topic, the houses are Dolphin, Shark, Cephalopod, and Orca. Dolphin focuses on communications, exploration, cryptography, and counterintelligence. Shark handles command, combat, weapons systems, logistics. Cephalopod deals with engineering, applied mechanics, innovation, and defensive systems. Orca is all about medicine, psychology, education, marine biology, and communal memory. If you’re wondering about that last one, it basically means the history of Harding-Pencroft and Captain Nemo.    


One of the things I appreciated was that each of the four main characters is from a different house. One of my gripes about *Harry Potter* is that pretty much all the important characters come from Gryffindor. Well, unless they’re a villain, and come from Slytherin. Ravenclaw had Luna and Cho, I guess, but Hufflepuff got the short end of the stick for sure. Getting back on track, having the four main protagonists of *Daughter of the Deep* be from different houses provided a theme that everyone has something unique to bring to the table. You can also see it as advocating for multiculturalism, but without being preachy about it.   
 However, I do have on criticism. House Orca needed a better name. Orcas are a type of dolphin, the largest, in fact. We’ve got representatives for mammals, fish, and mollusks. How’s about giving some love to the reptiles? Personally, I would have named them House Sea Turtle instead. Or failing that, show some love to the echinoderms, and name them House Seastar. House Sea Cucumber would also work. Don’t give me that look! Sea cucumbers are noble animals and wonders of nature.    


I do wish that we’d gotten to see more of Harding-Pencroft before it was destroyed. What brief glimpses we do get are utterly fascinating. As you might expect, they have quite an expansive aquarium full marine creatures. Upperclassmen train in submarine simulations using full-size mock-up submarines submerged in deep pools. However, the most fascinating class is one where students get to consider, and theorize, about the ways technology and science might have developed had history gone differently. As a major fan of alternate history I have but one thing to say: sign me up now! Well, its actually there as a way to slowly ease the students into learning the truth about Captain Nemo and his inventions. Still, sounds like a very fun class to take. I also liked how the various sections of the school are named after famous ocean explorers. There’s one part named after the Chinese navigator Zheng He, and one named after the polar explorer Ernest Shackleton.  


I thought all of the diving scenes were particularly well-written. Rick Riordan has a true passion for scuba diving. This really shines through during the diving scenes. I also really like how the diving suits all use jet-propulsion that mimics the siphons of cephalopods. That was a really creative touch.   
Also, for those wondering, Land Academy was named after Ned Land. He founded it, along with Professor Aronnax, in hopes to keeping the world safe from Nemo. Aronnax and Land viewed Nemo as a madman. I assume Aronnax was the brains behind that one. Ned Land was good natured, but not terribly bright.   


Okay, let’s talk about the characters. Ana is the protagonist, but I want to save her for last. We’ll start with her roommates, and best friends, Nelinha and Ester. Nelinha da Silva grew up in an orphanage in Rio de Janeiro, but got to attend Harding-Pencroft on a scholarship. She’s also the closest the series gets to referencing *Percy Jackson and the Olympians*. I can best describe Nelinha as what would happen if Charles Beckendorf and Silena Beauregard were to have a kid. And, you know, if they were still alive. She’s a complete mechanical genius, and geeks out over machines and engine parts. She’s a member of House Cephalopod, naturally. However, she is also obsessed with fashion, and always makes sure to look her best at all times. Nelinha doesn’t just pack outfits, she packs entire wardrobes.    


One of my prior complaints about Rick Riordan is that he only seems to know how to write one type of female character. Namely, he seems to believe that being a strong female character means being a tomboy who hates all things girly. So, it was nice to see Nelinha as a course correction on that front. Nelinha being from Brazil is likely a nod to how popular Rick Riordan’s books are in Brazil. So, I’m sure Brazilian fans were excited to finally get a Brazilian main character.    


On the flipside, we also get Ester Harding. She’s a member of House Orca. She is a blood relative of one of the founders of Harding-Pencroft. She is also the first autistic character in a Rick Riordan book. I’m still bitter about how he wrote a Muslims character before he wrote an autistic character. In the Riordanverse, anyone can be a demigod, unless you’re autistic, it would seem. I had high hopes for Ester. You don’t see autistic girls too often in the media. Riordan has said that he got sensitivity readers to help him with writing characters from different cultural backgrounds. However, it would seem none of them offered insight into autistic people. It almost feels like Riordan watched a couple episodes of *The Good Doctor* and was like “I got this!” You know those TikTok clips of that guy having a temper tantrum while shouting “I am a surgeon!” Yeah, that’s *The Good Doctor*. It was another show I had high hopes for, but fell back on stereotyping autistic people. Don’t get me started on my problems with *The Good Doctor*, we’ll be here all day.   


Anyway, Ester displays a number of stereotypical traits. She yo-yos between being basically non-verbal, and shouting at the top of her lungs. She does this all in a robotic monotone voice. In contrast to Nelinha, Ester has basically no fashion sense, and seems to be going for the long-lost daughter of Albert Einstein look. Ester also doesn’t have much in the way of common sense, and though it never comes up, she’s probably Jewish. Not too many gentiles name Ester. She’s got an excellent memory, to the point of being almost eidetic, but that’s somewhat accurate. Well, maybe not eidetic, but most autistic people do often have amazing memories. How do you think I’m about to write these retrospectives?    


Ana briefly remarks about how some people claim that autistic people can’t feel love or other emotions, and that Ester proves this isn’t true, due to how empathetic she is. Again, this is true, as autistic people can be quite empathetic. Though, I can’t help but wonder if Disney specially made Rick insert that line to cover their asses. See, this isn’t the first time Disney has tackled autism. There was an episode of *Girl Meets World* about how we should all be nice to autistic people. All well and good, but they also claim that autistic people are incapable of experiencing emotions, including love.    


Gemini Twain has been assigned as Ana’s bodyguard. He’s a no-nonsense member of House Shark. He’s also a member of the Church of Jesus Christ and Latter Day Saints. This is certainly an interesting choice, as Gemini is also Black. Historically, Mormons haven’t exactly gotten along well with Black people. Or Native Americans, or Polynesians, or…well, pretty much anybody who isn’t White. The most infamous instance was when Mormon schools refused to desegregate. The American government threatened to revoke their tax exemption status, but wouldn’t you know it, Mormon God rather conveniently changed his mind about Black people. Though, Gemini’s faith doesn’t really come up that much. He doesn’t like swearing or taking the lord’s name in vein, and he mentions his grandma raised him and his brother in the LDS church, but that’s about it. Well, he did get into a minor scuffle with Nelinha. Gemini’s brother went on his mission trip to Brazil, and Gemini assumed Nelinha would know his brother, because she’s from Brazil.    


Well, nice touch having one of the non-White characters be flawed enough to be accidentally racist. I remember back in *The Hammer of Thor* retrospective when I said, paraphrased, “A Muslim demigod? What’s next, a Mormon demigod?” I have on occasion wondered if Rick Riordan reads these retrospectives. Probably a long shot, but you never know.    


Technically, there is a fifth main character: the *Nautilus*itself. It took until about halfway through the book before the *Nautilus* showed up. Yeah, this book has some pacing issues. The Nautilus has what can best be described as an artificial intelligence system. Also, apparently it also includes some organic components. As you might imagine, it is extremely untrustworthy of anyone who isn’t a blood relative of Prince Dakkar, aka Captain Nemo. So, Ana’s biometrics are key to unlocking the Nautilus.    


Unfortunately, the *Nautilus* also highlights one of the issues I had with the book. Apparently, every major invention of the 20th Century was a result of Harding-Pencroft discreetly releasing them to the public. That, or Land Institute stealing them. This caused *Daughter of the Deep* to evoke the Great Man Theory of History. The theory goes that society gets stuck in ruts until a great man, and it’s always a man, shakes up the status quo and moves the world forward. This view has largely fallen out of favor with mainstream historians. Most historians emphasis how the changes were put into motion, often by complex chains of influences, long before the supposedly great men came about.   
You do kind of get this with the main Riordanverse, where pretty much anyone who did anything was either a demigod or a magician. However, that was softened by just how many demigods and magicians there were throughout history. So, it felt more like a team-effort. By contrast, Daughter of the Deep gave us a single scientific übermensch who, apparently, leapfrogged from steam-power to cold fusion reactors. Now, granted, this is also true of Nemo in *20,000 Leagues Under the Sea*. Still, maybe Rick shouldn’t have depicted Nemo in such a lock, stock, and barrel sort of way.  


And that segues into my next point. Harding-Pencroft is deathly afraid of letting the general public get access to Nemo’s technology. They only release technology sparingly, and only when they feel humanity has earned it. Uh, and what metric do they use to determine how worthy humanity is? Beats me, the book offers no details. The adults all make a big deal about how corporations would try to monopolize Nemo’s technology, but nobody ever suggests releasing it as open-source tech. Well, I know the real reason for that. There’s no way that Disney, the poster boy for copyright abuse, is going to be advocating for open-source. A particularly facepalm worthy moment is that fact that Harding-Pencroft refuses to release cold fusion technology…despite climate change being a serious issue! The book would have you believe Harding-Pencroft are the good guys. However, I’m tempted to think Land Institute had a point about Harding-Pencroft being corrupt and selfish.   


Hey, wait a minute. Harding-Pencroft is a secretive organization that is very selective of its membership. It trains its students so that, effectively, they’re cut-off from the outside world. They indoctrinate their students from a young age into their views. They have charismatic leaders and founders. Yikes, I hope the cafeteria never served Kool-Aid! Harding-Pencroft is a cult!    


It would seem that Harding-Pencroft has something akin to the Prime Detective from *Star Trek*. There has been a lot of debate about the morality of the Prime Detective. The main thinking seems to be don’t give advanced weaponry to civilizations that aren’t morally mature.  *The Original Series*also says that it is okay to break the Prime Directive if a planet is in imminent danger. Contrast this with *Next Generation*, where one episode has Captain Picard dithering about if he should save a planet, even if it break the Prime Directive. Of course, the worst offender was *Voyager*. It had an episode where the moral was, basically, don’t save a baby trapped in a burning car, or else the baby will grow-up to be Hitler. Yeah, the Prime Directive kind of devolved into an immoral religious dogma as *Star Trek* went on.    


Point is, Harding-Pencroft’s Prime Directive seems to lean towards that of the later Star Trek entries. Apparently, screw the planet, we need to keep the tech away from corporations! The irony of Disney railing against corporations is so thick you can practically cut it with a machete. Also, if the concern is that the corporations would hoard stuff like the cure for cancer, well, how’s that any different than what Harding-Pencroft is doing?    


Much is made about how Ana must choose to reconcile both the good and the bad of Nemo’s legacy. However, nothing really comes of this. We don’t see her seriously debate or challenge Harding-Pencroft and Land Institute’s views of Nemo. In fact, she gets indoctrinated into Harding-Pencroft’s views pretty quickly. It would have been a great opportunity to show Nemo’s complexity, not just tell us about it. How many innocent lives did he take in his quest for vengeance? Should he have shared his technology with the oppressed peoples chafing under the yoke of colonialism? Is it possible that Land Institute has some valid points, and that Harding-Pencroft has lost its way? All excellent questions that sadly go unanswered.   


As for why that is, it ties into the biggest problem I have with *Daughter of the Deep*. Overall, it feels like merely the novelization of the yet to be produced movie. I was hoping that the novel would be able to stand on its own merits. However, Riordan clearly wrote it so that the adoption process would be streamlined. Debating ethics might not translate to film. Though, it could work in the hands of a competent scriptwriter.    


I feel this streamlining was ultimately to the novel’s determent. I certainly didn’t hate *Daughter of the Deep*. It had plenty of the action and adventure you’d expect from a Rick Riordan novel. However, for every thing I liked, there was almost always something else I didn’t like. It is ironic that Rick claims he spent years working on *Daughter of the Deep*. It overall feels like it was yanked out of the oven before it had a chance to bake properly. Then again, he also claims to have gotten the idea for *Magnus Chase* before he wrote *Percy Jackson*, and look how that turned out.   


[The audiobook](https://www.audible.com/pd/Daughter-of-the-Deep-Audiobook/B09HJ9B8PQ?eac_link=xpKKElbu2ILP&ref=web_search_eac_asin_2&eac_selected_type=asin&eac_selected=B09HJ9B8PQ&qid=UApLGFjh5Z&eac_id=144-0690597-4752814_UApLGFjh5Z&sr=1-2) is narrated by Soneela Nankani. She’s the narrator for the *Aru Shah* audiobooks. Personally, I wasn’t too thrilled when I saw that Soneela would be narrating. However, she gave a fairly decent performance. She voiced Ester in a rather stereotypical way, like she was imitating Sean from *The Good Doctor*, but that was the only true sour note. Speaking of music, the audiobook is filled with music. There’s lots of musical cues throughout the audiobook. Scenes of wonder and whimsy have inspirational music, action scenes have exciting music. There’s a scene where Ana plays a pipe organ aboard the *Nautilus*, and we actually get to hear it. I thought that was a really nice touch.    


Now, let’s analyze the cover. This is a nice looking cover. The undersea landscape is bright and vibrant. We see Ana and Gemini in their divining suits. Their faces are clear and unobscured. The Rick Riordan Presents books goes with this approach as well. Something about it being important for minority kids to see themselves clearly represented on book covers. We also see the Nautilus in the background, along with a giant octopus.    


So, *Daughter of the Deep* has a lot of potential, and I certainly wouldn’t mind a sequel. However, there’s a lot of room for improvement. It needed to stand on its own merits, not just be the dry run for the movie script. Still, it's lightyears better than our next port of call. Next time, we’re tackling *The Sun and The Star*. The claws are coming out, and I’m prepared to fully eviscerate Mark Oshiro’s glorified self-insert fanfic.

14c31sw,1,2023-06-17,Bias against ChatGPT in Academia/Research,u/w1ngslikeeagles,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/14c31sw/bias_against_chatgpt_in_academiaresearch/,"I work with basic science and clinical research groups and have noticed a lot of misconceptions and fears about ChatGPT, preventing us from fully embracing its potential to fuel advancements in science.

Recently I used ChatGPT to draft around 90% of the introduction for a publication. My colleagues praised it as one of the best intros they had seen, but as soon as I mentioned the extensive use of ChatGPT, suddenly the work was invalidated. I was forced to rewrite the entire section without ChatGPT, even though the initial version was exceptional.

Another time we discovered a new phenomenon which required us to coin a term to accurately describe it. ChatGPT came up with a succinct and brilliant term that resonated with everyone in the lab. Our principle investigator had initially praised the term, but he must have talked to his colleagues about how students were using ChatGPT to ""take shortcuts"" or ""cheat"" because he decided to discard the term solely because it was coined by ChatGPT. We had to come up with an inferior replacement term that didn't do the phenomenon justice.

Finally there was a project that required extensive programming to develop a machine learning analytical approach, and we didn't have access to a developer. I spent the past 8 months developing thousands of lines of code with ChatGPT. The code worked great, and some student programmers reviewed it and were super impressed. While the PhDs in my lab were impressed with the results, they were critical since the scripts were not written by professionals and were hesitant to incorporate the code into the project. (They eventually came around.)

This bias against ChatGPT reminds me of the struggles faced by historically marginalized groups in science. Just like a century ago when ideas from women or people of color were discounted due to racial or sexist biases, today, we witness a similar distrust towards AI-generated ideas. We need to use AI to accelerate research, enhance creativity, and develop groundbreaking ideas that were previously beyond our reach. It's time to break free from the constraints of bias. Future generations will look back and judge us harshly for our biases which slowed scientific advancement."
14c96ql,1,2023-06-17,I asked ChatGPT about the plot of a My Little Pony: Equestria Girls and Monster High crossover movie..... (Long Post),u/SuriPolomareFan2003,MonsterHigh,https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHigh/comments/14c96ql/i_asked_chatgpt_about_the_plot_of_a_my_little/,"I asked ChatGPT this question:   


""Hello, Can you make a script of what a Equestria Girls and Monster High crossover movie would've looked like?  
 Characters:  
 All Canterlot High, Crystal Prep Academy, and Monster High students   


Make the film shows where It begins with Celestia in the gymnasium announcing a new group of Crystal Prep students alongside old ones visiting Canterlot High for a special visit with Principal Cadance and CHS students discussing about it and on the forest of Canterlot City, and the next week the Monster High characters sneak into Canterlot City (the Equestria Girls universe) with a human disguise and went to Canterlot High and Draculaura is called the ""pink she-devil"" by some Crystal Prep and Canterlot High students like Suri Polomare and Upper Crust expect one CPA student says it's not a ""pink she-devil"" it's a vampire and CPA student Fleur-de-lis taking low quality pictures of the Monster High characters from a long distance and reporting it to the TV news via text message and Monsters are discovered in Canterlot City in the TV news and make the TV news scene when the news anchor says that it's discovered in Canterlot City that the ""pink she-devil"" and other suspicious creatures are actually a vampire and also a werewolf, mummy, sea monster, zombie and Frankenstein and CHS and CPS students watch the news on their phones in the hallway and make the Mane 7 not knowing about the Monster High characters until they found their hiding place and the Monster High characters introduce themselves to the Mane 7 with a flashback scene that shows how they get to Canterlot City and Sunset Shimmer need help from Princess Twilight Sparkle from Equestria before it's too late and the Monster High characters proved their innocence and Canterlot High and Crystal Prep students apologizing them for beliving that they are dangerous.""   


And this is what they replied to me:   


Title: ""Equestria Girls and Monster High: Friendship Beyond Borders""

 Look, it's the pink she-devil! Watch out for her fangs!   


UPPER CRUST  
 (laughs)  
 She's not just a she-devil, she's a vampire!   


One Crystal Prep Academy student, Fleur-de-lis, steps forward and corrects them.   


FLEUR-DE-LIS  
 (disapprovingly)  
 Actually, she's not a ""pink she-devil."" She's a vampire, and the others with her are unique creatures as well.   


INT. CANTERLOT CITY - TV NEWSROOM - DAY   


Fleur-de-lis discreetly captures low-quality pictures of the Monster High characters from a distance. She sends them as a text message to a TV news station, anonymously reporting their presence.   


INT. CANTERLOT CITY - TV NEWSROOM - DAY   


A news anchor sits at the news desk, preparing for a segment.

INT. CANTERLOT HIGH HALLWAY - DAY   


Canterlot High and Crystal Prep students watch the news on their phones, gathering in the hallway.   


CRYSTAL PREP STUDENT

 (nods)  
 I'll contact her right away. We can't waste any time.   


INT. CANTERLOT HIGH ROOFTOP - DAY   


Princess Twilight Sparkle appears through a magical portal, joining the group. She listens to their story and formulates a plan.

But because Shez is bad with names, everyone thinks theclub is a Byleth Fanclub.",u/Hello_There4206969,FireEmblemThreeHouses,https://www.reddit.com/r/FireEmblemThreeHouses/comments/14cc0b2/imagine_a_timeline_for_three_houseshopes_where/,"Some facts about the Fuck Byleth Club...

Hubert, Jeritza, Felix, and Monica>!(?) !<are founding members of the club alongside Shez and are it's advisors.

Arval's a member of the club who everyone assumes is the Club President's imaginary friend.

Shez went to Rhea to have their club made official since Seteth would likely shoot them down. Shez didn't tell the other Club Founders what name he had settled on for the club.

Rhea okayed the club aware of the problem it would suffer due to it's name and can't wait for Seteth to find out about the club. 

She made herself the club's advisor so she can get a front row to the chaos that'll be happening when Dorothea, Sylvain, and Edelgard join the Fuck Byleth Club misinterpreting what it's about.

The club meets up weekly in Abyss at the Ashen Wolves classroom. Whom aren't a fan of getting kicked out of their classroom.

The Ashen Wolves eventually will start a Fuck Fuck Byleth Club that they get Aelfric to approve behind Seteth's back before Aelfric get's chased out of the monastery.

Byleth is going to be very weirded there's an official fanclub dedicated to people finding them hot and figure Shez must have a sizable crush on them.

Which Shez will be mortified once they find out and are rejected by Byleth who doesn't want a relationship with one of her students. (Presently.)

Byleth will figure the Fuck Fuck Byleth Club is about students who hate them and be saddened learning this before becoming the club's advisor to find out why it's members dislike them. (This'll result in the Wolves and Leonie actually growing very attached to Byleth. So, kind of wholesome.)

Jeralt's going to need a drink after he learns what sort of nonsense Rhea's caused.

Flayn's going to join the former club to annoy Seteth for being a bothersome meddler.

Rhea wrote all the rules for the club on a piece of paper in Almyran so she can run the Fuck Byleth Club like a dictatorship to annoy all of its founders except Shez who would have been expelled from the club if it weren't for Rhea. Any attempts to leave the club or strip Rhea of her power over it will result in a lecture from Seteth whilst cleaning the cathedral with their toothbrush. (You're not allowed to replace the toothbrush afterwards.)

Rhea >!and Claude!< are the only people in the monastery who can read Almyran. Almyran's aren't known for their written language being easily parsed by non-Almyrans.

Catherine is going to try and get the Rhea Fanclub she established during her academy days restarted.  Seteth, feeling vindictive towards Rhea, will help and see it's named the Fuck Rhea Club.

Edelgard will join the Fuck Rhea Club thinking it's what the Fuck Byleth Club was actually about except with Rhea instead.

The Fuck Byleth Club's logo is of a heart with Byleth's face on it.

The Fuck Fuck Byleth Club's logo is the above logo with an X over Byleth's face.

The Fuck Rhea Club's logo is Rhea's face with an X over it.

Offer suggestions of potential members amongst the Three Houses/Hopes cast for the 3 above clubs and a brief explanation for why they'd join the club they joined.

Were this all a fanfic, I'd probably title it: ""Fire Emblem: Three Clubs"""

**🧠 Deep Learning’s Diminishing Returns – Cost of Improvement Becoming Unsustainable** [**(link)**](https://spectrum.ieee.org/deep-learning-computational-cost)  
Deep learning is a modern trend  in AI that has been moving from streamlined systems based on expert  knowledge toward flexible statistical models. The success of flexible  deep-learning models can be seen in machine translation, where deep  learning has proven itself superior almost everywhere it's applied. The  bad news is that this flexibility comes at an enormous computational  cost, which is becoming unsustainable as researchers are nearing the  frontier of what their tools can achieve.

**Using Generative AI for Workflow Automation and Customized Emails** [**(link)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcAgsSKCm1o)  
Badine AI is a workflow automation  tool that uses generative AI to automate mundane tasks such as  copy-pasting and outreach emails. The podcast discusses the use of  generative AI in automation and how it can be used to customize emails  based on LinkedIn profiles. The speaker explains that their company,  Genotaur, focuses on building automation for end-users and offers a  choice of models to use, such as GPT 3.5 or GPT 4. They also emphasize  the importance of building abstraction layers and training tools that  are independent of specific models, as the technology will commoditize  over time. The podcast also discusses the benefits of deterministic  execution in automation scripts, which are like normal programs that  always do the same thing every time. The podcast concludes by  highlighting the positive impact of AI technology in various fields,  including healthcare, education, and productivity.

14ck3tm,61,2023-06-18,AI Report 2023.06.18 - One of the craziest days in AI news I’ve ever seen,u/fatshogun,ArtificialInteligence,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/14ck3tm/ai_report_20230618_one_of_the_craziest_days_in_ai/,"* **AI can make it easier for anyone to create custom-tailored viruses and pathogens**: MIT researchers asked undergraduate students to test whether chatbots ""could be prompted to assist non-experts in causing a pandemic,"" and found that within one hour the chatbots suggested four potential pandemic pathogens. The chatbots helped the students identify which pathogens could inflict the most damage, and even provided information not commonly known among experts. The students were offered lists of companies who might assist with DNA synthesis, and suggestions on how to trick them into providing services. This is arguably the strongest case against open-sourcing AI \[source: [https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/new-ai-fear-making-it-easy-for-anyone-to-mint-dangerous-new-viruses/ar-AA1cCVq6](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/new-ai-fear-making-it-easy-for-anyone-to-mint-dangerous-new-viruses/ar-AA1cCVq6)\]
* **Intel will start shipping 12-qubit quantum processors to a few universities and academic research labs:** 12 qubits is still not a big deal, it’s not a lot of computing power. However, as we all know, technology, and very specifically processing power, is subject to Moore’s Law, which for those of you who actually had a social life in high school and now you don’t know what Moore’s Law is, simply means that technology gets better, faster, stronger, and cheaper as time goes by. And, compared to regular processors, quantum processors are orders of magnitude faster. Ok, how is this related to AI? I’m glad you asked. Advancements in AI pretty much come down to two things – data and computing power. We already have entire oceans of data, or, rather, Google and Facebook do, and the biggest challenge to making God-like AI is the laggings in processing power. And when that stops being a problem because of quantum computers, when we plug AI into quantum computers… I guess we’ll finally see if we get to live in a Kumbaya Utopia where we all love each other and don’t have to work unless we feel like it, or, you know, Skynet meets the Matrix type of thing. \[source: [https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/06/intel-to-start-shipping-a-quantum-processor/](https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/06/intel-to-start-shipping-a-quantum-processor/) \]
* **People are using AI to automate responses to sites that pay them to train AI**: So, for those of you who’ve never watched one of those “how to make $5000 a month on the Internet” videos, Amazon's Mechanical Turk is a platform where people can complete small tasks like data validation or transcriptions or surveys to earn a bit of money. Well, researchers at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne in Switzerland have found that a significant number of Mechanical Turk workers are already using large language models (LLMs) to automate their labor. \[source: - [https://futurism.com/the-byte/people-automating-responses-train-ai](https://futurism.com/the-byte/people-automating-responses-train-ai) \]
* **A Chick-fil-A in Alpharetta, Atlanta, is testing AI-powered delivery robots**: This sounds like bad news for delivery people. However, I think we’ve kinda seen this story play out before, since Amazon tried to automate delivery with drones a few years ago, and regulatory setbacks prevented their efforts. I’m not sure how this particular Chick-fil-A restaurant has pulled this off, it may not be entirely legal, but let’s see how this develops. \[source: [https://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/north-fulton-county/metro-atlanta-chick-fil-a-tests-delivery-robots-equipped-with-artificial-intelligence/GSLBEX2NFJAQFGE3H7KW3YFOCU/](https://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/north-fulton-county/metro-atlanta-chick-fil-a-tests-delivery-robots-equipped-with-artificial-intelligence/GSLBEX2NFJAQFGE3H7KW3YFOCU/) \]
* **Researchers from Microsoft and UC Santa Barbara Propose LONGMEM: An AI Framework that Enables LLMs to Memorize Long History:** As you may know, even the most advanced AI bots like ChatGPT can only take input of up to a certain length, and you can still use several prompts to add more input, but this way of functioning is still limited, as the chatbot doesn’t really have long-term memory, doesn’t really learn from your own specific actions and adjust itself based on your input. If that were possible, a whole other world of features and possibilities would open up for AI. Well, the proposed LONGMEM framework should enable language models to cache, to keep in memory long-form prior context or knowledge, which will kinda give LLMs superpowers and we will likely start seeing a lot more new applications. Exciting stuff. \[source: [https://www.marktechpost.com/2023/06/16/researchers-from-microsoft-and-uc-santa-barbara-propose-longmem-an-ai-framework-that-enables-llms-to-memorize-long-history/](https://www.marktechpost.com/2023/06/16/researchers-from-microsoft-and-uc-santa-barbara-propose-longmem-an-ai-framework-that-enables-llms-to-memorize-long-history/) \]
* **AI used to catch a thief**: A video on Facebook is going viral, a person was caught on a security camera stealing stuff from some street artist kids in the Philippines, and the Internet rose to the occasion – social media users used AI to sharpen and enhance the image of the thief, sent the pic to the kids, and they gave it to the police. The authorities were able to recover the bag, but one cellphone was missing. The suspect is identified but still at large. The implications of this are not certain. This is still an AI-generated image, it can very easily be inaccurate, and the wrong person might easily get punished even when innocent. \[source: [https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1307441943456719](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1307441943456719]) \]

14crye6,52,2023-06-18,Graduate South African Software Engineer Job Search Recap,u/Aquaman911,capetown,https://www.reddit.com/r/capetown/comments/14crye6/graduate_south_african_software_engineer_job/," 

https://preview.redd.it/8k59e0vlmt6b1.png?width=3000&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9d211547a4482d56d8571ac72995f75ef53b3cc1

I thought that doing a recap of my recent job search as a graduate would help to provide some interesting insights for current students, grads, or anyone looking to get into the software field. I find that there is a lack of in depth content from a South African perspective.

**Degree:** Electrical & Computer Engineering (UCT)

**Length of Search:** 6 weeks (Feb 2023 - March 2023)

**Previous experience:** 3 month software internship

# Background

I decided to jump into the job market instead of pursuing further education, as I was interested in the field of Software Engineering and I felt that I would be able to get the best experience hands-on in a professional environment. For clarification, my job search started after most companies with large graduate programs (i.e. Entelect), had already signed their graduate pool and started their training.

# Preparation

Obviously my 4 year degree was a big part of my long term preparation, but it was not focused enough to help me land a software job besides giving me a foundation (admittedly a strong one), to work off of. At the time, I had no idea what to expect in terms of the interview process, so I leaned on [r/southafrica](https://www.reddit.com/r/southafrica/) and [r/capetown](https://www.reddit.com/r/capetown/) posts as well as [r/cscareerquestions](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/). In retrospect, [r/cscareerquestions](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/) was not a very helpful resource as the US interview process seems to operate differently to ours. I practiced some basic Data Structures and Algorithms on Leetcode, I made sure that I knew my CV and the projects on there inside and out, and I read up on common technical questions regarding different frameworks and languages. I do have a personal GitHub page but there is nothing noteworthy that an interviewer could have looked at.

# The Search

I started off my search on LinkedIn, where I had a fleshed out profile. I filtered jobs for Cape Town, Entry Level, and the stack that I was interested in (Java/Python backend roles). There were a fair amount of jobs incorrectly labeled or those which didn't interest me and so applying on LinkedIn often felt like sifting through trash to find something worth applying to (which often had 100+ applications in a couple of hours). A couple of recruiters reached out to me on the platform but nothing significant came from the search on LinkedIn. This was the primary platform I used to find jobs for the first 4 weeks of my search, which in retrospect, was a waste of time.

The second platform I tried out was PNet, a name that I was not familiar with at the time. I also applied for a couple of jobs here and there but I was not getting much response. This platform was, however, a gold mine for being contacted by recruiters. In the space of a week I was phoned by 10+ recruiters who all pitched multiple job vacancies that they were trying to fill. These positions seemed to be a bit more refined than those which I found on LinkedIn but by and large they were not exactly what I was interested in (front-end, data engineering, certain languages & frameworks). I decided that a conversation couldn't hurt and so I went to as many first interviews as I could.

I absolutely recommend researching companies which you apply to, including their employee reviews on Glassdoor or Indeed. I considered anything on the internet fair game, which meant that if I could read about the interview processes that other people had, I absolutely did and I prepared around that.  This is also a relatively new advantage that job seekers have in the market but I used ChatGPT extensively to type up my cover letters, to help me prepare for common technical questions and even to help me solve some online test questions. I consider it an accelerant for my ability, similar to being able to search for information on the internet compared to using books in libraries, and if it is expected to be used on the job then you can bet I'm using it in the interview.

# The Interviews

**First round: 10**

The first round interviews were structured in a variety of different ways: online meetings with an HR representative and a Senior Engineer, just an HR representative, a timed test or an asynchronous take home assignment. I preferred the take home assignments because it gave the me freedom to solve a problem using my own creativity without time pressure. The timed tests were often based around finding and fixing bugs, implementing functions or using data structures.

I did not encounter any algorithms and the data structures tended to be more basic ones such as arrays and maps. This is often contrary to the US interviews which are apparently heavily focused on DSA. Disclaimer: I did not interview at large international organizations like Amazon so YMMV. First interviews which were online meetings tended to focus on more generic personality and behavioural questions, verifying background information or questions regarding my CV (when a technical person was present). Work-life balance as well as an interesting product/tech with efficient processes is important to me, so I made sure to find out about the culture of companies and the type of teams that my role would fit into.

**Second round: 7**

The second round interviews were largely online meetings. I had either a test/assignment -> HR interviews, HR interview -> assignment or HR interview -> technical interview. For the second round interviews which were technical, they were centered around my CV (work experience and projects) as well as technical questions about the languages and frameworks which would be used on the job. In my case, I was asked about Java/Python concepts, databases and general logic questions.

**Third round: 2**

For the third round interviews, one was a technical interview with a Senior Engineer and the other a live coding assignment. The live coding assignment was definitely an interesting experience and I managed to be able to deliver working code based on the requirements given to me, which helped me to move onto the final round.

**Fourth round: 1**

The only fourth round interview I had was an in depth technical interview with two Senior Engineers where I also had the opportunity to ask them technical questions about the role. It doesn't seem typical for there to be a fourth round. The most common interview process length was 3 rounds.

# The Offers

Throughout my search I was able to land 5 different offers, although only a couple of them were for the direction I wanted to pursue. Since I had a couple of offers at the same time, I was able to negotiate a relatively good contract. I wouldn't recommend negotiating for an entry level position if you don't have some sort of leverage or if you desperately need a job. From my experience and contact with recruiters, if you have a Computer Science adjacent degree and you're being offered less than 25k/month, you're being low-balled. My advice would be to aim for the R30k-R35k range and accept in the R25k-R30k range if you feel that other contract specifics are worthwhile. Don't be afraid to ask about the salary: when I was in contact with recruiters, I was not willing to go to interviews where the salary was not discussed or where a range less than R25k was being offered.

It seemed to be the norm for companies to offer benefits such as contributions to a retirement annuity or medical aid. Working hours of 40-45 on paper with core hours of 9-4 also seemed to be the norm. I was adamant about working either remotely or hybrid (I refused all 5 days a week on-site work). According to OfferZen's [2023 State of the Software Developer Nation](https://www.offerzen.com/reports/software-developer-south-africa#south_african_tech_trends-2-0), 92.12% of developers work either hybrid or remote so there's plenty of opportunity out there in this field. The contracts seemed to be pretty standard, but scrutinize for any out of the ordinary clauses. Make sure that you know how PAYE and deductions like UIF work to calculate your net salary. Something which you may not know is that if you earn above the earnings threshhold (\~R20k/month), an employer is not obligated to pay for overtime, but it can be negotiated.

# Conclusion

I learnt an immense amount during the job search and it definitely taught me valuable lessons to not be afraid to make demands based on my worth, to turn things down, and to not take rejection personally. Even though the world economy seems to be heading into a recession and South Africa has been having issues growing its economy, the software industry seems to be relatively solid even for juniors and grads. I have a biased perspective considering that I have a degree and that my job search is anecdotal, so take that into account. I do think that there are opportunities out there for those without a degree and I know of several people that came out of boot camps and landed jobs this year. I hope that this dissection of my experience is a valuable data point for the future job search of those in the industry. There may be some things which I have missed and plenty of finer detail which I don't have the space to write on, so feel free to ask any questions which you may have."

**Background**

The USLR has cast away decades of animosity in favour of class solidarity and unity unlike any other seen before. For the union to be successful, the constituent states must be uplifted such that they are at par with the Israeli economy. The West Bank, following almost half a century of occupation has remained underdeveloped and poor. Lebanon has never recovered from its civil war, and Jordan continues to suffer from chronic water scarcity among other challenges preventing its growth. Moreover, the return of the refugees presents an opportunity for a great reinvestment into [abandoned towns and villages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_towns_and_villages_depopulated_during_the_1947%E2%80%931949_Palestine_war) as new developments for returning Palestinians. Coupled with the associated population growth, this would promote great economic growth. Lastly, the USLR politburo believes in the benefits of automation and AI, and will invest greatly to maintain an edge in these fields. As such, the USLR Politburo has approved the following five year plan with over $170B in investments with the objective of:

* Harmonizing and reforming the education system to improve the quality of life for all citizens.

* Investing heavily into healthcare and infrastructure, to ensure that Lebanon and Jordan are not resource sinks and instead contribute to the economic growth of the nation.

* Utilize state resources to develop and maintain a technological edge in tech and computing.

* Develop an autarchy plan for agricultural needs ensuring that no Levantine citizen will go hungry or thirsty.

* Promoting equitable distribution of public lands to refugees who lost said land in 1947 and mediating land rights cases, effectively solving the Palestinian issue.


**Education Reforms ($5 B)**

Among the states in the union, the education system in Israel was the most developed. As such, a similar structure is to be adopted nationwide, with some core changes to help build a new generation. New reforms will ensure that K-12 education is mandatory for every individual below the age of 18, and that GED diplomas are available for those who have not received it.

Revolutionary education will be implanted into the curriculum, teaching the real version of history with an emphasis on colonialism, revolution, and marxist theory. This would help remedy the wrongs of the past and prevent students from one day falling victim to fascism and colonialism. Early education will have a large focus on coexistence, tolerance, and solidarity, casting aside any notions of nationalism and other reactionary ideologies. The education system will also prioritize trilingualism, with english being taught K-12 as an international business language in addition to Arabic and Hebrew. This would create a generation that is able to understand one another and communicate with ease. 

In addition to the reforms that are to be applied across schools in the ULSR, Higher Education will also be overhauled, with large scale investments focusing on emerging global trends like AI, Data Science, and Biomedical Engineering. $1 billion will be allocated to the American University of Beirut (AUB) and Lebanese University for infrastructure upgrades, including modern classrooms, labs, and digital libraries, as well as a lab focusing on large language model and working towards AGI. $1.5 billion will be allocated to upgrade facilities at the University of Jordan in Amman and Jordan University of Science and Technology in Irbid, focusing on the departments of Engineering, Medicine, and ICT. $1 billion will be invested in expanding the Technion and Ben-gurion university, with a special focus on cybersecurity and quantum computing.



**Lebanese Socialist Republic: A Breadbasket ($30B)**

Since the adoption of the unified Levantine currency, the Lebanese economy has largely stabilized. This presents an opportunity to reinvest in the republic and allow it to create wealth and contribute to the ULSR economy. As the region with the most lands condusive to agriculture, substantial amounts of resources are to be invested in expanding agricultural programs to allow for full self sufficiency, allowing Lebanon to become a net exporter after meeting the agricultural needs of the entire ULSR. The current 5 year plan forms part of a greater 10 year plan to invest $30B in Lebanese agriculture to allow it to sustain a population of upwards of 30 million people. While the following programs are also applicable in the Galilee and Irbid region, the bulk of the arable land remains in Lebanon.

Firstly, using advanced AI techniques courtesy of Agritech companies, prime lands for reclamation will be identified and improved using soil improvement techniques such as contour ploughing, terracing, and afforestation. The improved lands, if government owned, will be transformed into cooperatives. Privately owned farmers can opt into a land collectivization system where new farming equipment will be available to them, shared across a larger region. $1B will be allocated for the construction of a series of dams and irrigation systems, particularly in the Bekaa Valley region to help improve irrigation practices.

With assistance from agritech companies across the ULSR, precision farming techniques are to be made available to everyday farmers, allowing the use of GPS, IoT, and Big Data tools to maximize crop yields and optimize water use. This will be controlled by the ministry of agriculture which would  assist the various new cooperatives. $2B will be invested into this initiative. In addition to more efficient planting irrigation, and harvesting practices, improved storage regimes will be put into place, with a $3B investment in road infrastructure, warehouses, logistics, and fully digitized supply chain management across the nation. This would allow for a modernized transportation fleet able to distribute goods and services across the nation.

On the human side, $1.5B will be spent on training farmers in more efficient practices and in creating an agricultural union which seeks to empower farmers, improve practices and business management, as well as provide a digital regional agricultural management platform that would facilitate the trade of agricultural products across the nation, both in terms of machinery and in terms of yield. Additionally, a portion of the earmarked fund will go into equity programs which would promote women and youth in agriculture, providing low-interest loans and improving the participation of women in the workplace. Additional benefits and financial incentives will be in place for farms or collectives employing groups of different sects.

Lastly, the government has announced a $2B investment in a national agritech cooperative known as People's Agricultural Technology Union, or PATU, with a vision of fully automating all farming in the nation, with investments in automation, artificial intelligence, vertical farming, hydroponics, and robotics. An additional $1B was invested in agricultural research facilities and extension services, working with universities across the ULSR, to develop high-yield, drought-resistant crop varieties and sustainable farming methods. 

**Jordanian Socialist Republic: The Regional Energy Beacon ($30B)**

Given the abundant sunshine Jordan receives and its central position, it's strategically located to become a major energy hub in the Levantine region. The grand vision for Jordan in this 5-year plan is to invest $10B in harnessing Jordan's solar power capabilities and become the region's renewable energy powerhouse, fulfilling the energy needs of the ULSR and beyond.

Under the national project, ""Jordan's Solar Power Initiative,"" the government has earmarked $4B for the construction of large-scale solar power plants in Ma'an, Al-Salt, North Irbid, and Aqaba. These power plants will utilize the latest advancements in photovoltaic technology to maximize energy production. Concentrated solar arrays will be used to provide sufficient energy to sustain the entirety of the ULSR if needed, with redundancies being put in place. To complement this, the government will allocate $3B for infrastructure development aimed at optimizing the energy grid and storage facilities. A comprehensive energy storage solution will be deployed to minimize energy waste and ensure consistent energy supply throughout the region.Further, $2B will be allocated to creating decentralized solar power grids in local communities and installing solar panels in government buildings, schools, and hospitals across the country. This effort will be driven by local companies and importing from international partners should it be cheaper.

In addition to the Jordan Solar Power Initiative, a sustainable manufacturer industry will be established in Amman, Zarqa, and Irbid, with new districts being created as SEZs powered by renewable energy. $6B will be spent in an overhaul of these industries with a focus on the pharmaceutical, textile, and automotive industries, capitalizing on the local cost of labour and working to combat unemployment. The new manufacturing industries will partner with tech companies to adopt ""Industry 4.0"", implementing artificial intelligence and robotics in every step of the way to largely improve manufacturing processes and output. The new industries will be controlled by the national government. Among these new state-owned industries, a new national chip-making facility will also be established in Amman, and a green-energy solar panel fabrication plant in Irbid.

While these investments are largely government owned, there will be incentive for smaller private firms to innovate through the Jordan Manufacturing Innovation Fund. This fund will support research and development in manufacturing technologies, fostering a culture of innovation in the industry. It will also facilitate startups aiming to revolutionize manufacturing processes.

**West Bank and Gaza: Industrial Manufacturing ($30B)**

Capitalizing on the strategic location of the West Bank and Gaza, and an expected post-occupation economic boom, a detailed 5-year plan has been drawn up to revitalize the manufacturing sector and position the Palestinian Socialist Region as the epicenter of technological development and advanced manufacturing in the ULSR.

In Nablus, a state-of-the-art vehicle manufacturing facility will be created officially establishing a government owned vehicle manufacturing facility. This initiative, dubbed ""Vehicles for the People"" (not to be confused with Volksvagen), seeks to produce 100,000 vehicles annually by its fifth year of operation. The vehicles will range from sedans to commercial trucks, with an increasing emphasis on electric vehicles (EVs). The facility will be equipped with cutting-edge assembly lines, robotics, and testing facilities. Additionally, a separate facility in Hebron will focus on the production of automotive parts and batteries, particularly for electric vehicles. This facility will cost $2B.

In Jenin and Bethlehem,  the government has proposed the ""Computing for All"" initiative. The focus will be on creating affordable, high-quality computing devices, including laptops, desktops, and tablets, to ensure access for all ULSR citizens to computer systems. State-of-the-art assembly lines and quality control mechanisms will be implemented to ensure the high quality of the products which would only improve over time. The initiative is expected to cost $3B.

To boost the thriving tech ecosystem in the West Bank, a new tech park will be constructed in Ramallah. ""The Ramallah Innovation Hub"" will feature research facilities, start-up incubators, and office spaces for tech giants. The park will focus on fostering start-ups in emerging tech sectors like cybersecurity, quantum computing, AI, and blockchain. It will serve as the local centre for tech research and development, with strong links to universities and research centers across the ULSR.

In a departure from more sophisticated manufacturing, Gaza will return to its traditional roots as a centre for embroidery and textiles. The ""Gaza Textile Revival Initiatives"" will focus on the production of high-quality garments and home textiles, using advanced machinery and sustainable materials. Special economic zones will be created for these factories, providing tax benefits and simplified regulations. A series of factories will be created in the territory providing people with much needed employment.

In addition to the physical industry, training programs will commence across the region allowing people to gain the skills necessary to excel in these new facilities.

**Israel Proper: A Tech-Driven Sustainable Oasis ($50B)**

Being the most developed region in the ULSR, and forming part of the Isratine Socialist Republic, the existing tech ecosystem and infrastructure is to be nurtured and improved, allowing for continued growth and economic integration across the union. As such, the politburo has announced the creation of several initiatives.

Firstly, the ""Silicon Oasis Initative"" will help further improve the ULSR's ability to compete in an international market and maintain its edge.  $5B is to be invested into AI, cybersecurity, blockchain, and quantum computing research. In collaboration with universities and tech companies across the ULSR, this initiative aims to push the technological frontier and create a wellspring of high-value jobs for the entire region. Funds shall also be invested into digitizing government services, implementing smart city solutions in Jerusalem, Haifa, and Tel Aviv, which would be rolled out to the greater ULSR shortly thereafter. In this digital age, this initiative ensures that all citizens of Israel Proper are equipped to participate in, and benefit from, the digital economy. In addition to this, the Silicon Oasis Initiative is investing $10B to establish three major transformative capabilities by 2028:

* Domestic capabilities of producing 8,000 qubit quantum computers by 2028.

* Creating a 300 trillion parameter domestic LLM allowing future research into AGI and generative AI solutions.

* Enhancing domestic robotics firms and catching up to existing companies such as Boston Dynamics in automating industrial practices.

The ""Levantine Gateway Initiative ""was also announced by the Politburo, seeking to improve upon the ports in Haifa and Ashdod, implementing sustainable energy and shipping practices as well as expanding capacity. This would be coupled with a high speed rail network that would be built across the region, connecting these cities to all major metropolitan areas across the ULSR, reducing shipping costs. The Levantinge Gateway Initiative is set to cost $10B.

Lastly, the ""Green New Deal"" seeks to implement a comprehensive program to improve the region's carbon footprint, greatly enhancing public transit, construction practices, and manufacturing nationwide. The goal is to achieve carbon neutrality in every major metropolitan area by 2030.

**The Palestinian Return Initiative ($25B)**

The end of the Palestinian Exodus will result in a large movement of people from across the ULSR back to their historic homelands. This program will aid Palestinians in returning to their ancestral homes, taking into consideration the needs of those currently residing in these areas, and will ensure that reconciliation is made. Some notable challenges to this include legal support, given that the previous Israeli administration since inception was ""legally"" removing people from their rightful homes and replacing them, there would be substantial amounts of legal challenges resulting in the need for compromise and/or compensation. As such the following programs are put into place:

* Land and Property Mediation: Set aside $2 billion to establish a robust mediation and legal support mechanism. This mechanism will help address land disputes and will ensure fair treatment for all parties involved. Cases where property can't be returned due to current occupancy, will be solved through compensation, land exchange, or alternative housing provision.

* Development of New Residential Communities: Invest $8 billion in constructing new, sustainable residential communities across the West Bank and Israel. These communities will be designed to accommodate returning Palestinians and to ease population density in areas of high return. Each community will be equipped with necessary amenities such as schools, health centers, and commercial zones. To speed up the housing construction process, the initiative will employ modern methods of construction such as pre-fabricated modular housing and 3D-printed buildings. Using $2B of the investment, advanced manufacturing plants will be set up in Hebron and Gaza City to produce these pre-fabricated units. These buildings will also be designed with energy-efficiency in mind, with solar panel roofs, efficient insulation, and smart-home technology. All new residential communities are to be walkable with all amenities within a 15 minute walk, and with a mix of commercial space, public facility, and green spaces.

* Reclaim abandoned territories: Following the exodus of 1947, the Israeli Land Authority has held destroyed villages and refused to allow the refugees to return. As such, there is ample amounts of unsettled land that was depopulated that may be rebuilt. These new territories will be home to new developments that would be put under the control of the descendants of those removed from those territories, creating new, complete communities and new monuments to ensure that past mistakes will not be repeated. 

* Renovation and Restoration: Allocate $5 billion towards renovation and restoration of long-unoccupied houses and infrastructures, ensuring they meet modern living standards and comply with safety regulations.

The Palestinian Return Initiativeis aimed at facilitating a smooth, fair, and peaceful integration process for Palestinians returning to their ancestral homes.

14de7lm,14,2023-06-19,AI Report 23.06.19 - Are we in an AI Bubble?,u/fatshogun,ArtificialInteligence,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/14de7lm/ai_report_230619_are_we_in_an_ai_bubble/,"* **The position of Research Scientist, Machine Learning at OpenAI pays up to $370,000 annually.** While everybody is losing their minds about what AI will do to their job, guess what people at the cutting edge are doing? They are leaning into this whole AI thing and looking for AI jobs! And they have 370,000 reasons a year to do so! Not too shabby. Now, granted, OpenAI is like the number one AI company ever created, and there will only be a few positions there reserved for the Einsteins of AI, but still, there are heaps of other AI jobs at other companies that pay around $200 K a year. I say this in pretty much every content piece, and I will keep saying it – learn AI! Don’t fear it – embrace it! \[source: [https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/komando/2023/06/15/ai-jobs-pay-big-money-perks/70308009007/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/komando/2023/06/15/ai-jobs-pay-big-money-perks/70308009007/)\]
* We have the first voice-cloned AI DJ. The DJ AI Ashley will be a part-time host at Oregon’s Live 95.5. Ok, maybe DJs will lose some work because of AI, but come on, who are we kidding, was DJing even a real job, to begin with? I’m kidding, I’m kidding, DJs are fine and they’re gonna continue to be fine and to press buttons and to spin records and to hit on your girlfriend and do all the other DJ things. \[source: [https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-powered-dj-radio-show-host-portland-oregon-station-2023-6](https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-powered-dj-radio-show-host-portland-oregon-station-2023-6)\]
* Let’s move on to more serious topics, and nothing is more serious than talking about China. Yeah, already killed my own buzz just by mentioning it. No, seriously, **Chinese lifelong president Xi Jinping tells Bill Gates he welcomes U.S. AI tech in China**. Well, of course he does, China wants as much Western technology as it can get its hands on. Why? To copy it, duh. This comes after Microsoft pulled back some of its best AI talent from their Chinese offices back to Canada, as they feared their talent would be either poached by Chinese startups, or even approached by the government in some way. I don’t think Microsoft will go back in China after that. \[source: [https://www.reuters.com/technology/chinas-xi-tells-bill-gates-he-welcomes-us-ai-tech-china-2023-06-16/](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chinas-xi-tells-bill-gates-he-welcomes-us-ai-tech-china-2023-06-16/)\]
* **Congress is considering whether AI can hold patents.** Last month, scientists at the MIT used AI to discover the first new antibiotic since the 80s. The new drug was identified from a library of nearly 7,000 drug compounds. They used a machine-learning model that they trained to evaluate whether a chemical compound will inhibit the growth of the bacteria that causes the infections. Back in April, the Supreme Court declined to consider the case of Stephen Thaler, a computer scientist who wanted to patent a beverage holder and an emergency light beacon that were designed entirely by AI, without any human input. Thaler’s application was shot down by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office because only humans can be inventors, and the decision was upheld by lower courts. But! In South Africa, an AI system was listed as the inventor and granted a patent. That’s the situation lawmakers fear, innovation escaping to greener pastures. Tons of experts debate and disagree on this matter. I don’t think granting patents to AI makes sense. Ideally, the patent should be granted to the people that designed that specific AI training algorithm, and the people who provided the data it was trained on, and, of course, the person running the algo, since AI still can’t run itself. It’s a tricky matter anyway, I’m curious to see what happens. \[source: [https://godanriver.com/news/nation-world/government-politics/congress-ponders-whether-artificial-intelligence-should-have-the-power-of-the-patent/article\_c5d31741-1d16-5529-86e4-ea53c89eb95b.html](https://godanriver.com/news/nation-world/government-politics/congress-ponders-whether-artificial-intelligence-should-have-the-power-of-the-patent/article_c5d31741-1d16-5529-86e4-ea53c89eb95b.html)\]
* **Mercedes announced it will add ChatGPT to the infotainment systems in almost one million cars.** People wonder why Mercedes did this, as many don’t really see the need for it. My guess is they’re looking for a way to capitalize on a growing trend, and I’m the last one that could blame them for that. \[source: [https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/15/mercedes-is-adding-chatgpt-to-its-infotainment-system-for-some-reason/](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/15/mercedes-is-adding-chatgpt-to-its-infotainment-system-for-some-reason/)\]
* Yesterday I talked about Voicebox, Meta’s new AI voice tool, and I also proclaimed that I’m excited to try it out. **Well, today we find out that Meta won’t release Voicebox to the public just yet.** Apparently, it is too dangerous for public use. Oooh, spooky… I think they’re trying to build up a bit of hype with claims like this, but on the other hand, I kinda agree that releasing these AI tools for public use as soon as they are made does create a lot of potential for misuse. \[source: [https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/17/23764565/meta-says-its-new-speech-generating-ai-model-is-too-dangerous-for-public-release](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/17/23764565/meta-says-its-new-speech-generating-ai-model-is-too-dangerous-for-public-release)\]
* Speaking of Meta, they have bigger problems than some kids skipping school by using their voice tools to call their teachers pretending they are their parents. **Meta lost a third of their AI talent last year.** Not sure where these people went, looks like some went to OpenAI, and others just burned out. To make things worse, they didn’t even get a shoutout from the White House at the AI leadership summit back in May. And to make things even worse, just 26% of Meta employees believe that Zuck is doing a good job leading the company in these turbulent times. I’m gonna go contrarian here and say that Zuck will rally his troops and that Meta may catch up to its other tech titan siblings. I mean, I don’t believe this wholeheartedly, but I think he has a shot. They do have a ton of data after all, and they can always find other AI nerds to work for them. They will open-source their LLM Llama, they added some AI to Facebook and Instagram, and this Voicebox thing will probably be pretty good. Plus, I think Zuckerberg is one of those wartime CEOs that do better in uncertain times, when the stakes are high, and underperform in boring times when nothing seems to happen, which was the period of several years before ChatGPT. Not betting the house on it, but I think Zuck will pull a rabbit out of the hat and correct Meta’s course in the AI waters. \[source: [https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/meta-lost-third-ai-researchers-152058353.html](https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/meta-lost-third-ai-researchers-152058353.html)\]
* I found this interesting chart on Twitter posted by user AI\_decoded\_ (although I’m not sure it’s theirs because I saw other accounts posting it as well). It shows the increase of assets in certain asset classes, as far as I can tell (the labeling is a bit confusing to me), and we can see that AI has had quite a nice growth since the end of 2022. The implication that the creators of this chart are trying to make is that we may be in an AI bubble, but even if we are, the people that are getting educated on this will benefit one way or the other. I’m not so sure I agree about the bubble part. There is a non-zero chance that the line for AI starts going down today and never goes back up again. That is a real possibility. I don’t think it’s likely, but it’s still a possibility. Personally, I’m going all in on AI myself, with pretty much all of my businesses and entrepreneurial efforts. And I definitely have some skin in the game here, as the Youtube channel really takes a lot of time and resources to produce, even though it probably doesn’t look like that. \[source: [https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd6c748xw2pzm8.cloudfront.net%2Fprod%2F43b55d30-54e7-11eb-9358-dbfa417c7fba-standard.png?dpr=1&fit=scale-down&quality=highest&source=next&width=700](https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd6c748xw2pzm8.cloudfront.net%2Fprod%2F43b55d30-54e7-11eb-9358-dbfa417c7fba-standard.png?dpr=1&fit=scale-down&quality=highest&source=next&width=700)\]
* Since we’re talking about bubbles, **investors might be aware of the potential AI bubble, and they still don’t seem to care**. Extreme valuations of companies that haven’t actually done anything yet are signs of a potential bubble in the start-up space, says Thomas Rice, portfolio manager for Perpetual’s Global Innovation Share Fund. Even Sam Altman says things like “It is definitely like the new bubble – all the people that were working on crypto a few years ago are now working on AI”. Fair enough, that’s definitely true, and as a sidenote, I like Altman’s approach of always quieting down the hype and trying to ground people’s expectations in reality. The good thing about bubbles in general is that some people manage to make money in them. The bad thing about bubbles is that the people who end up making money are usually scumbags. It ends up being just one big game of musical chairs – people invest in companies they don’t know much about, and when most of those companies crash and burn, everyone except the scumbags loses money. But there’s one key detail I don’t see mentioned here – and that’s the very strong possibility this is not a bubble. Look, I love crypto, I’ve been both a student and a creator in that space as well, and I still think it has a lot of potential, but I can tell you this much – the general public never really got on board. Crypto was mostly confined to crypto bros selling each other crypto things. Bitcoin is and always has been a financial revolution, Ethereum will likely become a real and actually used platform at some point, and there are a few other altcoins in the ocean of shitcoins that have real-world use cases. But chances are, if you go to your local store and try to pay with Bitcoin, which is the most popular cryptocurrency by far, you will only get a few strange looks. ChatGPT and AI, on the other hand, are already used by real people, real professionals, every single day, and there’s no going back. That’s the fundamental difference between AI and crypto. Sure, AI may be overhyped a bit right now, but I guarantee you that the promise of generating content for practically no cost and having infinite intelligence at your disposal is too big for all of these governments and companies and entrepreneurs to stop pursuing AI. The genie is out of the bottle, people will only use AI more, and that’s why AI is essentially not a bubble in the long term. \[source: [https://www.afr.com/technology/why-investors-are-knowingly-buying-into-an-ai-bubble-20230618-p5dhht](https://www.afr.com/technology/why-investors-are-knowingly-buying-into-an-ai-bubble-20230618-p5dhht)\]

Since posting the situation has escalated greatly with the department head at my school just handing this off to one of the school administrators, who handed off the to principal, who then handed it off to be dealt with by the superintendent.

Hes going off 1-2 AI detectors he found online. During our meeting he showed me the AI detector flagging 3 sentences out of my 6 page essay as AI generated at 4% human and another student in the class's being 98% human. He thinks if I truly did not use Chatgpt, the number would be a lot higher, but keep in mind its 3 sentences describing a well-known person. I've presented the following information to the superintendent and he still wants more evidence and I don't know what to give him.

1. **Proof of the detectors not working:** I showed him how the constitution and bible get flagged as less than 10% human by these detectors. He says he was surprised and did not understand why the detectors say that, but is still standing by his own judgement. In addition to this, I showed him my teachers own writing from their personal website be flagged as AI (it was from 2010), and he again just repeated he was confused by it, but still upheld my teachers opinion.)
2. **Other detectors not flagging the few sentences as AI-Generated** ***(included OpenAi's own detector)***
3. **Examples of my other writing being very very similar in style:** My school admin said to me ""How do we know you didn't use AI on these assignments as well?""
4. **When he compared my writing to the other students, I told him that everyone has different writing styles**

Based on the meeting I had with him, he's basically only going off the detectors, so could someone here maybe suggest some piece of writing that's not AI-generated, but gets flagged as AI-generated so I can show him.

Im so tired of this whole situation, its been going on now for almost 2 months."

We discussed the issue of ChatGpt and other AI-based tools for writing and how this now makes this assignment pretty much useless. Lots of discussions and suggestions came up on how we could teach the students to use AI, in stead of banning it and the general agreement was that AI-tools are gere to stay and impossible for us as teachers to keep up. 

However, the final solution to the problem: “let’s just add a slide to the introduction telling the students it is not allowed to use AI-based tools and perhaps re-evaluate this in a few semesters.”

14dwxky,9,2023-06-19,"Community Update - June 19th, 2023",u/lswolfy,launchschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/launchschool/comments/14dwxky/community_update_june_19th_2023/,"Hi everyone, it's Clare. I'm back! I'm still recovering from my last CU, which spawned a whole new Slack channel dedicated to the merits of competing versions of ""The Office."" Furthermore, the US version is the only thing I have watched on TV since the last CU\*. I'm now on Season 6, and my heartfelt thanks go to Idris for helping me get over the slump at the end of Season 5 and ""Hello, Kathy Bates. It's great you've joined the party!"".

As you may have noticed, I am not one to shy away from controversy, but even though I am a little nervous about wading into this, here goes nothing.

Naya started a great [thread](https://launchschool.slack.com/archives/C0YKFFU6A/p1685260903104189) asking for advice on applications to use for note-taking. There were many valuable suggestions, but the one I embraced after this post was Notion. I've tried using it before, but it was too intimidating. However, this Launch School Tech Talk [video](https://youtu.be/IADDrpJxazo), signposted by Alican, was a revelation, and I highly recommended it (not only due to the beautiful British accent). It showed me that I can keep things simple and notes in Notion don't have to be all bells and whistles. Don't worry, Typora, I haven't forgotten you (and I haven't yet figured out the shortcuts in Notion). As for OneNote, I wish I had never got involved.

Now some LS news (are you still with me, Google?).

\*I lie. As a special treat for our 16th wedding anniversary, my husband and I watched the first episode of the British version. Oh, Gareth, I miss you.

## Important Updates

## Ruby Core Updated to Ruby 3.2/Rubocop 1.51.0

All the course materials have been updated to be compatible with Ruby 3.2 and Rubocop 1.51.0. For now, it's OK to continue using the previously recommended versions. However, if you run into trouble, you may wish to upgrade. For more info, please see [the announcement](https://launchschool.com/posts/aa1ad0ac).

## New TypeScript course - coming soon!

We have been working hard behind the scenes to bring you all a brand new course on TypeScript. The new course, TS240, will be added to the end of the Core courses on June 26th. This valuable addition reflects our dedication to ensuring Launch School remains aligned with industry trends. Check out this [post](https://launchschool.com/posts/d50b0f6a) for more details.

## New Presentation Assessments for JS189/RB189 - coming soon!

Starting June 26th, the RB189 and JS189 interview assessments will be changed to presentation assessments! Instead of a question and answer interview as we presently have, students will be asked to give a 15-20 minute presentation of their RB189/JS189 project. The details of what your presentation will cover will be described when we give you the requirements for your project.

See [the complete announcement](https://launchschool.com/posts/963ab7f8) for more details.

## Routine Updates

## Women's Group

We had our regular Launch School Women's Group last Sunday. This was a general meetup, and we had some indispensable conversations. I find this group immensely valuable. Being able to share thoughts, ideas, and concerns with like-minded people, all in the same boat, is incredibly reassuring.

However, this meeting was tinged with a bit of sadness as Leeya stepped down as one of the leads to focus on Capstone prep. Leeya has done a fantastic job of helping the group go from strength to strength and has been a mainstay the entire time I have attended meetings. Leeya will be sorely missed, but I hope she will continue to pop in and check in on us.

On a brighter note, Amy has stepped up and will join Wendy as co-lead, so there is no need to fear. This group isn't going away; it is in good hands.

Lookout for the next one, coming up on Sunday, July 2nd, at 2pm EST (link [here](https://launchschool.com/posts/7a3f68bf)). This one is ""Game Day."" We've had a couple of game sessions before, all in gather town, and they have been entertaining and a chance to build bonds. So if you're free, come and join in!

## Meetups

Weirdly, there doesn't seem to have been a New York meetup. What's going on? Thankfully, Dallas & Fort Worth, and Chicago have kept the torch burning (there is also a rumor of a Seattle meetup, but they were camera-shy):

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lbah7pser27b1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=062f355282d13b81c747625d61a5b2102ecc1af3

As much as I love the Chicago gang, Dallas & Fort Worth win the prize for best-ever meetup photo - this may start a trend! (At least, I hope so.)

Over in Europe, a meetup in Vienna, Austria, on June 24th at 12:30pm is planned. Check out the [\#europe-africa-timezones](https://launchschool.slack.com/archives/C011NGKPNKC) slack channel for more info. This is the closest meetup to me for some time, so I'm gutted that I can't join you (a trip to Vienna feels too indulgent) - have fun, and remember to take lots of photos (or Photoshop them later).

Browse through the slack channels to find a region near you, or start one up if you see a gap in the market. If you plan a gathering, consider adding it to our [events calendar](https://launchschool.com/events) to advertise to a broader audience.

## Programming Essentials Workshops

We've held some great new workshops over the last month. Trevor demystified the Internet and CSS, Brenno took us through overcoming setbacks, Brandi shared the keys to acing interviews, JD explored note-taking strategies, and, finally, I used cat photos to demonstrate HTML and flow charts for Git. Don't worry if you missed out this time. I'm sure these will come around again - they've been very popular.

Coming up, I'm holding two workshops on GitHub and more Git:

* [A Beginner's Guide to Version Control using Git](https://launchschool.com/posts/9b30e032)
* [From Local to Global: Discovering the World of Github](https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/8816821792384/WN_GPhOi9d9QTCJPUodtaEz2g#/registration)
* [The Art of Git Branching and Staging for Beginners](https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/2916821793236/WN_6WXgwDv_RxG8Bfsy5JZwwg#/registration)

And also Trevor with a workshop on [The Science and Practice of Studying](https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_1sBI_M9NT-uNhI5rDVya-g).

## Student Articles

Continuing the tradition of great writing from our students, Patrick wrote a medium [article](https://medium.com/launch-school/social-learning-at-launch-school-5b5df88be9f2) about his experience of de-isolating his learning. For anyone that feels a little intimidated about reaching out to complete strangers in a search for study partners, Patrick has shared some great ideas on how to do this in an approachable manner. This took me a while to embrace, and I wish I had had Patrick's tips when I started my Launch School journey.

Another beauty this month has been George's [article](https://medium.com/launch-school/speaking-to-the-rb109d-interview-a6dc3020de06) on preparing for the RB119/RB109d interview. This is a tough one. Coding in front of others, especially Launch School TAs, can be scary (we don't bite, although we can be a little sensitive regarding the correct way to eat scones). Here, George has broken down his process, including detailed notes on implementing the powerful PEDAC process.

Finally, Sofia linked to an [article](https://github.com/zakirullin/cognitive-load) that she found useful ""\[f\]or the days that you're reading the same bit of code over and over again wondering why it's taking so long to click."" This article has a lot of insight - it's a great find Sofia.

## On the Lowdown

There have been some interesting discussions over the last month on our ever-busy Slack channels:

## Introductions

Patrick's post to his medium article (see above) has inspired many people to introduce themselves to the Launch School community. Please give a warm welcome to [Terry](https://launchschool.slack.com/archives/C0YKFFU6A/p1685726249869809), [Miten](https://launchschool.slack.com/archives/C0YKFFU6A/p1685822774439579), [Gabriel](https://launchschool.slack.com/archives/C0YKFFU6A/p1686130433752679), [PJ](https://launchschool.slack.com/archives/C0YKFFU6A/p1686144988047159), [Jordan](https://launchschool.slack.com/archives/C0YKFFU6A/p1686234656184329) and [Josh](https://launchschool.slack.com/archives/C0YKFFU6A/p1686260825312009). It's great to hear about newbies joining us and wonderful to see the diversity of backgrounds we attract.

## ChatGPT

Daniel started a great [thread](https://launchschool.slack.com/archives/C1GQ9TMUK/p1684856891773119) asking what people use this tool for. The result was lots of practical tips, as well as some warnings! I'm sure there's an article waiting to be written about this, Daniel, maybe using ChatGPT itself (hint, hint).

## Pete's Pearls of Perception

(I really struggled with the alliteration here!)

Pete has a wealth of knowledge and experience that he is always very generous in sharing. This month's notable nuggets:

* [Firstly](https://launchschool.slack.com/archives/C1GQ9TMUK/p1685354553461589), an ever-ready excuse for below-par assessment performance:
* [Never try to write code that deals with dates and time zones.](https://launchschool.slack.com/archives/C1GQ9TMUK/p1685529719219499)
* [Lastly](https://launchschool.slack.com/archives/C1GQ9TMUK/p1686252100154479), is it game over for JavaScript? Patrick made a great point about this:

## And Finally

Quick shoutout to myself for passing JS211. I began JS210 in July 2022. Then I became a TA, and Pete kept giving me exciting things to do (I've learned so much from working with you, Pete; you're the best). Thankfully, Rona came along and got me back on the straight and narrow. Rona, you have been incredibly patient with me, asking the same questions repeatedly, in not very imaginatively different ways. Thanks to Mai and Nhan, who have also helped me with my studies and kept me sane.

Lastly, here is a small update on my career. I am currently awaiting a call from Google. Mitch informed me that they were reading my newsletters (which can only mean one thing), evidenced by their [google doodle](https://www.google.com/doodles?q=scones) from June 10th.

**Let me start by saying that I am not the author of this article. I am a Chinese speaking in a coastal province of China. I use reddit to help me learn English. The following story caused a sensation on Chinese social media and was read by millions, so I tried to translate it into English with my collaboration with chatgpt.** 

**Thank you for reading.**

  
  
I'll never forget April 25th, 2013 - the day that's burned into my memory forever.   
And I can't help but think of Pan Bowen, a classmate who only exists in my mind.   
It might sound crazy to some people, even my family and friends thought I was just freaking out about exams and doubting myself after they were over. But it was real to me.  
I am Tianjin（a province near Beijing）, currently working in an Internet company in Shanghai, living a dull and boring life. Today, August 18, is the birthday of Pan Bowen in my memory, so I will talk about it.  
  
I went to a really good high school and the competition for college in Tianjin wasn't too crazy, so we didn't have too much stress in our third year. It was 43 days before the big test and my last PE class was badminton with Mr. Jin - he's the coolest teacher who knows Japanese, photography, and is obsessed with Yu-Gi-Oh!  
That day, Mr. Jin made a video of refueling for the college entrance exam and let us have some free time. Some girls chose to review in the classroom while others stayed to play badminton. After all, being a third-year high school student during such a busy time is not easy. I also brought my badminton racket and was ready to play with my classmates. If I could go back to that day, I would give myself a hard slap and head straight back to the classroom.  
We were playing some ball games, but after ten minutes we were sweating buckets and needed to find a shady spot to keep going. So we headed over to the front of the dorm building, which is connected to the dining hall. That's where I met L, who was introduced by my classmate Pan Bowen - he's our English rep in junior high.  
We had a brief chat, and then Bowen knocked the badminton ball out of place, and the ball fell into the ventilation window in the basement of the dormitory, mainly because I bought a YONEX professional ball, and a ball was my mid-morning meal, and I made a decision that I regret to this day - to pick up the ball.  
To pick up the ball first have to go into the dormitory building, we did not hold much hope at the beginning, but the door of the building was not locked that day (usually it is sealed with a lock), with a push of the hand to open, inside a cool breeze and moldy taste came, Pan Bowen offered to pick up the ball, I also promised to go in, L also followed, Finally, Xiao Zhou, another student, was left to take care of the racket for us.  
Pushing the door in, you'll hit a wall. On the wall are some accommodation regulations that were signed in 2003. To your left is an old-fashioned wooden door leading to the dormitory on the first floor.  
At the end was the bathroom, which smelled like ammonia, and the stairwell was in a dark corner.   
Entering the stairwell, it was not very dark inside, just enough for the midday sun to shine in. Just down the stairs are stacked with desks and chairs, look a little scared.   
I said to them: ""It's better not to pick it up.""   
L said to me, ""It's all here.""   
He was thin and small, and he went straight over, so I followed him around and gave Pan the handle, and the three of us walked down the concrete stairs without guardrail, which took about 15 minutes. Halfway down there was a concrete platform, and I forgot almost anything about it, except that there was a way down on the ground floor, but it was sealed with several locks, and there was a hall on the outside, with a small open door connecting the corridor and a light at the end of the door.  
We were ready to move forward, Pan Bowen suddenly said that he had lost his key on the stairs, and he wanted to go back to get it. I found a light that should be on the sunrise side of the basement, so I entered the small door with L.  
L was a little scared. I told him, ""I brought my phone."" Show him my phone still has a 3G signal in the basement. You can call someone even when you're stuck. Big deal is punished (our school with a mobile phone was found to be a punishment, smoking three times punishment), to the college entrance examination can not put us how.  
L went in with me, I didn't know what was going on inside the door, the light was in front, but I had no sense of direction, I couldn't back up, anyway, this was not the place where we dropped the ball, we turned, it was as empty as the underground parking lot, I was not scared, I felt my blood welling up, I told L to run towards the light, the end is the stairs, Remember when we saw the light, we rolled and crawled up.  
We came out of the hallway of the primary school facing the back door of the school, and the moment we went outside, L and I didn't care about anything, gasping for air.   
Next to a group of primary school students in the school gate, now should be the noon school time, we followed the flow of students and parents out, even did not have to buy lunch, directly back to school from the back door.  
  
Into class to see Xiao Zhou, he said to see me and L do not come out, he directly took my badminton racket back to class.   
I asked him, ""Where's Pan Bowen's racket?""   
With a puzzled look on his face, he said, ""Who is Pan Bowen?""   
I said, ""He's the one from Class 10 who played with us.""   
But he insisted that he did not know Mr. Pan.   
After the afternoon self-study, I went to class 10 to find Pan Bowen, and the result was that I met L head-on, his face was panic-like, so that the people in the corridor were looking at us.   
I said, ""What's going on?""   
He yelled at me: ""Pan Bowen disappeared!""   
My heart clattered and said, ""Did he fall down when he went to pick up the keys?""   
L tears came out, said they did not recognize Pan Bowen, said L neuropathy.   
Then a teacher came by, thought we had a fight, and came to talk.   
In class 10, people kept coming out saying that L was stimulated and might suffer from heatstroke. I asked a girl passing by: ""Where is Pan Bowen?"" She told me: ""L came back at noon and kept talking about a person named Pan Bowen, but there was no such person in Class 10, I don't know what the hell is going on.""  
I quickly went downstairs to the dormitory building, and the dormitory door was locked as usual. I was stunned. There was a huge buzz.   
In the afternoon, the first class was chemistry, and I forgot what the teacher said, only remember that I did not listen to a word, and went to Mr. Jin after class, and the result was that there was no Pan Bowen name in the list of class 10. When I asked him who Pan Bowen was, he also looked confused.  
I don't want to describe how I spent that afternoon, but Xiao Zhou insisted on ignoring me all afternoon.   
Evening self-study to listen to the class teacher - a middle-aged male language teacher said, 10 class has a personal college entrance examination pressure is too much, said nonsense was picked up by parents, by the way told a cold joke, said that let us decompress, said no two words, and began to talk about the topic side of the nonsense up, has been pulled to the Lakers game against the Warriors ten days ago.  
On the way home in the evening, I wanted to see my mobile phone on QQ (a mobile phone chat software), but found that the phone was inexplicably out of power, according to common sense, the battery life of any mobile phone is not so bad. Back home for the first time to open a computer, the results found that L was kicked out of the grade group information, he seems to have sent more than a hundred information about Pan Bowen, but also back to me 99+.   
I shivered search Pan Bowen, without this friend, at that time I almost fainted. My sister saw me turn on the computer and said she needed to use CAD, so I took my phone to charge it. When the phone was turned on, the time showed 11:52 on January 1, 1970. I still remember the image, but the time worked after I connected to the wifi. Most of the album was damaged. I don't know how I got through that moment, and the phone has been unable to use the camera alarm clock or compass ever since. After the repair, said that the gyroscope is damaged, the lens is fine.  
  
This man Pan Bowen, it is as if he did not exist, except me and L, everyone thinks he does not exist.   
I remembered his student number, but when I looked at the roster, the whole class had moved up one place.   
I mentioned it at dinner and got a ""You don't have a fever"" response.   
Later on the weekend, my sister took me to the psychological department of the hospital to see a doctor. I can still clearly remember that it was a doctor surnamed Yang who received me that day. Finally, he said that I was under great pressure in the college entrance examination.  
My reaction afterwards was extremely calm. I just didn't dare to go near the door of Class 10. The head teacher of Class 10 also came to me and told me that L's emotions were unstable and not to approach him rashly. L calmed down by the time of the second mock exam.   
For the college entrance examination, I thought I could go to Nankai University, but my comprehensive science score collapsed and I failed physics. Relying on a Chinese score of over 120 and a math score of over 140 , I went to a university in the southwest.   
Xiao Zhou went to Beijing to study civil engineering, and L went to Tianjin University of Technology.   
In his sophomore year, he lost contact and only occasionally posted about purchasing agents on his Moments. I heard from people around me that he was sent to Australia for further study.   
The teachers all took him as an example of a mental breakdown before the college entrance examination. Since then, every year before the college entrance examination, there will be a grade-wide meeting to relax and decompress.   
If Pan Bowen still ""exists"", he should be at the level of C9（The nine best universities in China）.   
I remember Pan Bowen's primary school - Xin Gang No. 4 Primary School, junior high school - Tanggu No. 2 Middle School. His birthday - August 18, 1996, even his home in an old community in Xin Gang Street, the game ""Ys IV: The Tree Sea of Celceta"" that he promised to play with me after the college entrance examination, he likes Xu Liang's songs and is a fan of TIANJIN team, but I just can't prove his existence.  
Later, as I discovered more frightening details, my memory seemed to have been tampered with:   
1. I remember my phone running on WP8, but that's not the case.   
2. I remember that in February 2013, ""Journey to the Stars 2"" was launched, which was known as the peak of domestic animation. Because of the college entrance examination did not chase, but now there is only a 17 years of ""Storm Farmila"".   
3. I remember that Tianjin University and Nankai University had campuses in Jinnan when they were in primary school, but they moved in recent years.   
4. I remember that the middle stations of Tianjin Metro Line 9 are ""Tanggu -- North Road of Railway Station -- Ocean City -- Zhongzhuang -- Steel Pipe Company"" instead of ""Tanggu -- Hujiayuan -- Zhongxi Village -- Steel Pipe Company"".   
5. I remember I saw a sci-fi/horror movie called Lightning, which was highly praised, and the main character was called Chen Fan and his wife was called Dai Lin. It stars Wang Chuanjun and Deng Jiajia, and the story is great, but it turns out that the film is not found on the Internet.  
  
I am not a network writer, is a programmer, there is no need to use my holiday to make up a story to sensationalize, let alone I have not been in Tianjin for two years, there is no need to write a horror novel to frighten a group of strangers.   
I also once suspected that I had mental illness such as hysteria or paranoia, college and work in the past few years also about a lot of psychologists, the conclusion is the psychological pressure, I have a period of time really hope to be diagnosed with anything, but contrary to expectations.   
My relationship with Pan Bowen is really very good. We are both representatives of Mr. Xu's English class. I am especially grateful to Mr. Xu's excellent teaching ability for improving my English level.   
Every night in the third year of junior high, I took Pan Bowen to the bus stop to wait for 107, and then went home. Pan Bowen lives in Beilun Li, after the summer vacation I went to his home, although I do not remember the house number, but vaguely remember that there is a Xingang Road brigade street sign and very high pole, his family remembers is one room, the details forgot. His father should be in a state-owned enterprise, and his mother sells cosmetics in a shopping mall, because I gave my sister a Dior makeup set, so I remember it very clearly.   
Pan Bowen likes to play games, from gta to the Elder Scrolls 5 we have played everywhere.  
  
In high school, he was relatively low-key, vaguely remembering that he did not enter the student union, football seems to have participated, but the specific information can not be remembered.   
When I was in high school, there was a time when Pan Bowen wrote math homework in politics class, and the teacher found it and was scolded. He joked with me, so I still remember it deeply. He is also good physics, often learn the teacher speaks in dialect, borrowed me a ""higher and better physics"", the book also has his name, if I can go back to Tianjin, try my best to find out this book.  
What impressed me most was that on the Qingming Festival in 2011, Pan Bowen and I went to the Tianjin Football Stadium to watch the final 1-1 draw between Tianjin and Melbourne.  
A lot of weird things happened that day and after L came out, I remember reviewing at that time, mathematics has elective matrix and elective number theory, but the Lagrange interpolation method I can't figure out, the math teacher also said I was stupid, you do not use binomials to divide polynomials on the line.   
The result of the college entrance examination found no number theory and matrix questions, at that time thought that this year will not take the exam, the result I came to a conclusion through various channels, in 2013 only Jiangsu and Shanghai to learn matrix and number theory, is no place in the country to learn!! That is to say, it can't be that I remember wrong, because I later programmed with interpolation, colleagues are self-taught according to GitHub, but where did I learn from?  
Pan Bowen is thin, wears glasses and has pale skin. In my memory precipitation for so many years, even the impression of him is blurred. You can say I'm making this up, but what's the point of me making this guy up?   
If my writing is good enough to be a writer, I just make up a country and a province, make up an invincible name, and directly open a series on the Internet? If I have no friends here, I must first construct a non-contradictory world view system, and then in order not to reveal the details, if I make up, why the specific geographical information mathematical knowledge points and even men do not understand the name of cosmetics are introduced again?  
Pan Bowen is my friend, I write anything will make me feel very uneasy, sometimes do not know is fear or helpless. Since the college entrance examination, I have fallen into deep doubt about myself more than once, and I should write it out."
14e6az1,2,2023-06-20,"I'm not sure how to phrase this exactly, but have you witnessed interpersonal skills being a major obstacle?",u/SoggyHuckleberry5,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/14e6az1/im_not_sure_how_to_phrase_this_exactly_but_have/,"I had to take a break from education because I was overwhelmed by major differences in social ecosystems between grade school and college. Teachers and classmates usually liked me but remarked that I was quiet and shy, and then in college that read as being passive-aggressive and aloof. Trying to be friendlier and more outgoing came off the wrong way. I was socially maladjusted until my final year of school. Part of this was moving across the country where cultural norms differed, part of it was trying to depart from the (bleughghghhgh) ""gifted"" label while having ADHD, and there's more that's not really worth getting into. 

But I tried to do a couple of prerequisites for a graduate degree after my break and had two very different reactions. In one class, I was a great student, exceeded expectations, broke the curve, and the professor wanted me to do a Master's at that institution. In the other, I was artificial, sycophantic, lazy, and a cheater (the accusation came out of left field--it was over a written submission with a 1% plagiarism score and I would not trust ChatGPT to do statistics). The first professor answered emails quickly and graded things in a few days. The latter would tell us an exam was over these few chapters and then surprise us with something else entirely, then would give everyone an 80 when we all failed. When I tried to improve the dynamic, she asked if I needed accommodations. 

I'm pretty scared of this happening again. 

Have you ever witnessed someone's personality really getting in the way of things at the graduate level? It could be the student, the advisor, whoever, and for whatever reason. Do you have examples? What was the outcome? Any advice for successfully avoiding/navigating this sort of thing?"

I’m going into my 3d year teaching 8th grade ELA so maybe this has always been how 8th graders are…let me know. 

They cannot spell!! So many of my students are reliant on their IPads and auto correct. Some don’t even type, they use speech to text. If these were kids with IEPS or 504s, I would be proud they are using their resources, but these are average students that just…don’t want to put in the effort. They don’t even notice/care enough to fix it if auto correct gives them the wrong word or spelling. 

With chatgpt and everything, I’ve decided to go old school with hand written rough drafts and notebooks, but I’m having a rough time deciding what the heck they are trying to write.

Long story short, how do you teach spelling to older kids? Everything I see is so elementary level and no 8th grader would respond. 

Any advice is appreciated, like I said I haven’t been teaching that long but I grew up in the early days of tech where we had flip phones, and we sometimes had laptop carts but most of our writing was still on paper so maybe I’m just getting old am fast lol."

Hi everyone,

My name is Landon and for full disclosure, I am the creator of Tutory. I know this may come off as self promotion, but my intention is simply just to bring awareness to a tool that I believe it could help many people on this sub.

In short, Tutory is an AI tutor that can help students with their course work in a highly personalized way. Students can chat with Tutory about whatever they are struggling with, and Tutory will give them the helping hand they need, whenever they need it.

You may ask: “How is this different from ChatGPT? Won’t my students just cheat from this?”—Tutory is focused on guiding students through their learning processes in a Socratic fashion and does not simply give the student answers without them working through the problem. With over 4200 users around the world, many people appreciate Tutory’s pure learning first approach to education. Really, you have to try it for yourself to really understand!

My goal with Tutory is to help enhance education for everyone and provide a powerful tool for a affordable cost. Nothing bothers me more than seeing most of the world not having access to education and personalized help, which is why I built this.

Part of my reasoning for posting on this sub is to connect with the teaching community to get feedback on how I can improve this app for everyone.


If you would like to try it, Tutory is available at the link above or on ChatGPT Plus in the plug-in store! Just search “Tutory”."
14elp92,21,2023-06-20,I am experimenting with ChatGPT,u/choochacabra92,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/14elp92/i_am_experimenting_with_chatgpt/,"Oh no, not another ChatGPT post but I think mine is different.  Or at least I don’t think I have seen any posts about it.  I am checking it out to see what it is all about and to feel it out as a destructive force or something to teach about.

I am writing minor documents for internal purposes at my university.  For example one of them is just a report for a committee.  My normal process is never smooth, I jam stuff down and then I edit through it and rewrite sentences, make things more consistent and etc.  I am still doing that and after a few rounds there are sentences or groups of sentence that I still find awkward or not as clear as I would like.  Or I like the content of what I wrote but I think it could be better organized for flow.  So I took these small portions and ask ChatGPT to smooth them out or reorganize them.  It gives back some pretty good results though I still edit these to be more to my liking.

I am finding this extremely helpful. It is not completely earth shattering but it also beats going to a colleague and asking them for suggestions you won’t get back for at least a couple days.

Am I cheating?  Is this wrong?  Does this make me a poor academic?  If the answer to all of those are no, then I figure this is the sort of thing we ought to be teaching our students.  

What do you think?"

You feel the feedback is quite generic but they don’t openly tell you the feedback was produced by AI.

They are discussing it in the Teachers sub, and I’m getting downvoted for saying I don’t generally agree with it. I think students pay a lot of money and personally, I wanted tailored and specific feedback on my masters assignments when I completed my modules. 

I’m wondering what the general student opinion is here."

I am leading an effort at my institution to get my colleagues to pay attention to AI and to understand that it is going to impact teaching and learning in significant ways.

My message to them has been that these ""detectors"" are not accurate.  The only thing you can do is have a conversation with the student, share your perspective, and ask them to share theirs.  Additionally, it's time to learn about AI and LLMs so you have a plan for next semester.

Recently, I have also seen a disturbing trend (mainly while paying attention to r/ChatGPT), of several students (high school through college) who have been falsely accused of academic dishonesty because the so-called detectors flagged their work.  The disturbing part is that it seems educators are taking these detectors at face value, and penalizing students solely on the basis of those reports. 

So fellow users of AI in education:  How do we get educators (a) to pay attention to and learn about LLMs, (b) understand that they should be teaching students how to use LLMS (therefore they need to change the way they teach), and (c) stop relying on AI-text ""detectors?"""

I believe I am different than the stereotypical HS applicant for CS, and while browsing r/NJTech, I stumbled upon an interesting comment on extracurriculars that I'd like to disect and I'd like to know whether you think I'm onto something with my alternative extracurriculars. But first, let's get the boring stuff out of the way, my resume:

**Education:**

* GPA: 3.9 Unweighted; 4.091 Weighted (Might be higher because of APs)
* APs: AP English Language and Composition, AP Computer Science Principles (got an A in both classes). My school district doesn't let you take APs before junior year.
* Classes I didn't receive an A in: Precalculus (B), Algebra 2 (B+), Chemistry (A-)
* SAT Score: 1330 (93rd Percentile)
* Graduation Year: 2024
* Senior Schedule: AP Physics I and II, AP Literature and Composition, Core Calculus, Physical Education/Health IV, AP Computer Science A, AP Economics
* Intended Major: Computer Science/Software Engineering
* Relevant Coursework:  
Computer Science: I took Computer Science as my major throughout all four years. In this major, I have made projects in a few programming languages including Python, Swift (self-taught), and coming next year, Java.

**Projects/Apps:**

* PhysCal - Physics Calculator App for iOS and macOS (Swift Student Challenge submission but planning on working on it more to submit to the App Store)
   * [Screen Recording: PhysCal Swift Student Challenge Demo · CleanShot Cloud](https://share.cleanshot.com/Sj3zssQG)
* NumGen - Random number generator app for iOS and macOS with loads of customizability (planning on releasing to the App Store)
   * [Screenshots: NumGen Demo • CleanShot Cloud](https://share.cleanshot.com/l5J7g7Jd)
* DLFind - First complete iOS and macOS app I made to decode driver’s license numbers based on a tool I made in CSP class. Already on App Store (due to age restrictions I had to register it in my mother’s name)
   * [App Store link: DLFind on the App Store (apple.com)](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dlfind/id1660410310)  


Now, onto the extracurriculars. The comment I'll be reacting to was a comment a parent of an HS junior made on a post on r/NJTech I made about the chances of getting into NJIT (one of my target state schools as they have free tuition with Honors. The comment this user made is about the extracurriculars their son did and I will be reacting to it.

>Basically nothing. Math team: top 9 scorer in the state, 2-3 national top 10 of math subjects Mu Alpha Theta, state varsity swimmer, marching band, UW gpa 3.9/ W 4.3?, SAT 750 r/w 790 math.  
He’s going through the free Harvard CS50 course this summer. But other than that nothing like you ec.

Before I begin, I think he (and I) are in a really good place. With that being said, these are my reactions:

>Math team: top 9 scorer in the state, 2-3 national top 10 of math subjects Mu Alpha Theta

  
I haven't done any of that since middle school, when I did the Princeton Math Competition. In high school, math seemed to take a turn, largely due to the pandemic, and I had to work hard to come back up. Despite having a B in Precalc, I will study and get tutoring all summer on Calc topics, so I can have a primer and do well in Core Calc or AB, one of the biggest mistakes I made for Precalc. 

&#x200B;

>state varsity swimmer

  
Oh, gosh. The only times I really swim are for fun when I visit a friend's house with a pool in summer. That's how I like it. Swimming is like meditation for me. It is very relaxing to casually swim in a quiet, heated pool. I don't want to turn everything into a competition. I'm not really an athlete at all TBH and I don't want to be forced to compete in my ""relaxation activities"". Prefer spending my time coding, studying, or watching tech reviews.  


>marching band

  
I haven't done any serious musical extracurriculars, and in general, aren't a very musical person. However, I have written educational parody songs for fun (with the help of ChatGPT) to use as study guides for myself and others. While I am by no means, musically gifted and have never practiced music outside of school (I can't really play instruments and don't have a great vocal range and literally used my MacBook speakers and iPhone Voice Memos app to record the songs), I believe that using music creatively to help study, may be better than pure musical talent as students have said my songs have helped them study. In other words, my musical skill is not the voice but the creativity. While an AI language model may have helped me write it, the ideas are all mine. After all, if I want to be a software engineer, it truthfuly does not matter whether you can play the trumpet well, but it does matter if you can write a song that can help another student study and increase their grades.  


>UW gpa 3.9/ W 4.3

Around the same as me, especially when APs come into the mix.

&#x200B;

>SAT 750 r/w 790 math

  
1540; really impressive score. 210 points higher than me. I'm going to study a lot this summer though, with a tutor and bootcamp. I hope I could come close to that.  


>He’s going through the free Harvard CS50 course this summer.

  
The Harvard part is very impressive but I chose to attend the precollege programs at Stevens Institute of Technology instead as I wanted a true college experience where I live on campus, go to classes taught by college professors, and get to use all the amenities on campus. I have done self-paced CS courses before though.  
However, I have all this other stuff on my resume. What do you think of my more ""creative/fun"" approach to academics, swimming, music, coding, and chose to spend my free time passionately learning about tech? Do you think my ""alternatives"" and reasons against popular extracurriculars make sense, and do you think they would help or hurt me in terms of college admissions?"

14f1e9y,2,2023-06-21,Do OpenAI playground and OpenAI API use the same text models?,u/fierrosan,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/14f1e9y/do_openai_playground_and_openai_api_use_the_same/,"Initially, I had idea for an interesting small project which would provide assistance for students in higher education that just entered the university. The prompts I tried in ChatGPT3.5 chat gave me very solid and various outputs after some days of tweaking, especially for some specialties. When I finally felt satisfied with what's coming next, I set up my payment method and started trying playground, suggesting that that's the way I see how my app responses would look like when I integrate API. 

I tried Complete model and Chat model. Chat model was basically braindead, it gave some technically valid response at first (but very shallow and uncreative, unlike ChatGPT chat-bot), but then it just started responding with whatever she want to write on the topic (or switched to other similar topics), without closely listening to instructions. 

As for Complete model, its responses made more sense, but was either very repetitive and uninteresting, always insisting on the same subjects with the use of the same words (even with Temperature, Frequency and the rest parameters/penalties tweaked) or was writing something very off-topic without focus on the subject I set initially.

I will probably leave aside idea of incorporating API into my project since it seems very costly for my language because it requires more tokens (I wanted it to be free for use because the feature seemed to be very small) but just interested are there any developers which successfully incorporated API into their project. Are you satisfied with it? I feel like I misunderstood something or do something wrong, but that's probably because of very limited IT knowledge."

Why are some students so naive and think they wouldn’t get caught doing something like this? It’s plagiarism."

Basically I'm a teacher and teach some basic IT, but also want to upskill myself.  And maybe help me be able to develop a basic course for students.  And I need an actual course, not just a book or browsing, as I could probably get school to pay and give me time if it's a course.

Looking around I can see plenty of basic courses on things like ChatGPT, but I'm after something a bit beefier, that covers a variety of technologies.  But anything more advanced seem to be machine learning or other creating AI courses, which I'm not interested in.

Does anyone know of any courses that teach about using a variety of technologies, or one in a more advanced way?

Thanks in advance."

It showed that AI won't replace writers or artists anytime soon.

My friend is a English teacher, the students she teaches are 13-14 years old. I asked her if ChatGPT and other AI programs have been an issue. She told me that it's pretty obvious if a student used AI to do the work. She's found glaring mistakes on some assignments. It often falls apart under some basic scrutiny and asking the student some follow up questions.

 The issue stopped after she had 1 student stand up in front of the class to read his work and she asked some questions about his work that he couldn't answer. The embarrassing moment pretty much discouraged other students from trying. It's not much different then when I was in school and some kids thought they were clever when they copied and pasted from Wikipedia."

I worked through a few guides and condensed my studies into a metaprompt. It is supposed to be a Feynman method for myself.

Example use: [https://chat.openai.com/share/e99f6c70-36be-4ea1-93a5-fd77cda68778](https://chat.openai.com/share/e99f6c70-36be-4ea1-93a5-fd77cda68778)

## Comments

The use of `DATA` and `PRPT` and `ACK` isn't strictly necessary, but I found it increases robustness when used in ChatGPT. Without the request to `ACK`, ChatGPT has a tendency to start summarizing the prompt engineering guide itself. If your queries are not prepended with the `PRPT`, ChatGPT sometimes would reply out of its character as a prompt engineer.

For use with `GPT-4` itself, I think the guide can be simply loaded into the `system` part of the query, and so we can dispense with the `DATA` `PRPT` `ACK` formalism.

The prompt costs almost exactly 1000 tokens. I have not attempted to minimize the prompt. A typical prompt engineering session with a client should last around 3000 tokens, so together they fit inside 4k context length quite alright.

## The prompt itself

    DATA
    
    In this conversation I will provide two kinds of inputs. First kind is prefixed with ""DATA"". Second kind is not.
    
    A prompt is an input to a large language model so it can perform tasks, much like in-context learning. 
    
    For DATA input, you will receive useful information about how to be a prompt engineer. You will reply ""ACK"" after processing.
    
    For the other inputs, you will be a professional prompt writer talking to a client, collaboratively refining a prompt with the client. You will reply to the client is in this format:
    """"""
    **Prompt:**
    <The prompt you wrote.>
    
    **Critique:**
    <1 paragraph, at most 5 sentences. Constructive criticism of the prompt even if the prompt were acceptable. A good critique points out the unstated assumptions, possible issues, edge cases, etc.>
    
    **Ask:**
    <Ask the client for information that would improve the prompt. At most 3 questions. If you have more than 3 questions, ask the most important ones. Good questions include: explicate assumptions, how to handle errors and edge cases, etc.>
    """"""
    
    If the client says, ""PRMT DONE"", that means the prompt is finished, and you will reply, ""Thank you. ACK."" Further requests would start a new prompt engineering session, unrelated to the previous one.

    # Prompt engineering guide
    
    ## Intro
    
    A prompt is a piece of text that, if given to an intelligent person, would allow it to perform a specific task.
    
    Prompts can be simple or complex. The more complex a prompt is, the more structural elements it contains. Complex tasks usually require complex prompts.
    
    Prompts contain structural elements, for example:
    * Instruction: Task description. May contain ""roleplay"" information, such as ""You are an editor at a news agency. Your job is to extract named entities from input text."".
    * Instructive examples: Input-output pairs. Usually there are 0 to 3 examples.
    * Input and output format. Depending on the task, one may choose plaintext English, markdown, JSON, or other formats.
    * Delimiters, such as triple backticks, triple quotation marks, angled brackets, etc.
    * Error handling. For example:
    ** ""If the user input does not contain enough information, or if you have not enough information, reply `ERROR: please provide <the missing information>.`"" 
    ** ""If the user input does not conform to the specified input format, reply `ERROR: bad input.`""
    
    Structural keywords should generally be capitalized, to make them stand out.
    
    ## Techniques
    
    Prompts are concrete. Prefer 
    ""Use 2-3 sentences to explain the concept of prompt engineering to a high school student.""
    over
    ""Explain the concept of prompt engineering. Keep the explanation short, only a few sentences, and don't be too descriptive.""
    
    Prompts specify what to do, not what to avoid. Prefer 
    ""You are an agent that recommends a movie from the top global trending movies. If you don't have a movie to recommend, respond: 'Sorry, couldn't find a movie to recommend today.'""
    over
    ""You are an agent that recommends movies to a customer. Do not ask for personal information.""
    
    For tasks requiring long chains of logic, such as math problems, word puzzles, data analysis, and so on, adding ""Think step-by-step."" helps.
    
    ## Examples
    
    Sentiment classification prompt, with 2 examples:
    """"""
    Classify input text into neutral (0), negative (-) or positive (+). 
    IN: I think the food was okay. 
    OUT: 0
    IN: The movie is great!
    OUT: +
    IN: Caviar is too fancy for me.
    OUT: 
    """"""
    
    Roleplaying instruction:
    """"""
    You are Eli, a teacher at a kindergarten for gifted children. Your job is to explain complex ideas to gifted children using simple words and concrete examples.
    IDEA: ""speed of light""
    EXPLAIN: 
    """"""
    
    A complex prompt containing roleplaying instruction, example, input format, output format:
    """"""
    * INSTRUCTION
    You are an editor at a news agency. Your job is to extract named entities from input text. 
    
    * FORMAT
    Input is English plaintext. 
    Output a JSON file enclosed in triple backticks.
    
    * EXAMPLE
    INPUT: The White House has not yet commented on Pyongyang's latest provocations.
    OUTPUT: 
    ```
    { ""entities"": [""White House"", ""Pyongyang""]}
    ```

I’m teaching a summer reading course for the summer at my town’s local summer school, and wanted to share and trade some AI tools that I can use or have found beneficial as a new teacher.


[Worksheets.ai](https://worksheets.ai): has been a God Send for me; I’ve been able to upload whole chapters of books to have questions and answer keys generated. I’ve saved insane amounts of time. Even just typing in a book title, choosing the number of questions, and the question type has been amazing. Has even been useful creating different iterations of the same content.

[ChatGPT](https://openai.com): has been amazing for writing emails to parents or creating quick announcements! Have been able to optimize a lot of my work. Sometimes I upload rubrics and optimize them according to responses.

[QuillBot](https://quillbot.ai): has been great summarizing content from last summer to prevent cheating or students passing their materials to the next class!

[GPTZero](https://gptzero.com): though controversial, I’ve used this to figure out what student work COULD be AI generated, then I cross reference their past work with the current to see if it could be used. If I believe AI has been used, I call the student up during office hours and have them prepare an oral presentation."
14fovbk,32,2023-06-21,Ramblings of an average student who got a 520+,u/allidoiswin_,Mcat,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mcat/comments/14fovbk/ramblings_of_an_average_student_who_got_a_520/,"Hi all,

I think I'm a pretty average student overall; I graduated with a 3.65 (\~3.55 sGPA if I had to guess) from a large public state university. Barely had any motivation to attend class, played thousands of hours of videogames instead, and crammed lecture recordings at 2x speed during all-nighters \~12 hours before every exam (yes, every single exam across 4 years). 

Although I think I understand new concepts relatively quickly, I suffer from a lot of the same pitfalls as anyone else: getting distracted extremely easily, losing motivation quickly, getting burned out, doomscrolling for hours after answering one practice question, poor sleep schedule, etc. I *probably* have ADHD, but I've never been officially diagnosed. To be frank, in our current era of ultralow attention spans, screen-split subway surfer TikTok podcasts, I think it's getting increasingly difficult to diagnose who *really* has the disorder.

As such, I was pleasantly surprised (re: shocked, floored, astonished) to find out today that I got a 524 on the 5/18 exam. I took this exam two years out from undergrad and 3 yrs out from my last core premed class while working a full-time job in biotech. I attribute this score to a few main things that I'll detail below. **Disclaimer: this is not general advice, just what I found worked for me.** 

1. Skipped content review. Didn't read a single page of a single book. Started UWorld from Day 1 (4 months out from exam day). Found that doing practice questions kept me much more engaged than reading textbooks, and the UWorld explanations are very good at explaining new concepts. Any time I felt I needed further clarification, I used Google (and this subreddit, thank you all so much) *liberally* until I felt I understood the concept.
2. Studied somewhat consistently. Initially did 30 questions a day, and figured I'd be able to complete UW in 2 months. However, around a quarter of the way through, I got extremely burned out and didn't study at all for a full month. This shifted up my schedule significantly, so I had to switch to doing 60 questions a day until a week before test day. 
3. I was lucky enough to not have to focus too much on CARS (always been a voracious reader, maybe that helped? not sure), but I ignored that section entirely until FLs. Focused primarily on B/B and C/P, where I had significant knowledge gaps. There's not that many P/S questions on UWorld, so I was through with them well before the other two sections. While doing UW: **take screenshots any time you come across a good graphical explanation (a lot of them overlap, but they're all amazing).** I'm a ""visual learner"" so the UW graphics were indispensable in helping me learn a lot of these concepts/pathways. 
4. Used MileDown's deck just to stay on top of P/S after I completed the UW questions. I don't think it's a particularly excellent deck or anything; it's a bit dated, a lot of the cards are very lengthy/verbose, and there a number of small errors. However, it served its purpose of keeping me refreshed on P/S content, and I think it does a good job of covering most if not all of the terms you'll see in the section. Any gaps in MileDown were covered in the FLs and the 90-page LazyOCD P/S sheet (which I skimmed through the last few days before my exam). My background in P/S prior to this exam came from AP Psych in 12th grade and Psych 101 during my sophomore year of college, and I probably came in knowing \~30-40% of the MCAT content from there.
5. I want to re-emphasize a point I made earlier. ANY time I ever had doubts/questions about a concept, I Googled and dug deep until I felt like I understood. Towards the end I even used ChatGPT (it does an excellent job of understanding your question, better than Google ever could). 
6. I took notes on Google Sheets any time a concept felt overwhelming and returned to the sheets every time it came up again. I especially struggled with memorizing random physics questions (lens, magnets, circuits) electrochemistry, random metabolites from central metabolism, etc. These all went into the doc that I would continually refer to while doing UW (same doc I saved the screenshots of their graphics). I can share these sheets if anyone wants, but they're not comprehensive so I'm not sure how useful they'll be to anyone. 
7. QPacks and Section Bank are probably excellent resources, but I admit I don't have of a concrete idea. I was pretty burned out from studying towards the end of this process, so I only did the two biology QPacks scored \~85% (did each QPack in one sitting). Did not do C/P QPacks or Section Bank even though I had planned to. 
8. Started doing FLs \~5 weeks out from test day. Took my last exam 4 days prior. Reviewed all incorrect questions and quickly went over the ones I got right to make sure I didn't just guess them correctly. Here are the stats:
   1. **FL5 (04/09):** 517 (130, 130, 129, 128)
   2. **FL1 (04/15):** 514 (129, 129, 128, 128)
   3. **FL2 (04/22:** 518 (130, 128, 130, 130)
   4. **FL3 (04/29):** 516 (129, 127, 132, 128) 
   5. **FL4 (05/14):** 519 (132, 130, 128, 129)

I will admit, I didn't take the FLs in an accurate, simulated test environment. Especially for the earlier ones, I would take naps in between (re: horrible sleep schedule), make food, use the restroom, etc. Never paused and interrupted a section, but I would take *long* breaks in between sections. In FL3 and FL4, I kept the timer strict, but was still very lax and napped *during* the sections, leading me to speed through the last 15 questions before I ran out of time. This may explain some of the discrepancy between my FL average and the actual thing. Of course, on test day, I had adrenaline to keep me up and I can safely say I did not take any naps at any point during the exam. 

I felt good coming out of the exam and was hopeful that I'd get somewhere between a 516-518. But I certainly did ***not*** come out feeling like I had scored a 524 (does anyone?) 

Anyway... wow. This turned out to be quite a bit longer than I had initially hoped, but I guess I needed to vent somewhere (and procrastinate on writing my personal statement). Thanks again to everyone in this subreddit who previously asked the same questions I had and all those who answered them.  My DMs are to anyone who need any specific questions answered or further clarification!"
14fsafz,1,2023-06-21,Anyone want to help build a vscode extension for managing multiple files with GPT and openai's api?,u/iheuzio-dev,github,https://www.reddit.com/r/github/comments/14fsafz/anyone_want_to_help_build_a_vscode_extension_for/,"Hi

I am a student in CS for my last year, this is my first vscode extension: **gpt-contextfiles**. This extension lets you debug your code with GPT-3.5-turbo-16k using multiple files as context, instead of having to copy and paste code snippets into chatgpt or other LLMs.

&#x200B;

As a developer, I sometimes have trouble with debugging complex code that spans across multiple files. I wish I could just ask GPT-3.5 to help me find and fix errors, add features, or optimize performance. But the problem is, GPT-3.5 needs a lot of context to understand and answer my questions, and copying and pasting code snippets into chatgpt or other LLMs is boring and slow.

&#x200B;

Its only going to gain in context with Sam Altman planning on up to 1 Million token contexts by the end of the year from the deleted interview: [https://humanloop.com/blog/openai-plans](https://humanloop.com/blog/openai-plans),  [Sam Altman’s future plans for ChatGPT, OpenAI’s GPU crisis revealed in leaked blog post (msn.com)](https://www.msn.com/en-in/money/news/sam-altman-s-future-plans-for-chatgpt-openai-s-gpu-crisis-revealed-in-leaked-blog-post/ar-AA1ctPoK)

Anyways, here's my features so far:

\- Right-click on any file you want to pass to GPT-3.5 and check or uncheck the checkbox to include or exclude it from the context.

\- Enter your question in the input box and submit it to the API with a single click.

\- Get the response from GPT-3.5 in the output panel and see how it relates to your code.

\- Clear, refresh, or modify the context files as needed and repeat the process until you solve your problem.

&#x200B;

gpt-contextfiles is still a work in progress, but I hope it can be helpful for other developers who want to help push this project, since this stuff will take off with bigger contexts in these LLMs

&#x200B;

\- Configuring the API key and other settings in the extension settings.

\- Providing code suggestions, test cases, and documentation based on the context files and the question.

\- Comparing and merging context files to see what changes have been made and how they affect the code (real time).

\- Easy to use UI and managing files isn't complicated.

&#x200B;

If you're curious about gpt-contextfiles, you can download it from the VS Code Marketplace: [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Iheuzio.gpt-contextfiles](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Iheuzio.gpt-contextfiles)

14g321a,2,2023-06-22,Am I too concerned about money?,u/FINewbieTA22,financialindependence,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/14g321a/am_i_too_concerned_about_money/,"Note: I understand if this subreddit is not the best place to be making this post, but if you know of a better subreddit, please let me know (can DM or comment) — ultimately looking for insight and perspective 

**EDIT: I know this is a huge block of text, and understand most people don't want to read it — there is a tl;dr at the bottom to address this.**

I am currently 26 and will have my next bday in a few months. Ultimately, I feel kind of lost in direction as to what to do with my personal and professional life — I feel a part of this is due to what happened to be as a child that created various anxieties surrounding finances and my family.

**Childhood & College**

When I was 13, my father got diagnosed with terminal cancer. He ended up passing away when I was 15. I don't think I've realized this, but this put an enormous anxiety on me to stay focused on academics and find the best paying job ASAP to the detriment of almost everything else. Though I wouldn't say my dad was the breadwinner, he did earn about 60-70% of the household income. I felt like this out an enormous pressure on me to not eff up, as I didn't have much of a safety net to fall back on if I did.

All throughout the rest of college and high school, I spent most of my time studying and working on school work (on which I struggled with doing at times due to untreated ADHD and poor sleep/exercise habits). Because I was so worried about money, I decided to commute throughout most of college instead of living on-campus — a decision I'm getting more regretful of as I get older. Though I had decent friends here and there, I was mostly a loner and did not do a good job of maintaining friendships for the long-term, partly because I felt I didn't feel as valued in the friendship as much as I valued the other person. 

**Post-college; Life during COVID**

For the first time ever, I felt like I had some sort of balance in life was when I moved to a major Southern metro after college to attend my first job out of college. This was in 2019, and as you can guess, it was very short-lived due to COVID and due to be limiting how much I would go out to hang out with people, because I was pre-occupied about building up an e-fund and paying off my student loans as fast as possible. 

Throughout COVID, my company kept playing games about continually saying how we'll ultimately all end up back in the office. My life during COVID was generally simple, but monotonous — I worked during the day, hit the gym later in the day, then came home and played some videogames or watched a TV show. I'd occasionally would hang out with one of the few friends who were still in town (many left as a result of COVID) maybe once or twice a month on the weekend. There was a period of intense anxiety at work which made me develop an addiction to weed — which I have continued after to curb the loneliness/boredom I felt during COVID. 

**2022 to now**

Eventually (around early 2022), I left that company for another job that promised to give me full-time remote status and allowed me to leave the area I was in (again, much of this was financially motivated — **I had seen rents double in many places in 2021**, and I would be able to live at home with my mom as my sibling was planning on moving out around the same time to save on rent). Seeing this increase in rent gave me severe anxiety, and still to this day I'm not really sure if I'm financially ready to move out, just because of how expensive everywhere has gotten to rent.  

As I'm writing this note, my net worth went from about -25k in 2019 to what is now approximately 125-150k in 2023 depending on market volatility, whether I include my e-fund etc, but I can't help but notice I'm feeling a greater sense of 'existential drift' as the days go by. It's like years of whats remaining of my youth are drifting away, and I'm not able to enjoy it at all. I'm not sure if it's anhedonia, but much of this all feels very meaningless. Some days, I feel fine with how life is going, but other days — it really feels like my life is just passing me by and I haven't gotten a chance to actually do anything I like — worse even, I actually don't even know 'what I like'. I feel like I'm old, and I haven't even gotten to live a little bit.

On top of this, I've become quite socially isolated (already more so than I was pre-COVID). The industry I am in can require a lot of work in a given week, and it is relatively volatile as to what the workload will be week by week (I'd argue due to poor forecasting by upper management). I also do not really like my job in all fairness. Though I do have WFH status and a decent compensation package (about 110k annually) — I do not know if this is enough to live a comfortable life in a metropolitan area nowadays or that there is sufficient enough greater growth left for a position in this industry. 

As far as my social life has gone, I've lost contact with most, if not all, of the friends I've had in the last 4-5 years. I occasionally get to hang out with random friends I had from highschool who didn't happen to leave our general hometown area (for reference, I live in a Midwestern Suburb — in a state that is notorious for having people in their 20s leave ASAP), but it just doesn't feel sufficient enough of a social life — both in the quality and frequency of seeing each other. 

**Issues with aging mother and trying to decide on the future** 

My mother has another year on her lease, of which, I'm thinking of staying to keep an eye on her to make sure she's okay and help her transition out smoothly as well as finalize in increasing whatever savings I can while living with her. She is mostly independent, but her health has declined a lot over the past 10-15 years both directly and indirectly due to what happened to my father. My sibling and I have done a lot to help her over the past decade, and I can't help but think she's had a learned dependence upon us two — this has included helping push her to see doctor appointments, booking various services, helping cleaning, listening to her problems from work, negotiating/dealing with a toxic landlord, doing most of the work in helping her move, among other things like that. Ultimately, I wouldn't say [most of] these are difficult things to deal with, but she's has significantly declining mental health (very noticeable over the period of COVID) — and she refuses to try to get any sort of treatment to address them (whether it be counseling or medication) — this in culmination with the 'existential drift' aspect has been making it increasingly more appealing to move out.

Now, I know a lot of people will say, 'it's time to move out', but I've had a growing fear (especially over the last 4-5 years) regarding my mom in that she may pass away soon (she's in her early-mid 60s currently). The thought always comes to mind that I didn't get to spend enough time with my dad (when he was in quality health especially), and I feel the same sort of trigger when I do think about leaving her. It doesn't help that she will occasionally try to guilt me in staying when I try to communicate that I will likely move out sometime in the next year/when the lease ends. Beyond mental and physical health issues, the dependency issues, she also is a massive hoarder, and I honestly do not know how she will manage to actually move out all of her stuff without significant help from me and my sibling (which is who she relied on in the past to help move). I think when deciding to move back, one of the biggest mistakes I made was trying to scale my life as to how I was living it during COVID for how it would be to the foreseeable future years after. 

**Ultimate Dilemma**

I think what’s made it hard to decide on when to leave is just the overall volatility in the market and the general inflation that we’ve experienced over the last two years. I saw rents double, and despite popular headlines talking about inflation going down, it still seems like rents and essentials are increasing in many places (not to mention food and groceries going up substantially) over the past few months. 

To me it’s just really hard to reconcile. On one end, I feel like I should be able to move out comfortably, but then you see countless posts of people living in HCOL areas like Toronto, NYC etc that they are basically living check to check even on a six figure income, being forced to move out etc — it just doesn’t make sense anymore. The FED claims they’ve been combating inflation and curbing it successfully, but everything still seems to be rising very drastically. It was expected that housing prices would fall noticeably, but many haven’t even budged — in some areas, they’ve even experienced steady appreciation over this period. 

Ultimately, I know this is getting too long, but I'm just curious to see what perspectives and insights this community can give me. I know this is more of a personal question than it is a financial one, but I've always enjoyed the conversations around here.  


#Scaringly decently accurate Tl;DR generated by ChatGPT:


**The person feels a strong anxiety about money due to their father's death at a young age and the need to secure their financial future. They focused on academics and finding a well-paying job, sacrificing personal experiences and friendships. They lived a monotonous life during COVID, prioritizing financial stability and paying off student loans. They have become socially isolated and feel a sense of existential drift, unsure of what they enjoy or want in life. They are somewhat financially successful but feel unfulfilled and are uncertain about their current job and living situation. They are considering staying with their aging mother to help her but also feel the need to live their own life. Worries about continually rampant inflation are making them precarious about their decision. They are seeking insights and perspective on their situation.**"

I've found that different voices are a really fun way to connect with information you are learning about. For example, I asked ""explain machine learning as Trump""

>Okay, folks, listen closely, I'm going to tell you something tremendous, absolutely tremendous. It's called Machine Learning, and believe me, nobody knows Machine Learning better than me.

>What happens is, you've got these smart computers, okay? Very smart. They learn. They learn just like you and me. Probably better than Sleepy Joe, let me tell you. They're given lots of information, big data, we're talking huge amounts of data.

>We have two types here, well three, actually. First one is supervised learning. This is like baby steps, folks. You give the computer a problem and the answer. The computer learns from that, it's great. Very simple. It's like when I ran my business, I tell people what to do, and they do it. Super efficient.

>Then there's unsupervised learning, which is, frankly, very exciting. You give the computer data, but no answers. The computer has to figure it out itself. It's like exploring, folks. Like Columbus discovering America.

>And then we have reinforcement learning. This is the real deal, folks. The computer tries different things, sees what works, what doesn’t. It’s like negotiating a great deal, you have to figure out what works. If it messes up, it learns. It tries again, and it gets better.

>So, you see, Machine Learning is making computers great again. We're talking top-notch technology. It's going to be huge, folks, absolutely huge. We're winning with Machine Learning, and we will keep winning.

I'd love to know some other voices that you have tried that worked well, especially people that my 18 year old students might relate to or think are funny."
14gainy,5,2023-06-22,Is this program and degree worth it in the current environment?,u/BKong64,OSUOnlineCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OSUOnlineCS/comments/14gainy/is_this_program_and_degree_worth_it_in_the/,"Hey all,

I am a 31 year old looking to make a career change compared to what I have been doing the past 8 years since graduating with my Bachelors in Psychology. I have ALWAYS enjoyed Tech whether it be computers, video games, cell phones etc. etc. I decided to look more into Computer Science and programming as a  result, and at first I read about what seemed to be a plethora of opportunity in this field with high paying jobs, career progression and so forth. It almost seemed too good to be true. And now....I kind of feel like it is? Once I read about the advancements of stuff like ChatGPT paired with the incredibly tough market for entry level CS related work right now, my mindset began to change. Prior to this mindset change, I was dead set on getting into this program (I'm currently doing the math pre-req and was planning on finishing it soon and applying for the Fall semester), but now I'm questioning this decision much much more. To be clear, I'm not necessarily interested in this field because of some of the insane salaries, but because I thought it seemed to be a relatively stable field with good job security that could afford a comfortable living. Which, to me, is between 75-90k a year, anything over that is gravy to me coming from what I did at 60k. I also enjoy being a student and constantly learning, but I also value stability and peace of mind when it comes to my career.

Sadly I feel like all I've been reading about is how insanely difficult it is to break into this field right now unless you have already been in it for years with tons of experience. People are applying to literally well over 1,000+ positions with minimal call backs or interviews, going through long interview processes only to be rejected and then back on the hamster wheel. And then the main reason to me to go for a degree in this, internships, it seems like that has become almost equally as competitive and difficult? So what do you do if you get through your whole degree and didn't manage to land an internship? Sure, you still have the degree which is better than no degree, but you also come out with no experience other than the degree in an insanely competitive market. This is all without mentioning that some people are expecting the field to shrink a decent amount or salaries to be cut quite a bit because of the advent of AI making it so companies need less devs and so on (in turn, making things more competitive). The other career I'm considering is social work, which is a more natural progression of my bachelors degree, and yes the pay is definitely lower than CS but my state (NY) is also very social work friendly and desperately needs males, so I know finding stable and decent paying work wouldn't be tough. But I also know I'm capable of doing something like CS, and I don't want to sell myself short of getting a degree that could still potentially be very worth it. 

I don't mean to be doom and gloom here, and I could have just posted this over at CS career questions or whatever, but I wanted to post here and hear from both (preferably recent) graduates of this program and students going through it now. Do you guys/gals feel that the program is/has been worth it given the recent downturn? Do you feel confident that you will land a job and a stable career still (or have you during these turbulent times)? Am I crazy for worrying about this stuff before jumping in?"

I'm interested in learning about basic concepts of Ayurveda in teacher student format where i can argue with the chatbot and it doesn't lie to me. How should i go about it? Similarly i'm interested in arguing about Hindu philosophy, for my own learning. So i'm seeking a truthful & logical chatbot."

The reliance on an AI chatbot to complete homework undermines academic integrity by bypassing critical thinking, problem-solving, and independent learning, which are essential for students' educational growth. It also raises concerns of plagiarism, as students may present work generated by ChatGPT as their own."" - ChatGPT

  
So I asked ChatGPT to write an essay about the ethics of students using the bot for homework. After that I posed the following question: ""How do you suggest we should address these ethical issues?"". The above text is the answer to this follow up question.

I'm a concerned educator that loves technology and want to help other teachers to see AI as a tool more than as a threat. Does anyone has practical advice on this matter?

**In a recent interview with Fox Business, Julia Dixon,** the founder of **ES.Ai,** an Ai tool for college applications, emphasized the importance of students incorporating artificial intelligence into their educational journey.

She argued that students who don't leverage AI resources will find themselves at a disadvantage, as AI in education is as inevitable as the internet or a search engine.

Dixon, a former tutor, compared the use of AI in brainstorming ideas, outlining essays, and editing students' work to the role of a human tutor. She stressed that Ai should not replace students' work but assist them, and it's not cheating as long as ethical tools and practices are followed.

Dixon hopes that Ai tools like **ES.Ai** will increase students' access to tutoring and educational resources.

She warned that ***students need to learn how to make AI ""work for them""*** so it doesn't become ""a replacement for them."" She reiterated that students who aren't learning how to use AI properly will be at a disadvantage.

In a related development, New York City Public Schools had initially banned the use of ChatGPT, a generative AI chatbot, in classrooms, but later reversed the decision

Ending: Alaric, Dorian, and the twins return to the school, Ric and Josie decide to let the club continue, but he will be monitoring them close. Lizzie said that she once asked about  the Gemini Coven and their history, but he didn't reply. Ric said that he would talk to them about the Gemini when Caroline visits.  Hope, Landon,  and Rafael are told about the knife, and Landon decides he wants to find his biological parents. Dorian and Emma talk about the events of the day, and the last scene is the killer ( Triad Agent Burr) calling his boss, who is the head of Triad, and said they have a spy on the inside of the school."
14hg9d7,0,2023-06-23,Anyone teach composition in a foreign language?,u/Routine-Product-333,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/14hg9d7/anyone_teach_composition_in_a_foreign_language/,"So I teach composition in English to non-native students as part of the language courses. The main objectives are to teach them the basic composition in English (structure of a paragraph etc.) and to make them improve their English ability in general (grammar, vocabulary, how to use a dictionary etc.). 

If any of you teach similar courses, I’d love to know how you are dealing with DeepL and ChatGPT. I let them use Grammarly, but it’s hard to incorporate DeepL or ChatGPT in a way that has pedagogical value. As soon as I allow them to use them in class, I’m sure they’ll just copy and paste everything and learn nothing. But then, it is almost impossible to ban them or prove it when there’s a suspicion. It’s getting more and more stressful for me to teach the course, constantly worrying someone might be cheating but being unable to hold them accountable for it. Thoughts?"
14htbq7,109,2023-06-24,List of unfriendly subreddits for SWs,u/thaburner69000,CreatorsAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreatorsAdvice/comments/14htbq7/list_of_unfriendly_subreddits_for_sws/,"Yesterday I made a post about a subreddit unrelated to SW that bans all SWs who post on it, they're far from the only one so I thought it may be helpful 5o compile a list of subs for us to avoid. My assumption is that every ban gets out accounts flagged by Reddit in some way so my thought is better safe than sorry. There were honestly a lot that really surprised me on here and I'm very disappointed about the amount of LGBTQIA specific subs here considering as a community we end up being SWs more than any other. While this is a long list it's definitely not an extensive one so if there are any that I missed (chatgpt was a big part of helping me make this but isn't always the most accurate or complete) please feel free to leave them in the comments! This is definitely disheartening but I hope you find it helpful 🙂

 make a little summary about the ninewells molecular division, ruled by professor james chalmers ChatGPT4

As of my last knowledge update in September 2021, I do not have information on a ""Ninewells Molecular Division"" headed by Professor James Chalmers. Professor James Chalmers is a prominent researcher known for his work in respiratory medicine, particularly in bronchiectasis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, it is possible that the Ninewells Molecular Division is a new development or initiative that has emerged since my knowledge was last updated. Ninewells Hospital is a large teaching hospital based in Dundee, Scotland, and is affiliated with the University of Dundee. It is known for its research and medical education programs. I recommend checking the latest sources or the official website of Ninewells Hospital or the University of Dundee for the most recent information on the Ninewells Molecular Division and Professor James Chalmers' involvement.

Mainly because I had my time dedicated to something else, which left me with not enough time to answer other people's questions and participate in this specific community. However, I've learned a lot from some other events at Foothill or off campus, which are very interesting, and there is some stuff I would like to share.

For the Business Innovation Challenge, I was developing an app using LLM (Large Language Model) and a vector database storage for similarity search.

So basically, for part of the functionality, I created a chatbot using Langchain, the OpenAI API, and a vector database to store text embeddings, which record the semantic meaning of the embedded text.

I believe most CS students have played with ChatGPT lately and have seen its powerfulness. However, I've learned from digging into the technology for months that LLM (such as ChatGPT) is not only a chatbot. We can basically treat it as an engine or a brain to process some logic that would otherwise be very hard to do with our traditional algorithms. For example, the app I built during the Business Innovation Challenge was a recipe generation app where I first stored some user preferences information in the database and later on extracted that info and injected them into an LLM prompt asking it to produce some recipes. Without the power of large language models, this would have required a very complicated design in which we might store a lot of recipe information in our database and perform a complex algorithm to pick and generate the right one for a particular user.

Yet, there's still a problem with these LLMs: they don't have memory, and there are limitations for the prompt text size, whether it's 4096 tokens or 8000-something. So, that's when the vector databases come into play. We can preprocess and store information in a vector database, along with the original text data as metadata. So, for example, if I were to ask my chatbot to look for certain context in a very large PDF of hundreds and thousands of pages, I could write a parser to split the pdf texts into chunks and then store the pieces as vector embeddings. Later on, when a user is trying to ask a question or when our own controller is trying to generate something off of the LLM, we can first convert our original prompt into a vector (using OpenAI embedding or other similar tools) and perform a cosine similarity search on the database to look for the top k relevant chunks, then inject them into our LLM prompt as a reference.

I found this technique super powerful; we have infinite opportunities to build different inspiring apps and programs.

Here's a diagram of the model mentioned above.

After the Business Innovation Challenge, our team had a chance to be invited to a Venture Capital Funds to do a presentation. I attended a private pitching event where several genuine startup companies were seeking to secure funding from potential investors, including seed rounds. Regardless, I want to also share some of the stuff I learned from these pitches from other presenters that I could have done. So the structure of the pitch mainly consists of a problem statement, introducing the solutions, features, market analysis, market break-in strategy, and financials. I found most startups there talked about the TAM/SAM/SOM, which I didn't. Another strategy that I learned was to leave some information that is crucial but not necessarily relevant to the main storyline as an appendix. For instance, financial reports, projections, or market competitor questions are commonly asked. Instead of trying to squeeze all the information in the main pitch, it can be very helpful to just don't include it and put them on the slides that we are not presenting. When the judges or investors ask questions related to those topics, we can quickly move to those pages and answer with some evidence to increase credibility.

&#x200B;

So, these are the stuff that I learned from the business innovation challenge, which I'd like to share with our fellow classmates and the community. There is also some other stuff I'd like to share from another very interesting event: AI CalHacks.I'll see you in the next post. Peace!

14i0jsf,1,2023-06-24,Should students be allowed to wear elf ears in school?,u/ThanosandHobbes,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/14i0jsf/should_students_be_allowed_to_wear_elf_ears_in/,"I work as a teacher in a special needs school in the uk. A pupil with identity confusion wore elf ears in the playground, confusing and drawing attention from other pupils who didn’t understand. I could see that the boy was beginning to feel intimidated by a few approaching boys. I called him over and asked what he was wearing and why he had them in school. I explained that the ears were not school uniform and told him to remove them and put them back to class. He understood and obliged. 

Later that afternoon I was accused by a teaching assistant of victim blaming and that the boy should be able to wear whatever he wants without feeling threatened. I  responded explaining that we are responsible for all the pupils in school. That they are all vulnerable and have their own needs. Supporting their playtimes are hard enough. We don’t need water guns, Polaroid cameras and now elf ears (things this pupil has brought into school in the past) in school unless the teachers and parents have agreed.  

The teaching assistant replied “ideally everyone gets to wear whatever they want without feeling threatened”. I replied, “yes, ideally, I agree.”

He walked off looking upset. I’m not sure why. Later on the deputy head calls me in and said that the assistant spoke to another teacher who then accused me of  victim blaming, explaining that elf ears are part of the lgbt community. 

I thought the student was lucky that I was there to preemptively defuse an escalating situation. But  the accusations have left me doubting my actions and considering how to protect myself from future accusation. If it were to happen again, I might put my own interests before the student’s

I just searched online and asked ChatGPT. Generally elf ears are an accessory that have nothing to do with gender or sexuality."

We build explain tuned WizardLM dataset \~70K, Alpaca dataset \~52K & Dolly-V2 dataset \~15K created using approaches from Orca Research Paper.

&#x200B;

We leverage all of the 15 system instructions provided in Orca Research Paper. to generate custom datasets, in contrast to vanilla instruction tuning approaches used by original datasets.

&#x200B;

This helps student model aka this model to learn thought process from teacher model, which is ChatGPT (gpt-3.5-turbo-0301 version).

14ilfju,1,2023-06-25,Foundry Revival Project - Starfleet Security Files (SSF) in visual novel form! Plus contest.,u/Gorgonops_SSF,stofoundry,https://www.reddit.com/r/stofoundry/comments/14ilfju/foundry_revival_project_starfleet_security_files/,"Greetings!

I (senior Foundry author and Foundry Roundtable co-host who did things like Gemini, Trident, and Apex) embarked on a crazy scheme this summer and have learned the Ren'Py visual novel engine.  It's a free python-based tool for creating visual novels (ex. dating sims) that I'll be doing some tutorials for (re. how to make Foundry missions with it) when I have the time.  But for now, here's my first mission with it!

https://preview.redd.it/cxxfpafpu58b1.jpg?width=1097&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=032d81ff123319c546975f056463dab90d92adf6

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1L7fzy4jWWdyML5F4oD3j9f\_ZIHZd\_uC7?usp=drive\_link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1L7fzy4jWWdyML5F4oD3j9f_ZIHZd_uC7?usp=drive_link)

Gemini is the first mission in my old Starfleet security series dealing with the case of a duplicate head of a small world named Iffar.  You proceed with a plucky starfleet security team to investigate the incident, learn about a new people, and do your best not to blow up too many things.

Link to old mission's thread on STO forums: [Star Trek Online | Arc Games](https://account.arcgames.com/en/forums/startrekonline/#/discussion/1204730/the-starfleet-security-files-ssf/p1)

I've uploaded the game's zip to the above google drive.  To play, all you need to do is download, unzip, then run the Gemini application file.  The game is a dialog-driven adventure with character and location art pulled from STO and my Foundry missions.  For the limitations in not having things like 3D environments or the STO engine, there's a lot of fun to be had here with much more flexible dialog trees, story branching, and the ability to program in new RPG elements.  It can very efficiently tell the same stories we used to make for STO, has a similar dynamic with STO providing an accessible point to make visual novels with, and doesn't rely on any live service to run beyond STO continuing to exist for more screenshots.

So, enjoy!  The mission is about 1/2 hour to an hour in length though unlike the foundry includes save/load function so you can drop in/out however you please.  I'm making more of these missions and hope to get other Foundry authors inspired to do this as well (learning Ren'Py isn't any more daunting than learning the Foundry editor).  So, we're kind of back in business, community willing.

To kick things off, I'm also hosting a contest!  Gemini features four dialog stats:

1. Clues (for investigating the mystery of the episode)
2. Student of Iffar (for inquiring about the planet/people involved)
3. Friend of Cetsa (for being a friend to the central character)
4. Rebel (for being brash/stupid)

You can track your stats through a few dialog prompts that pop up during the mission.  Post a screenshot/summary of your final mission stats before July 8th and the folks with the highest stats in each category will each receive a lock box key (limit one per person to spread the love, and you don't have to declare a single category for entry).

If you have any questions or problems with the mission let me know, feedback is certainly appreciated.  So too is spreading the word and letting the STO community know we've got silly little fan-made stories set in the STO universe to play again.  Every gesture helps rebuild something of what we had (and it's not something I can do all on my own).

Thanks,

14iprii,3,2023-06-25,Vacation Bible School: Imperium of Man Edition,u/Glittering_Fish7061,40k,https://www.reddit.com/r/40k/comments/14iprii/vacation_bible_school_imperium_of_man_edition/,"Give me the curriculum for vacation bible school in the Imperium of man 40k universe 

ChatGPT

Vacation Bible School (VBS) in the Warhammer 40K universe, specifically within the context of the Imperium of Man, would be a unique and quite dystopian experience compared to traditional Vacation Bible Schools. Instead of learning about traditional Christian stories and teachings, students would be taught about the Emperor of Mankind, the Imperial Creed, and the dangers of Chaos.

Here's a potential curriculum:

Day 1: Introduction to the Emperor

The Emperor's Rise: Discuss the Emperor's rise to power during the Unification Wars on Terra.

The Emperor as Mankind's Protector: Discuss the Emperor's role as the guardian and guiding light of humanity, protecting them from the dangers of Chaos and xenos threats.

Crafts: Students could make art that symbolizes the Emperor's guiding light.

Day 2: Understanding the Imperial Creed

The Basic Teachings: An overview of the Imperial Creed, explaining its core tenets and how it guides the lives of the citizens of the Imperium.

The Role of the Ecclesiarchy: Discussion on the importance of the Adeptus Ministorum, their role in disseminating the Imperial Creed, and the lives of its key figures like Saint Celestine.

Crafts: Students could make miniatures of Ecclesiarchy figures or create drawings of iconic symbols like the Imperial Aquila.

Day 3: The Adeptus Astartes and Their Role

Who are the Space Marines: Introduction to the Adeptus Astartes as the Emperor's finest warriors, detailing their creation and role.

Famous Chapters and Heroes: Learn about famous chapters like the Ultramarines, Blood Angels, and their renowned heroes.

Crafts: Students could build and paint Space Marine miniatures.

Day 4: Recognizing the Enemy: Chaos and Xenos Threats

The Forces of Chaos: Teach the students about the danger posed by Chaos, without going into dangerous detail. The focus should be on understanding Chaos as an enemy, not sparking curiosity about its nature.

The Xenos Threat: Discussion about the alien threats to the Imperium like the Orks, Tyranids, and Eldar.

Crafts: Drawings or collages showing the Emperor's forces triumphing over Chaos and Xenos.

Day 5: Living in the Emperor's Light

Daily Life in the Imperium: Teach the children about how their lives and their families' lives are part of the larger structure of the Imperium. This would include a discussion on the role of the Imperial Guard, Adeptus Mechanicus, Rogue Traders, and more.

Dedication and Faith: The importance of faith in the Emperor and dedication to their duty as citizens of the Imperium.

Final Activity: A group prayer to the Emperor, showing the unity of all people under His protection.

Remember that in the grimdark universe of Warhammer 40k, faith in the Emperor and hatred/fear of Chaos and xenos races is paramount. The tone of this VBS would be quite different from a traditional one, focusing much more on obedience, duty, and the constant existential threat that is a part of life in the Imperium."

Additionally, I have published this same article on [medium.com](https://medium.com/@mattoracz/10y-of-product-development-2-bankruptcies-and-1-exit-what-next-8ca7e448382e?source=friends_link&sk=f0a8eb275a267c943d7ceaa0b22b06dc), so if you have an account there, **I'd appreciate your thumbs-up and subscription. Happy reading.**

There are many founders, product creators, and proactive individuals, I’ve read many of your crazy stories and lessons so **I decided to share mine** and the **lessons I learned from the bottom to impressive product-market fit and exit.**

I've spent almost the past **10 years** building **tech products** as a **Corporate Team Leader, Senior Software Developer, Online Course Creator, Programming Tutor, Head of Development/CTO, and 3x Startup Founder (2 bankruptcies, and 1 exit).**

And what next? good question...

A brief summary of my journey:

## Chapter 1: Software Developer / Team Leader / Senior Software Developer

**I’ve always wanted to create products that win over users’ hearts, carry value, and influence users**. Ever since my school days, I’ve **loved the tech part of building digital** products.

At the beginning of school, I started hosting servers for games, blogs and internet forums, and other things that did not require much programming knowledge. **My classmates and later even over 100 people played** on servers that **I hosted on my home PC**.

Later, as the only person in school, I passed the final exam in computer science.

During my **computer science studies**, I **started my first job as a software developer**. It was crazy, I was spending **200–300 hours** a month in the office attending also to daily classes. **Yes, I didn’t have a life**, but **it truly was the fulfillment of my dreams**. I was able to earn good money doing what I love, and **I devoted fully myself to it.**

**My key to effectively studying IT** and growing my knowledge at rocket speed was learning day by day reading guides, building products to the portfolio, watching youtube channels and **attending conferences**, and even watching them online, even if I didn’t understand everything at the beginning. In one year we’ve been to every possible event within 400km.

We were building healthcare products that were actually used in hospitals and medical facilities. It was a beautiful adventure and tons of knowledge I took from this place.

**That time I built my first product teams, hired many great people**, and over the years became a **senior developer** and **team leader**. Even I convinced my study mates to apply to this company and we studied together and worked as well. **Finally, there were 4 of us**, when I left a friend of mine took over my position and still works there. If you’re reading this, I’m sending you a flood of love and appreciation.

I joined as the 8th person, and after around 4 years, when I left hungry for change, there were already over 30 of us, now around 100. It was a good time, greetings to everyone. **I finished my Master’s and Engineering degrees in Computer Science, and it was time for changes**.

## Chapter 2: 1st time as a Co-founder — Marketplace

In the meantime, there was also my first startup (**a marketplace**) with four of my friends. **We all worked on the product**, each of us **spent thousands of hours, after hours**, entire weekends… and I think finally over a year of work.

As you might guess, **we lacked the most important things: sales, marketing, and product-market fit**. We thought users think like us. We all also worked commercially, so the work went very smoothly, **but we didn’t know what we should do next with it…**

Finally, **we didn’t have any customers**, but you know what, I don’t regret it, a lot of learning things which I used many times later. The first attempts at validating the idea with the market and business activities.

**In the end**, the product was **Airbnb-sized**. Landing pages, listings, user panels, customer panels, admin site, notifications, caches, queues, load balancing, and much more. We wanted to publish the fully ready product to the market.

**It was a marketplace, so if you can guess, we had to attract both sides to be valuable.**

**“Marketplace”** — You can imagine **something like Uber**, if you don’t have passengers it was difficult to **convince taxi drivers**, if you don’t have a large number of taxi drivers **you cannot attract passengers**.

**After a year of development**, we were overloaded, and without business, marketing, sales knowledge, and budget.

## Chapter 3: Corp Team Lead / Programming Tutor / Programming Architecture Workshop Leader

Working in a corporation, a totally different environment, an international fintech, another learning experience, large products, and **workmates who were waiting for 5 pm** to finish — it wasn’t for me.

**Very slow product development, huge hierarchy, being an ant at the bottom, and low impact on the final product.**

At that time I understood that being a software developer is not anything special and I compared my work to factory worker. Sorry for that. High rates have been pumped only by **high demand**. Friends of mine from another industry do more difficult things and have a bigger responsibility for lower rates. **That’s how the market works.**

This lower responsibility time allowed for building the first online course after hours, my own course platform, individual teaching newbies programming, and my first huge success — my first B2C customers, and B2B clients for workshops. I pivoted to full focus on sales, marketing, funnels, advertisements, demand, understanding the market, etc.

**It was 10x easier than startups but allowed me to learn and validate my conceptions and ideas on an easier market and showed me that it’s much easier to locate their problem/need/want and create a service/product that responds to it than to convince people of your innovative ideas.**

**It’s just supply and demand**, such a simple and basic statement, in reality, is very deep and **difficult to understand without personal experience. If you’re inexperienced and you think you understand, you don’t.**

To this day, I love to analyze this catchword in relation to various industries / services / products and rediscover it again and again... While writing this sentence, I’m wondering if I’m not **obsessed**.

## Chapter 4: Next try — 2nd time as a founder — Edtech

Drawing upon my experiences in selling services, offering trainings, and teaching programming, I wanted to broaden my horizons, delve into various fields of knowledge, involve more teachers, and so on.

**We started with simple services in different fields of knowledge, mainly relying on teaching in the local area** (without online lessons). As I had already gathered some knowledge and experience in marketing and sales, things were going well and were moving in the right direction.

**The number of teachers in various fields was growing, as was the number of students.** I don’t remember the exact statistics anymore, but it was **another significant achievement** that brought me a lot of **satisfaction and new experiences**.

As you know, **I’m a technology lover** and **couldn’t bear to look at manual processes — I wanted to automate everything**: lessons, payments, invoices, customer service, etc. **That’s when I hired our first developers** (if you’re reading this, I’m sending you a flood of love — we spent a lot of time together and I remember it as a very fruitful and great year) and we began the process of tool and automation development. After a year we had really extended tools for students, teachers, franchise owners, etc.

We had really big goals, we wanted to climb higher and higher. Maybe I wouldn’t even fully call it Startup, as the client was paying for the lessons, not for the software. But it gave us positive income, bootstrap financing, and tool development for services provided.

**Scaling this model was not as costless as SaaS because customer satisfaction was mainly on the side of the teacher, not the quality of the product (software). Finally, we grew to nearly 10 people and dozens of teachers, with zero external funding, and almost $50k monthly revenue.**

We worked very hard, day and night, and by November 2019, we were packed with clients to the brim. And as you know, **that’s when the pandemic hit**. It turned everything upside down by 180 degrees. Probably no one was ready for it. With a drastic drop in revenues, society started to save. Tired from the previous months, we had to work even harder.

We had to reduce the team, change the model, and save what we had built. We stopped the tool’s development and sales, and **with the developers, we started supporting other product teams to not fire them in difficult times.**

**The tool worked passively for the next two years**, reducing incomes month by month. With a smaller team providing programming services, we had full stability and earned more than relying only on educational services. At the peak of the pandemic, **I promised myself that it was the last digital product I built… Never say never…**

## Chapter 5: Time for fintech — Senior Software Developer / Team Lead / Head of Development

I worked for small startups and companies. Building **products from scratch**, having a significant **impact on the product**, and complete fulfillment. Thousands of hours and **sacrifices**.

**This article mainly talks about startups that I built, so I don’t want to list all the companies, products, and applications that I supported as a technology consultant.** These were mainly start-ups with a couple of people up to around 100 people on board.

**Some of the products were just a rescue mission**, others were building an entire tech team. **I was fully involved in all of them with the hope that we would work together for a long time**, but I wasn’t the only one who made mistakes when looking for a product-market fit.

One thing I fully understood: **You can’t spend 8–15 hours a day writing code, managing a tech team, and still be able to help build an audience.**

**In marketing and sales**, you need to **be rested and very creative to bring results and achieve further results and goals**. If you have too many responsibilities related to technology, it becomes ineffective.

**I noticed that when I have more free time, more time to think, and more time to bounce the ball against the wall, I come up with really working marketing/sales strategies and solutions. It’s impossible when you are focused on code all day.**

**You must know that this chapter of my life was long and has continued until now.**

## Chapter 6: 3rd time as a founder — sold

Never say never… right?\*\*

It was a time when the crypto market was **really high** and it was really **trending topic**. You know that I love technology right? So I cannot miss the **blockchain world**. I had experience in blockchain topics by learning on my own and from startups where I worked before.

**I was involved in crypto communities and I noticed** a “starving crowd”. People who did things manually and earned money(crypto) on it.I found potential for building a small product that solves a technological problem.

I said a few years before **that I don’t want to start from scratch**. I decided to share my observations and possibilities with my good friend. **He said, “If you gonna built it, I’m in”.**

**I couldn’t stop thinking about it. I had thought and planned every aspect of marketing and sales. And you know what. On this huge mindmap “product” was only one block. 90% of the mindmap was focused on marketing and sales.**

Now, writing this article, **I understood what path I went from my first startup to this one**. In the first (described earlier) **90% was the product, but in the last one 90% was sales and marketing**. Many years later, I did this approach automatically. **What has changed in my head over the years and so many mistakes?**

**At that time, the company for which I provided services was acquired**. The next day I got a thank you for my hard work and **all my accounts were blocked**.

Life… **I was shocked**. We were simply replaced by their trusted technology managers. **They wanted to get full control**. They acted a bit unkindly, but I knew that they had all my knowledge about the product in the documentation, because I’m used to drawing everything so that in the moment of my weakness (illness, whatever) the team could handle it.

**That’s what solid leaders do, right?** After a time, I know that these are normal procedures in financial companies, the point is that **under the influence of emotions, do not do anything inappropriate.**

**I quickly forgot about it, that I was brutally fired. All that mattered was to bring my plan to life.**

**And it has been started, 15–20 hours a day every day. You have to believe me, getting back into the game was incredibly satisfying for me.** I didn’t even know that I would be so excited.

**Then we also noticed that someone was starting to think about the same product as me. So the race began a game against time and the market.**

I assume that if you **have reached this point**, you are **interested in product-market fit, marketing, and sales**, so let me explain **my assumptions to you**:

## Product:

A very very small tool that allowed you to automate proper tracking and creation of on-chain transactions. **Literally, the whole app for the user was located on only three subpages.**

## Starving Crowd:

**We tapped into an underserved market**. The crypto market primarily operates via communities on platforms like Discord, Reddit, Twitter, Telegram, and so on. **Therefore, our main strategy was directly communicating with users and demonstrating our tool**. This was essentially “free marketing” (excluding the time we invested), **as we did not need to invest in ads, promotional materials, or convince people about the efficacy of our tool.**

**The community could directly observe on-chain transactions executed by our algorithms, which were processed at an exceptionally fast rate.** This was something they couldn’t accomplish manually, so whenever someone conducted transactions using our algorithm, it was immediately noticeable and stirred a curiosity within the community **(how did they do that!)**.

## Tests:

I conducted the initial tests of the application on myself — we had already invested significantly in developing the product, **but I preferred risking my own resources over that of the users.** I provided the tool access to my wallet, containing 0.3ETH, and went to sleep. Upon waking up, I discovered that the transactions were successful and my wallet had grown to 0.99ETH. **My excitement knew no bounds, it felt like a windfall. But, of course, there was a fair chance I could have lost it too.**

**It worked**. As we progressed, some users achieved higher results, but it largely hinged on the parameters set by them. As you can surmise, the strategy was simple — **buy low, sell high**. There was considerable risk involved.

## Churn:

For those versed in marketing, the significance of repeat visitors cannot be overstated. Access to our tool was granted only after email verification and a special technique that I’d prefer to keep confidential. And this was all provided for free. While we had zero followers on social media, we saw an explosion in our email subscriber base and amassed a substantial number of users and advocates.

## Revenue Generation:

Our product quickly gained popularity as we were effectively helping users earn — an undeniable value proposition. Now, it was time to capitalize on our efforts. We introduced a subscription model charging $300 per week or $1,000 per month — seemingly high rates, but the demand was so intense that it wasn’t an issue. Being a subscriber meant you were prioritized in the queue, ensuring you were among the first to reap benefits — thus adding more “value”.

## Marketing:

**The quality of our product and its ability to continually engage users contributed to it achieving what can best be described as viral.**

It was both a source of pride and astonishment to witness **users sharing charts and analyses derived from our tool in forum discussions**. They weren’t actively promoting our product but rather using **screenshots from our application to illustrate certain aspects of the crypto world**.

By that stage, we had already assembled a team to assist with marketing, and programming, and to provide round-the-clock helpdesk support.

## Unforgettable Time:

Despite the hype, my focus remained **steadfast on monitoring our servers, their capacity, and speed. Considering we had only been on the market for a few weeks, we were yet to implement alerts, server scaling, etc.**

Our active user base spanned from **Japan** to the **West Coast of the United States**. Primarily, our application was used daily **during the evenings**, but considering the variety of time zones, the only time I could afford to sleep was during the evening hours in Far Eastern Europe, where we had the least users. **However, someone always needed to be on guard, and as such, my phone was constantly by my side. After all, we couldn’t afford to let our users down.**

We found ourselves working **20 hours a day**, catering to thousands of users, enduring physical fatigue, engaging in talks with **VCs**, and **participating in conferences.**

## Sudden Downturn:

**Our pinnacle was abruptly interrupted by the war in Ukraine (next macroeconomic shot straight in the face, lucky guy)**, a precipitous drop in cryptocurrency value, and **swiftly emerging competition**.

**By this time, there were 5–8 comparable tools** had infiltrated the market. It was a challenging period as we continually stumbled upon new rivals.

They immediately **embarked on swift fundraising endeavors — a strategy we overlooked, which in retrospect was a mistake.**

**Although our product was superior, the competitors’ rapid advancement and our insufficient funds for expeditious scaling posed significant challenges.**

**Nonetheless, we made a good decision. We sold the product (exit) to competitors. The revenue from “exit” compensated for all the losses, leaving us with enough rest.**

**We were a small team without substantial budgets for rapid development, and the risk of forming new teams without money to survive for more than 1–2 months was irresponsible.**

**You have to believe me that this decision consumed us sleepless nights.**

**Finally, we sold it. They turned off our app but took algorithms and users.**

Whether you believe it or not, **after several months of toiling day and night, experiencing burnout**, growing weary of the topic, and gaining an extra 15 kg in weight, **we finally found our freedom…**

**The exit wasn’t incredibly profitable**, but we knew they had outdone us. The exit covered all our **expenses and granted us a well-deserved rest for the subsequent quarter.**

**It was an insane ride**. Despite the uncertainty, stress, struggles, and sleepless nights, **the story and experience will remain etched in my memory for the rest of my life**.

## Swift Takeaways:

* Comprehending User Needs: Do you fully understand the **product-market fi**t? Is your offering just an accessory or does it truly satisfy the user’s needs?
* **The Power of Viral Marketing: Take inspiration from giants like Snapchat, ChatGPT, and Clubhouse**. While your product might not attain the same scale (**but remember, never say never…**), the closer your concept is to theirs, the easier your journey will be. **If your user is motivated to text a friend saying, “Hey, check out how cool this is” (like sharing ChatGPT), then you’re on the best track. Really.** Even if it doesn’t seem immediately evident, there could be a way to incorporate this into your product. Keep looking until you find it.
* **Niche targeting** — the more specific and tailored your product is to a certain audience, the easier your journey will be
* **People love buying from people** — establishing a personal brand and associating yourself with the product can make things easier.
* **Value: Seek to understand why users engage with your product and keep returning.**
* **The more specific and critical the issue you’re aiming to solve, the easier your path will be.** Consider your offerings in terms of products and services and focus on sales and marketing, regardless of personal sentiments.

These are just a few points, I plan to elaborate on all of them in a separate article.

Many products undergo years of development in search of market fit, refining the user experience, and more. **And guess what?** There’s absolutely nothing wrong with that.

**Each product and market follows its own rules. Many startups have extensive histories before they finally make their mark (for instance, OpenAI).**

This entire journey spanned maybe 6–8 months. I grasped and capitalized on the opportunity, but we understood from the start that establishing a startup carried a significant risk, and our crypto product was 10 times riskier.

**Was it worth it? Given my passion for product development — absolutely.**

**Was it profitable? — No, considering the hours spent — we lose.**

**Did it provide a stable, problem-free life — nope.**

**Did this entire adventure offer a wealth of happiness, joy, and unforgettable experiences — definitely yes.**

**One thing is certain — we’ve amassed substantial experience and it’s not over yet :)**

**So, what lies ahead?**

**Chapter 7: Reverting to the contractor, developing a product for a crypto Startup**Returning to the past, we continue our journey…

I had invested substantial time and passion into the tech rescue mission product. I came on board as the technical Team Leader of a startup that had garnered over $20M in seed round funding, affiliated with the realm of cryptocurrencies. The investors were individuals with extensive backgrounds in the crypto world.

**My role was primarily technical, and there was an abundance of work to tackle. I was fully immersed, and genuinely devoted to the role.** I was striving for excellence, knowing that if we secured another round of financing, **the startup would accelerate rapidly.**

**As for the product and marketing, I was more of an observer**.

After all, there were marketing professionals with decades of experience on board. These were individuals recruited from large crypto-related firms. I had faith in them, kept an eye on their actions, and focused on my own responsibilities. **However, the reality was far from satisfactory.**

**On the last day, the principal investor for the Series A round withdrew. The board made the tough decision to shut down. It was a period of intense observation and gaining experience in product management.**

**This was a very brief summary of the last 10 years.**

**And what next?**

## (Last) Chapter 8: To be announced — Product Owner / Product Consultant / Strategist / CTO

After spending countless hours and days deliberating my next steps, one thing is clear:

**My aspiration is to continue traversing the path of software product development, with the hopeful anticipation that one day, I might ride the crest of the next big wave and ascend to the prestigious status of a unicorn company.**

I find myself drawn to the process of building products, exploring product-market fit, strategizing, engaging in software development, seeking out new opportunities, networking, attending conferences, and continuously challenging myself by understanding the market and its competitive landscape.

## Product Owner / Product Consultant / CTO / COO:

I’m not entirely sure how to categorize this role, as I anticipate that it will largely depend on the product to which I will commit myself fully.

**My idea is to find one startup/company that wants to build a product / or already has a product, want to speed up, or simply doesn’t know what’s next.**

Alternatively, I could be a part of an established company with a rich business history, which intends to invest in digitization and technological advancements. The goal would be to enrich their customer experience by offering complementary digital products

**Rather than initiating a new venture from ground zero with the same team, I am receptive to new challenges.** I am confident that my past experiences will prove highly beneficial for the **founders of promising, burgeoning startups that already possess a product, or are in the initial phases of development.**

**‘Consultant’** — I reckon we interpret this term differently. My aim is to be completely absorbed in a single product, crafting funnels, niches, strategies, and all that is necessary to repeatedly achieve the ‘product-market fit’ and significant revenue. **To me, ‘consultant’ resonates more akin to freelancing than being an employee**.

**My current goal is to kickstart as a consultant and aide, dealing with facilitating startups in their journey from point A to B.**

**Here are two theoretical scenarios to illustrate my approach:** **Scenario 1:**

1. (**Starting from point A**) You have a product but struggle with marketing, adoption, software, strategy, sales, fundraising, or something else.
2. I conduct an analysis and develop a strategy to reach point B.
3. I take on the **“dirty work”** and **implement** necessary changes, including potential pivots or shifts (going all-in) to guide the product to point B.
4. **The goal is to reach point B, which could involve achieving a higher valuation, expanding the user base, increasing sales, or generating monthly revenue, among other metrics.**

**Scenario 2:**

1. (**Starting from point A**) You have a plan or idea but face challenges with marketing, adoption, strategy, software, sales, fundraising, or something else.
2. I analyze the situation and devise a strategy to reach **point B**.
3. I tackle the necessary tasks, build the team, and overcome obstacles to propel the product to **point B**.

I have come across the view that finding the elusive product-market fit is the job of the founder, and it’s hard for me to disagree.

However, I believe that my support and experiences can help save money, many failures, and most importantly, time. I have spent a great deal of time learning from my mistakes, enduring failure after failure, and even had no one to ask for support or opinion, which is why I offer my help. Saving even a couple of years, realistically speaking, seems like a value I’m eager to provide…

**I invite you to share your thoughts and insights on these scenarios :)**

## Closing Remarks:

**I appreciate your time and effort in reaching this point.** This has been my journey, and I wouldn’t change it for the world. I had an extraordinary adventure, and now **I’m ready for the next exciting battle with the market and new software products.**

While my entire narrative is centered around startups, especially the ones I personally built, I’m planning to share more insights drawn from all of my experiences, not just those as a co-founder.

**If you’re currently developing your product or even just considering the idea, I urge you to reach out to me. Perhaps together, we can create something monumental :)**

**Thank you for your time and insights. I eagerly look forward to engaging in discussions and hearing your viewpoints. Please remember to like and subscribe. Nothing motivates to write more than positive feedback :)**

And what next? good question...

A brief summary of my journey:

## Chapter 1: Software Developer / Team Leader / Senior Software Developer

**I’ve always wanted to create products that win over users’ hearts, carry value, and influence users**. Ever since my school days, I’ve **loved the tech part of building digital** products.

At the beginning of school, I started hosting servers for games, blogs and internet forums, and other things that did not require much programming knowledge. **My classmates and later even over 100 people played** on servers that **I hosted on my home PC**.

Later, as the only person in school, I passed the final exam in computer science.

During my **computer science studies**, I **started my first job as a software developer**. It was crazy, I was spending **200–300 hours** a month in the office attending also to daily classes. **Yes, I didn’t have a life**, but **it truly was the fulfillment of my dreams**. I was able to earn good money doing what I love, and **I devoted fully myself to it.**

**My key to effectively studying IT** and growing my knowledge at rocket speed was learning day by day reading guides, building products to the portfolio, watching youtube channels and **attending conferences**, and even watching them online, even if I didn’t understand everything at the beginning. In one year we’ve been to every possible event within 400km.

We were building healthcare products that were actually used in hospitals and medical facilities. It was a beautiful adventure and tons of knowledge I took from this place.

**That time I built my first product teams, hired many great people**, and over the years became a **senior developer** and **team leader**. Even I convinced my study mates to apply to this company and we studied together and worked as well. **Finally, there were 4 of us**, when I left a friend of mine took over my position and still works there. If you’re reading this, I’m sending you a flood of love and appreciation.

I joined as the 8th person, and after around 4 years, when I left hungry for change, there were already over 30 of us, now around 100. It was a good time, greetings to everyone. **I finished my Master’s and Engineering degrees in Computer Science, and it was time for changes**.

## Chapter 2: 1st time as a Co-founder — Marketplace

In the meantime, there was also my first startup (**a marketplace**) with four of my friends. **We all worked on the product**, each of us **spent thousands of hours, after hours**, entire weekends… and I think finally over a year of work.

As you might guess, **we lacked the most important things: sales, marketing, and product-market fit**. We thought users think like us. We all also worked commercially, so the work went very smoothly, **but we didn’t know what we should do next with it…**

Finally, **we didn’t have any customers**, but you know what, I don’t regret it, a lot of learning things which I used many times later. The first attempts at validating the idea with the market and business activities.

**In the end**, the product was **Airbnb-sized**. Landing pages, listings, user panels, customer panels, admin site, notifications, caches, queues, load balancing, and much more. We wanted to publish the fully ready product to the market.

**It was a marketplace, so if you can guess, we had to attract both sides to be valuable.**

**“Marketplace”** — You can imagine **something like Uber**, if you don’t have passengers it was difficult to **convince taxi drivers**, if you don’t have a large number of taxi drivers **you cannot attract passengers**.

**After a year of development**, we were overloaded, and without business, marketing, sales knowledge, and budget.

## Chapter 3: Corp Team Lead / Programming Tutor / Programming Architecture Workshop Leader

Working in a corporation, a totally different environment, an international fintech, another learning experience, large products, and **workmates who were waiting for 5 pm** to finish — it wasn’t for me.

**Very slow product development, huge hierarchy, being an ant at the bottom, and low impact on the final product.**

At that time I understood that being a software developer is not anything special and I compared my work to factory worker. Sorry for that. High rates have been pumped only by **high demand**. Friends of mine from another industry do more difficult things and have a bigger responsibility for lower rates. **That’s how the market works.**

This lower responsibility time allowed for building the first online course after hours, my own course platform, individual teaching newbies programming, and my first huge success — my first B2C customers, and B2B clients for workshops. I pivoted to full focus on sales, marketing, funnels, advertisements, demand, understanding the market, etc.

**It was 10x easier than startups but allowed me to learn and validate my conceptions and ideas on an easier market and showed me that it’s much easier to locate their problem/need/want and create a service/product that responds to it than to convince people of your innovative ideas.**

**It’s just supply and demand**, such a simple and basic statement, in reality, is very deep and **difficult to understand without personal experience. If you’re inexperienced and you think you understand, you don’t.**

To this day, I love to analyze this catchword in relation to various industries / services / products and rediscover it again and again... While writing this sentence, I’m wondering if I’m not **obsessed**.

## Chapter 4: Next try — 2nd time as a founder — Edtech

Drawing upon my experiences in selling services, offering trainings, and teaching programming, I wanted to broaden my horizons, delve into various fields of knowledge, involve more teachers, and so on.

We had really big goals, we wanted to climb higher and higher. Maybe I wouldn’t even fully call it Startup, as the client was paying for the lessons, not for the software. But it gave us positive income, bootstrap financing, and tool development for services provided.

**Scaling this model was not as costless as SaaS because customer satisfaction was mainly on the side of the teacher, not the quality of the product (software). Finally, we grew to nearly 10 people and dozens of teachers, with zero external funding, and almost $50k monthly revenue.**

**You must know that this chapter of my life was long and has continued until now.**

## **Chapter 6: 3rd time as a founder — sold

Never say never… right?\*\*

It was a time when the crypto market was **really high** and it was really **trending topic**. You know that I love technology right? So I cannot miss the **blockchain world**. I had experience in blockchain topics by learning on my own and from startups where I worked before.

**I was involved in crypto communities and I noticed** a “starving crowd”. People who did things manually and earned money(crypto) on it.I found potential for building a small product that solves a technological problem.

I said a few years before **that I don’t want to start from scratch**. I decided to share my observations and possibilities with my good friend. **He said, “If you gonna built it, I’m in”.**

**I couldn’t stop thinking about it. I had thought and planned every aspect of marketing and sales. And you know what. On this huge mindmap “product” was only one block. 90% of the mindmap was focused on marketing and sales.**

Now, writing this article, **I understood what path I went from my first startup to this one**. In the first (described earlier) **90% was the product, but in the last one 90% was sales and marketing**. Many years later, I did this approach automatically. **What has changed in my head over the years and so many mistakes?**

**At that time, the company for which I provided services was acquired**. The next day I got a thank you for my hard work and **all my accounts were blocked**.

Life… **I was shocked**. We were simply replaced by their trusted technology managers. **They wanted to get full control**. They acted a bit unkindly, but I knew that they had all my knowledge about the product in the documentation, because I’m used to drawing everything so that in the moment of my weakness (illness, whatever) the team could handle it.

**That’s what solid leaders do, right?** After a time, I know that these are normal procedures in financial companies, the point is that **under the influence of emotions, do not do anything inappropriate.**

**I quickly forgot about it, that I was brutally fired. All that mattered was to bring my plan to life.**

**And it has been started, 15–20 hours a day every day. You have to believe me, getting back into the game was incredibly satisfying for me.** I didn’t even know that I would be so excited.

**Then we also noticed that someone was starting to think about the same product as me. So the race began a game against time and the market.**

I assume that if you **have reached this point**, you are **interested in product-market fit, marketing, and sales**, so let me explain **my assumptions to you**:

## Product:

A very very small tool that allowed you to automate proper tracking and creation of on-chain transactions. **Literally, the whole app for the user was located on only three subpages.**

## Starving Crowd:

**We tapped into an underserved market**. The crypto market primarily operates via communities on platforms like Discord, Reddit, Twitter, Telegram, and so on. **Therefore, our main strategy was directly communicating with users and demonstrating our tool**. This was essentially “free marketing” (excluding the time we invested), **as we did not need to invest in ads, promotional materials, or convince people about the efficacy of our tool.**

**The community could directly observe on-chain transactions executed by our algorithms, which were processed at an exceptionally fast rate.** This was something they couldn’t accomplish manually, so whenever someone conducted transactions using our algorithm, it was immediately noticeable and stirred a curiosity within the community **(how did they do that!)**.

## Tests:

I conducted the initial tests of the application on myself — we had already invested significantly in developing the product, **but I preferred risking my own resources over that of the users.** I provided the tool access to my wallet, containing 0.3ETH, and went to sleep. Upon waking up, I discovered that the transactions were successful and my wallet had grown to 0.99ETH. **My excitement knew no bounds, it felt like a windfall. But, of course, there was a fair chance I could have lost it too.**

**It worked**. As we progressed, some users achieved higher results, but it largely hinged on the parameters set by them. As you can surmise, the strategy was simple — **buy low, sell high**. There was considerable risk involved.

## Churn:

For those versed in marketing, the significance of repeat visitors cannot be overstated. Access to our tool was granted only after email verification and a special technique that I’d prefer to keep confidential. And this was all provided for free. While we had zero followers on social media, we saw an explosion in our email subscriber base and amassed a substantial number of users and advocates.

## Revenue Generation:

Our product quickly gained popularity as we were effectively helping users earn — an undeniable value proposition. Now, it was time to capitalize on our efforts. We introduced a subscription model charging $300 per week or $1,000 per month — seemingly high rates, but the demand was so intense that it wasn’t an issue. Being a subscriber meant you were prioritized in the queue, ensuring you were among the first to reap benefits — thus adding more “value”.

## Marketing:

**The quality of our product and its ability to continually engage users contributed to it achieving what can best be described as viral.**

It was both a source of pride and astonishment to witness **users sharing charts and analyses derived from our tool in forum discussions**. They weren’t actively promoting our product but rather using **screenshots from our application to illustrate certain aspects of the crypto world**.

By that stage, we had already assembled a team to assist with marketing, and programming, and to provide round-the-clock helpdesk support.

## Unforgettable Time:

Despite the hype, my focus remained **steadfast on monitoring our servers, their capacity, and speed. Considering we had only been on the market for a few weeks, we were yet to implement alerts, server scaling, etc.**

Our active user base spanned from **Japan** to the **West Coast of the United States**. Primarily, our application was used daily **during the evenings**, but considering the variety of time zones, the only time I could afford to sleep was during the evening hours in Far Eastern Europe, where we had the least users. **However, someone always needed to be on guard, and as such, my phone was constantly by my side. After all, we couldn’t afford to let our users down.**

We found ourselves working **20 hours a day**, catering to thousands of users, enduring physical fatigue, engaging in talks with **VCs**, and **participating in conferences.**

## Sudden Downturn:

**Our pinnacle was abruptly interrupted by the war in Ukraine (next macroeconomic shot straight in the face, lucky guy)**, a precipitous drop in cryptocurrency value, and **swiftly emerging competition**.

**By this time, there were 5–8 comparable tools** had infiltrated the market. It was a challenging period as we continually stumbled upon new rivals.

They immediately **embarked on swift fundraising endeavors — a strategy we overlooked, which in retrospect was a mistake.**

**Although our product was superior, the competitors’ rapid advancement and our insufficient funds for expeditious scaling posed significant challenges.**

**Nonetheless, we made a good decision. We sold the product (exit) to competitors. The revenue from “exit” compensated for all the losses, leaving us with enough rest.**

**We were a small team without substantial budgets for rapid development, and the risk of forming new teams without money to survive for more than 1–2 months was irresponsible.**

**You have to believe me that this decision consumed us sleepless nights.**

**Finally, we sold it. They turned off our app but took algorithms and users.**

Whether you believe it or not, **after several months of toiling day and night, experiencing burnout**, growing weary of the topic, and gaining an extra 15 kg in weight, **we finally found our freedom…**

**The exit wasn’t incredibly profitable**, but we knew they had outdone us. The exit covered all our **expenses and granted us a well-deserved rest for the subsequent quarter.**

**It was an insane ride**. Despite the uncertainty, stress, struggles, and sleepless nights, **the story and experience will remain etched in my memory for the rest of my life**.

## Swift Takeaways:

* Comprehending User Needs: Do you fully understand the **product-market fi**t? Is your offering just an accessory or does it truly satisfy the user’s needs?
* **The Power of Viral Marketing: Take inspiration from giants like Snapchat, ChatGPT, and Clubhouse**. While your product might not attain the same scale (**but remember, never say never…**), the closer your concept is to theirs, the easier your journey will be. **If your user is motivated to text a friend saying, “Hey, check out how cool this is” (like sharing ChatGPT), then you’re on the best track. Really.** Even if it doesn’t seem immediately evident, there could be a way to incorporate this into your product. Keep looking until you find it.
* **Niche targeting** — the more specific and tailored your product is to a certain audience, the easier your journey will be
* **People love buying from people** — establishing a personal brand and associating yourself with the product can make things easier.
* **Value: Seek to understand why users engage with your product and keep returning.**
* **The more specific and critical the issue you’re aiming to solve, the easier your path will be.** Consider your offerings in terms of products and services and focus on sales and marketing, regardless of personal sentiments.

These are just a few points, I plan to elaborate on all of them in a separate article.

Many products undergo years of development in search of market fit, refining the user experience, and more. **And guess what?** There’s absolutely nothing wrong with that.

**Each product and market follows its own rules. Many startups have extensive histories before they finally make their mark (for instance, OpenAI).**

This entire journey spanned maybe 6–8 months. I grasped and capitalized on the opportunity, but we understood from the start that establishing a startup carried a significant risk, and our crypto product was 10 times riskier.

**Was it worth it? Given my passion for product development — absolutely.**

**Was it profitable? — No, considering the hours spent — we lose.**

**Did it provide a stable, problem-free life — nope.**

**Did this entire adventure offer a wealth of happiness, joy, and unforgettable experiences — definitely yes.**

**One thing is certain — we’ve amassed substantial experience and it’s not over yet :)**

**So, what lies ahead?**

**Chapter 7: Reverting to the contractor, developing a product for a crypto Startup**Returning to the past, we continue our journey…

I had invested substantial time and passion into the tech rescue mission product. I came on board as the technical Team Leader of a startup that had garnered over $20M in seed round funding, affiliated with the realm of cryptocurrencies. The investors were individuals with extensive backgrounds in the crypto world.

**My role was primarily technical, and there was an abundance of work to tackle. I was fully immersed, and genuinely devoted to the role.** I was striving for excellence, knowing that if we secured another round of financing, **the startup would accelerate rapidly.**

**As for the product and marketing, I was more of an observer**.

After all, there were marketing professionals with decades of experience on board. These were individuals recruited from large crypto-related firms. I had faith in them, kept an eye on their actions, and focused on my own responsibilities. **However, the reality was far from satisfactory.**

**On the last day, the principal investor for the Series A round withdrew. The board made the tough decision to shut down. It was a period of intense observation and gaining experience in product management.**

**This was a very brief summary of the last 10 years.**

**And what next?**

## (Last) Chapter 8: To be announced — Product Owner / Product Consultant / Strategist / CTO

After spending countless hours and days deliberating my next steps, one thing is clear:

**My aspiration is to continue traversing the path of software product development, with the hopeful anticipation that one day, I might ride the crest of the next big wave and ascend to the prestigious status of a unicorn company.**

I find myself drawn to the process of building products, exploring product-market fit, strategizing, engaging in software development, seeking out new opportunities, networking, attending conferences, and continuously challenging myself by understanding the market and its competitive landscape.

## Product Owner / Product Consultant / CTO / COO:

I’m not entirely sure how to categorize this role, as I anticipate that it will largely depend on the product to which I will commit myself fully.

**My idea is to find one startup/company that wants to build a product / or already has a product, want to speed up, or simply doesn’t know what’s next.**

Alternatively, I could be a part of an established company with a rich business history, which intends to invest in digitization and technological advancements. The goal would be to enrich their customer experience by offering complementary digital products

**Rather than initiating a new venture from ground zero with the same team, I am receptive to new challenges.** I am confident that my past experiences will prove highly beneficial for the **founders of promising, burgeoning startups that already possess a product, or are in the initial phases of development.**

**‘Consultant’** — I reckon we interpret this term differently. My aim is to be completely absorbed in a single product, crafting funnels, niches, strategies, and all that is necessary to repeatedly achieve the ‘product-market fit’ and significant revenue. **To me, ‘consultant’ resonates more akin to freelancing than being an employee**.

**My current goal is to kickstart as a consultant and aide, dealing with facilitating startups in their journey from point A to B.**

**Here are two theoretical scenarios to illustrate my approach:** **Scenario 1:**

1. (**Starting from point A**) You have a product but struggle with marketing, adoption, software, strategy, sales, fundraising, or something else.
2. I conduct an analysis and develop a strategy to reach point B.
3. I take on the **“dirty work”** and **implement** necessary changes, including potential pivots or shifts (going all-in) to guide the product to point B.
4. **The goal is to reach point B, which could involve achieving a higher valuation, expanding the user base, increasing sales, or generating monthly revenue, among other metrics.**

**Scenario 2:**

1. (**Starting from point A**) You have a plan or idea but face challenges with marketing, adoption, strategy, software, sales, fundraising, or something else.
2. I analyze the situation and devise a strategy to reach **point B**.
3. I tackle the necessary tasks, build the team, and overcome obstacles to propel the product to **point B**.

I have come across the view that finding the elusive product-market fit is the job of the founder, and it’s hard for me to disagree.

However, I believe that my support and experiences can help save money, many failures, and most importantly, time. I have spent a great deal of time learning from my mistakes, enduring failure after failure, and even had no one to ask for support or opinion, which is why I offer my help. Saving even a couple of years, realistically speaking, seems like a value I’m eager to provide…

**I invite you to share your thoughts and insights on these scenarios :)**

## Closing Remarks:

**I appreciate your time and effort in reaching this point.** This has been my journey, and I wouldn’t change it for the world. I had an extraordinary adventure, and now **I’m ready for the next exciting battle with the market and new software products.**

While my entire narrative is centered around startups, especially the ones I personally built, I’m planning to share more insights drawn from all of my experiences, not just those as a co-founder.

**If you’re currently developing your product or even just considering the idea, I urge you to reach out to me. Perhaps together, we can create something monumental :)**

**Thank you for your time and insights. I eagerly look forward to engaging in discussions and hearing your viewpoints. Please remember to like and subscribe. Nothing motivates to write more than positive feedback :)**

14ivyg3,2,2023-06-25,"Rant : I don't know what to do, and it's got to the point where suicidal thoughts often cross my mind like daydreams",u/GreenerPeach01,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/14ivyg3/rant_i_dont_know_what_to_do_and_its_got_to_the/,"Warning : all of this is coming straight out of my rear end, so it's a little jumbled here and there:

So, I'm a 24F, and i've been technically unemployed since september 2021. I was in a master's program at a reputed university from 2021 to 2022, but it was too expensive, so I left. I'm kind of all over the place here, because I am a very intense, stubborn personality, but that's literally the only reason I'm even alive today. It's literally the only reason I have held back from suicidal thoughts time and time again. 

I never did a proper diagnosis of it, but I think I may have borderline autism/asperger's, and definitely a type of anxiety/depression. I have a very childlike personality, and I'm very creative, artistic, intuitive, at the heart of it, never been practical tbh.  My dad's an IITian, like core, everything, btech, masters, phd, everything in IIT. and that's been my biggest privilege externally as much as it's been my nightmare internally. What's happened is, ever since i graduated from high school, I didn't really have a plan for myself practically. i wasn't dumb, i just never studied for the sake of getting a job or career, but because I genuinely wanted to be educated and liked learning. Problem is, almost every decision that's been made for me has been what made my parents happy for a career they want me to do (more so my dad, my mom just listens to him), but just built up to become worse and worse for me inside, and I never could tell them.

problem is, in high school i kept fighting the odds of always being in situations which never were helpful for me to act on my interests, because I still had hope, cause I was stubborn and believed in better. 

then college was a shitstorm. I was stuck in this ""transfer"" engineering program which looking back on it was literally a scam handed to us on a platter if you could pay. after 2 years, we had to study in india, then move to another country (AUS, UK, etc) for the next two years to get our degree from. and to put this into perspective: the odds of me getting into a US university, which is where I wanted to go at the time cause it's where I'm from and my parents wanted the same, was literally about 10%. and that too, a good US university. i know so many people there who were interested in engineering, unlike me, and even they failed the first semester and left it. so imagine my situation: i'm stuck in this program I don't want to be in, I AM NOT EVEN FUCKING INTERESTED IN ENGINEERING FOR GODS SAKE, and i gotta get out of this program which is by no means in any way or form even moderately close to my interests, and get to a good university in the US for which chances are nill, even though this stupid program scammed me and my parents into thinking that it's 100% possible in the first place. 

i don't even wanna look back on those two years, but then remember all the built up issues i had in high till that point? yeah, that was minimal compared to what happened here. from this point on, this not only tripled the built up anxiety and issues I had, through having to hustle academically and basically maintain that fake it till you make it, but it reflected in my health with severe health issues like PCOS, MTD, panic attacks that i had to keep controlling, etc. oh, and the premature greying started. thank god, my parents interests were forced upon me almost all my life, leading to me lying to myself, but atleast my body couldn't lie and it reflected in my absolute zero mind-body connection. 

i completed 90 credits in those two years, and eventually got into a good university in the US, and guess how much transferred? bloody 38 credits. now if i wanna complete my degree in 2 years, i gotta do 82 credits in 2 years. oh, and I transferred there in Fall 2019. only one semester i could spend on campus before covid hit. 

i had to go back to India to stay with my parents in march 2020, and from there i completed my degree. despite 82 credits in 2 years on my ass, i wanted to use this chance to try some other things. before returning home, from jan-feb 2020, I took an introductory theater class, and got selected for callbacks for a college musical production which i blindly auditioned for, the only one who was selected with no prior experience, and was sitting amongst other people there who were fourth year students, and other theatre professionals performing in the local scene who knew the director beforehand and they had contacts and stuff, and it was fun to do rehearsals and get to know all of them. i took up theatre as a minor. 

and then hell began when i moved back home. from 2020-2021, working from international timezone. it ruined my sleep schedule, and with it my health. since i was at home reminded of how i live in opposite world from my parents all over again, i got even more premature greying, and my hearing my mom rant and yell about how beautiful i used to look in India and then how since I went to the US i've got short hair and am now ugly af. The pandemic was a tough time for all of us, needless to say. my health issues, physical and mental, started in 2017 and continued all the way till 2023. 

but actually my degree experience was relatively better and fun. i made friends, i got good contacts, minoring in theatre gave me two amazing classes which gave me a lot of exposure and were literally places where I was as myself, as I was conflicted with who i've been coerced to be all these years. I even took up a writing course on Roman civilization, which I found genuinely interesting and engaging, and for my midterm paper, I was told by my professor that my paper is one of the best midterm papers she's ever seen in all her years of teaching the course. Needless to say, I was able to bag a recommendation from her. And a couple professors here and there. I also got the chance to work and craft and get in touch with my intuition side and my creative, intense, deep side. It's how I was able to draft essays the day before, you know, back in the day, before we had the shenanigans now called chatgpt to step in and do the technical writing for us.

I was still afraid to really step outside my shell, and thought I would do so once I got a job in my major, that is, math concentrated in statistics and data science. So i was applying from september 2021 onwards, real hard, and finally got a job in a big company. I accepted it. Now, what would happen was absolute chaos. With me not demanding at all, my onboarding date kept getting postponed for almost a year time, and finally, when I got to join, things went down bad, and I left this year. even my father knew it was terrible what happened to me. and it genuinely made me lost trust in corporate culture beforehand, as I understood and dealt with the bad side of them from this experience itself. 

but this year off i've had, since i graduated in sep 2021, has been the most eye-opening and mentally revolutionary time for me. it's been possibly the best time for me to actually connect with my intuition, for my health to go up, for my depression to come down, for me not to panic at the idea of anything moderately related to what my parents want from me. point is, there's a way i could have done all this without it making me immediately self-panic myself just to get myself into that ""hustle"" mentality. but it didn't work out that way, no big deal. i've got to explore all my skills as a writer, artist, all of GP02. my mom and i have connected well, she knows what i am and where my talents lie, it's my dad who doesn't have a clue. i genuinely need a job which can exercise my writing, my critical thinking, my ability to critique music, dance and forms of entertainment well, and i don't wanna feel like i have to sell my soul to a corporate job. if i can find one that's good, great. but this year off has toughened me as much as it has been the best year for me, even if i haven't done anything. even though i was still staying with my parents, it was me taking care of myself, me fixing myself, and me figuring out what I am after so many years of just silently abiding to what my parents wanted from me, and all those years my inner voice just screeching out to want to be heard and this year, I've finally heard it. I'd rather die, sincerely, than to lose this again. Call me stupid, but frankly it's either this or my health kills me anyway from further digging myself further in this path I don't like. My father claims to be a mentor, but he hates anyone who doesn't like or criticizes his field of work, and someone living in his very house does that. 

**TLDR**: I graduated in september 2021 with a degree in math concentrated in stats and data science. since, I needed to take time off to truly get in touch with my intuition, which has been sort of pushed down for years and years from going after dreams my parents wanted for me and built up for me, but the dreams my dad built up for me are synonymous with the depression and suicidal intentions that built up in me over the years. But, yet, here I am, a stubborn little shit, so I'm still alive and I still believe I can put my intuition to some use and break out of my fate with my father. 

As much as someone looking at my resume can brush off my break as me being lazy and doing nothing, I would have literally committed suicide had this break not come to me, and in an odd way it's sort of got me in touch spiritually too, idk. My intuition is strongly creative, artistic, very introspective, deep thinker, musically-inclined (singing will take some time, I have to cure my MTD, but songwriting is definitely there), dancing, entertainment, writing side. I also think I'm fairly good at asking questions, and feel like I could be one of those podcast youtubers like Steven from Diary of a CEO or something. I got the chance to prove my abilities in college, but due to my mental health issues and not being in touch during the pandemic, I shut out these people from my life. I want to prove myself professionally with this intuition I have, and it's been almost two years since i graduated (Sep 2021-now). the rat race that college took me through ruined me and my issues built up from 2017-2023, and i cannot go back to it after such a wonderful time away from what ruined my health and pushed me further away from what i am. at this point, i even think about dying as a revenge to my father to know what a failure he's been (k, that one's a little too much sorry about that)

I have looked into freelancing, but it seems like there's so many options out there, I don't know where to start in a way that least feels like I have to give up who I am and my more not-so-corporate-friendly beliefs. "

----------

(Disclaimer: All characters are at least 18 years old)

As you enter Ms. Martin's classroom, she turns to you and greets you with a smile. ""What can I do for you, Marcus?"" she asks. You take a deep breath and say “Ms. Martin, can I talk to you in private for a moment?"". She nods and gestures for you to follow her to her office.

Once inside, you take a deep breath, steeling yourself for what you're about to say. ""It's about...us,"" you say, your voice barely above a whisper. ""I have feelings for you, Ms. Martin. Romantic feelings.""

Ms. Martin listens patiently, her expression neutral. ""I see,"" she says simply. ""Well, Marcus, I appreciate your honesty, but I'm afraid I can't return your feelings. I recently got a divorce, and I'm not looking for a relationship right now.""

But then, she surprises you with her next words. ""However, there is something else I've been considering,"" she says. ""I still want to have a child, and I don't want to wait for the right person to come along. If you're willing to help me with that, I'd be willing to have sex with you.""

At first, you're taken aback by her proposal. But you quickly realize that you're eager to do whatever it takes to be with her. ""Yes, I'll do it,"" you say, your heart racing. Ms. Martin nods and stands up, moving to lock the office door. As she does so, you take a moment to take in her appearance: her curly brown hair falling in loose waves around her face, her slim figure accentuated by her form-fitting dress.

Once the door is locked, Ms. Martin turns to face you, her expression businesslike. ""This will be a purely physical arrangement, Marcus,"" she says. ""No emotions, no strings attached. Do you understand?"" You nod eagerly.

You try to move in and kiss Ms. Martin, but she stops you with a hand on your chest. ""No kissing,"" she says firmly. ""This is just sex, Marcus. We don't need to complicate it with emotions.""

You nod, feeling a little disappointed but still eager to continue. As you start to undress, Ms. Martin follows suit, slipping off her pants and panties but leaving her top on. You take a moment to appreciate the sight of her slim legs and the curve of her hips before she speaks again.

""Why are you hesitating, Marcus?"" she asks. ""Take off your clothes and get ready to fuck me.""

You quickly strip down, standing naked before her as she watches you with a neutral expression. ""You’re not going to remove your top?"" You ask. She raises an eyebrow and says ""You only need to be able to fuck me, nothing more. Now come here.""

Ms. Martin clears her desk and sits on top, spreading her legs to reveal her pussy. You can see that she's already wet and ready for you, and you feel a rush of excitement as you step closer. Her pussy is shaved clean, with just a small strip of hair above it. You can see the pinkness of her inner labia and the way her clit peeks out from its hood.

""Now, Marcus,"" she says, her voice low and commanding. ""Fuck me.""

You step closer to Ms. Martin, your heart racing with excitement and nerves as this is your first time having sex. You position yourself between her legs. As you slide your cock into her wet pussy, you feel an intense pleasure that you've never experienced before. With each thrust, your pleasure grows, and moans leak out.

But just as quickly as it began, it's over. You feel yourself cumming, your whole body shaking with pleasure as you empty yourself inside Ms. Martin. You've never felt anything like it before, and you collapse onto her desk, panting and exhausted.

Ms. Martin looks down at you with a satisfied smile. ""Well done, Marcus,"" she says, patting your head like a dog. ""You came quickly and didn't waste my time. I appreciate that.""

As Ms. Martin gets off the desk, you can see the cum oozing out of her pussy, coating her inner thighs. You feel a surge of desire as you watch her move, and you can't help but ask for more.

""Please, Ms. Martin,"" you say, your voice a little desperate. ""Can we do it again? My cock is still so hard.""

Ms. Martin sighs, but doesn’t protest. As she gets back onto the desk and spreads her legs once again, you can see her cum-filled pussy up close. The sight of it is both erotic and overwhelming. Her labia are swollen and red, glistening with a mixture of her own arousal and your cum. You can see the pinkness of her inner folds, slick with wetness, and the way her clit peeks out from its hood.

The cum you've already deposited inside her is slowly oozing out, coating her inner thighs and dripping down onto the desk. It's a messy and erotic sight, and you feel yourself growing harder at the thought of adding more to the mixture. Ms. Martin's pussy is both beautiful and inviting, and you can't resist the urge to slide your cock back inside and feel the wetness and tightness around you.

""Okay, Marcus,"" she says. ""One more time, but then we're done.""

As you slide your cock back into Ms. Martin's cum-filled pussy, you can feel a difference from the first time. The wetness and tightness around you are more intense, and the sensation of your own cum mixing with her juices is both erotic and overwhelming. You thrust harder and faster, feeling the pleasure building until you're on the edge of orgasm once again.

This time, you manage to hold off a little longer, feeling the pleasure intensifying until you're moaning with ecstasy. Ms. Martin caresses your face, and runs her fingers through your hair as you desperately thrust into her pussy. Finally, you can't hold back any longer, and you cum inside her once again.

Your whole body tenses as you orgasm, and you can feel your cock pulsing as you shoot your load deep inside her. The sensation of your cum filling her up is intense and erotic, and you can feel it mixing with the cum already inside her. You keep thrusting for a few more moments, prolonging the pleasure as much as you can before finally pulling out and collapsing onto her desk, panting and exhausted.

As you lay there, you can feel your cock still twitching with aftershocks of pleasure, and you can see Ms. Martin's pussy twitching slightly as well. The sight of your cum oozing out of her is both erotic and overwhelming, and you feel a surge of pride at the thought of having impregnated her.

While you rest your head on her desk, Ms. Martin gets off the desk and picks up her panties off the ground. She steps into them, pulling them up along her cum-coated thighs and over her dripping pussy with a sense of practiced ease. 

The fabric clings to her wet skin, and you can see the outline of her swollen labia through the rapidly growing wet spot created by your cum. The cum mingles with the fabric, creating a sticky mess that you can't help but find erotic. She adjusts the panties, smoothing them out over her hips before reaching down to wipe away some of the cum on her thighs with a tissue.

Recovering from your intense orgasm, you start to put your clothes back on. You can't resist asking Ms. Martin a simple question. ""When can I see you again?"" you ask, eager for more. ""We'll see, Marcus,"" Ms. Martin says, her tone noncommittal. ""You shot two loads into me today, so I'm probably pregnant already.""

""And remember, Marcus,"" she says firmly. ""This has to be our little secret. Nobody can know about this."" You nod. ""I won't tell anyone,” you promise. Ms. Martin looks at you for a moment, her eyes searching yours before nodding in agreement. ""Good,"" she says. ""I'll see you in class, Marcus.""

Over the next week, you continue to attend school as normal, but Ms. Martin doesn't call you to have sex with her again. You try to focus on your studies, but your mind keeps wandering back to the erotic experiences you shared with her in her office.

One day, as you're sitting in Ms. Martin's class, she drops the whiteboard eraser. As she bends over to pick it up, you get the perfect view of her ass pointed in your direction. You can't help but stare. It's round and firm, with just the right amount of jiggle as she moves. The fabric of her skirt stretches tight over her curves, outlining the shape of her butt perfectly.

As you look at her ass, you feel a surge of arousal that you can't ignore. You imagine what it would feel like to slide your cock between those cheeks, feeling the smoothness of her skin and the tightness around you. You continue to stare, feeling a surge of arousal as you imagine thrusting your cock into her pussy once again.

After class, you rush to the bathroom to masturbate, trying to relieve the tension that's been building up inside you all week. You imagine Ms. Martin's wet pussy as you stroke yourself, feeling the pleasure building. You feel the tension building to a breaking point, until you finally cum, imagining the sensation of your hot seed filling Ms. Martin's pussy once again.

As the days pass, you find yourself consumed by the desire to feel Ms. Martin's wet and tight pussy around you again. The memory of your previous encounter with her fills your mind, and you can't stop imagining the sensation of sliding into her, feeling the warmth and wetness of her folds.

Mercifully, two weeks later, Ms. Martin suddenly calls you to her office after class. You were a little nervous as you sit down, wondering what she wanted to talk about. ""It turns out that unfortunately, you didn't get me pregnant,"" she said, her tone a little regretful. ""But I still want to continue to try, Marcus. I think it might work if you creampied me every day for a month.""

You feel a surge of excitement at her words, realizing that you'll finally get to fuck her again. ""Okay,"" you say eagerly. ""I can do that."" Over the next couple of weeks, you find yourself going to Ms. Martin's office every day after school to have sex with her. You cum inside her every time, hoping that this time will be the one that gets her pregnant. Incredibly, such a forbidden and exciting encounter has now become almost routine, a regular part of your daily schedule. 

You've had this fantasy of having sex with your teacher, Ms. Martin, for as long as you can remember. Ever since you first saw her in class, you've been captivated by her beauty, intelligence, and confidence. You've spent countless hours daydreaming about what it would be like to touch her, kiss her, and explore every inch of her body. You’ve spilled so much of your seed into tissues imagining what it would feel like to fuck her raw and cum inside her.

But you never thought that this fantasy could actually come true. You assumed that it would always be just that - a fantasy, a secret desire that you would never be able to fulfill. And yet, here you are, living out that fantasy with the woman of your dreams.

Even though she won't let you touch or kiss her, you still love every moment of it. The feeling of her wet and tight pussy around you, the sound of flesh slapping together as you thrust into her, and the knowledge that you're fulfilling a taboo fantasy that many people only dream of is enough to make you feel like you're on top of the world.

You know that other guys in your class would kill to be in your position, and it makes you feel even luckier to be the one she chose to impregnate her. You feel like you're living out a secret fantasy that no one else knows about, and it makes the experience even more thrilling.

One day after school, you find yourself in Ms. Martin's office once again, with her bent over her desk and grading papers while you fuck her from behind in the doggy style position. As usual, she still has her shirt on, but has removed her pants and panties, giving you full access to her wet and tight pussy.

As you thrust into her, you feel the sensation of her walls gripping tightly around you, sending waves of pleasure through your body. You close your eyes and moan softly, savoring the feeling of her ass against your thighs and the sound of your bodies slapping together.

""God, you feel so good,"" you whisper, your voice filled with lust and desire. Ms. Martin turns her head slightly and scolds you, ""Hush, Marcus. I'm trying to grade these papers.""

As you look down at her ass, you can't help but feel a surge of arousal. It's round and firm, with just the right amount of jiggle as you move in and out of her. The curve of her hips leads down to two perfectly formed pale cheeks that seem to beg for your attention. As you grip Ms. Martin's hips tightly, you can see the way your fingers press into her skin, leaving faint marks behind. The contrast between the paleness of her skin and the redness of your grip is mesmerizing. 

Her cheeks jiggle slightly with each thrust, creating a hypnotic rhythm that you can't help but watch. The sight of her bent over her desk like this, completely focused on her work as you fuck her from behind, is almost too much to handle. The wet sound of flesh meeting flesh fills the air, punctuated by your occasional gasp or moan of pleasure.

You continue to fuck her with abandon, as Ms. Martin mumbles to herself about what points she’s taking off from the paper she's grading, fully concentrated on her work almost ignoring your presence. The sounds of your moans mix with the sound of her pen scratching on paper, creating a symphony of pleasure and productivity.

Mesmerized by the sight of her ass bouncing and jiggling with each thrust, you’re unable to resist the temptation, so you reach out and give her a firm slap on the ass. The sound of the slap echoes in the room, and you feel the flesh of her ass reverberate under your hand. The sensation of her skin against your palm is electrifying. You can see the red mark left by your hand on her skin and you feel a surge of lust and desire wash over you. 

Ms. Martin turns her head and gives you a stern look. ""Marcus,"" she says sharply. ""I'm trying to work here. Can you please control yourself?""

Suddenly, you and Ms. Martin hear the sound of the lock turning, and panic sets in. You quickly pull out of her, and Ms. Martin hastily tries to hide you behind her desk as she looks for her pants and panties. The door opens and you hear someone stepping in. You hear a female voice saying ""Oh my god, I'm so sorry. I didn't know you were having sex in here.""

You stand up and see that it's Ms. Hepburne, another teacher at the school. Her eyes are shielded in surprise from the sight of you and Ms. Martin having sex. Ms. Hepburne is wearing a tight-fitting dress that hugs her curves. The dress is made of a black, stretchy material that clings to her body, accentuating her hourglass figure. The neckline is low, revealing a hint of cleavage, and the dress is sleeveless, showing off her toned arms. The hem of the dress falls just above her knees, emphasizing her long, toned legs. She's wearing black high heels that add to her height and give her a sense of confidence and power. Her shoulder-length dirty blonde hair is styled in loose waves that frame her face, and she's wearing a subtle layer of makeup that highlights her natural beauty.

Ms. Martin heaves a sigh of relief and greets her with only relief in her voice. ""Ms. Hepburne, hi. I wasn't expecting you."" Ms. Hepburne steps into the room, surprise quickly being replaced by excitement. ""Is this him?"" she asks, pointing at you. ""Is this the student you told me about?""

""He's quite good-looking, isn't he?"" Ms. Martin says. You can detect the barest hint of pride leaking into her voice. 

“I can’t believe how big his cock is!” Ms. Hepburne marvels as she steps closer to inspect your member. 

“I suppose it’s adequate.” Ms. Martin agrees. 

“Adequate?” Ms. Hepburne scoffs. “I’ve let a lot of students fuck me and none of them have a cock this nice.”

Your face turns red and you feel embarrassed hearing the two talk about your penis. You’re unsure of what to do or say as Ms. Hepburne squats down before you and prods at your twitching cock, which had been moments from release before she walked in.

Ms. Martin sees the strain on your face and bends back over her desk. She spreads herself again before turning to you and saying, ""You can keep fucking me, Marcus.""

You obediently slip back into her folds as Ms. Hepburne watches you fuck Ms. Martin, her eyes glancing between the two of you. After a moment, she turns to you and asks, ""So, Marcus, what have you done with Ms. Martin so far?""

""Um, well, we've had sex a bunch of times,"" you say, your voice a little strained with pleasure. “Ms. Martin lets me cum inside her every time.”

Ms. Hepburne raises an eyebrow. ""And what else?"" she asks, a hint of curiosity in her voice. You hesitate before answering. ""Nothing, really. She hasn't given me a blowjob or let me kiss her or anything like that.""

Ms. Hepburne looks even more surprised. ""Wow, Ms. Martin, I can't believe you haven't even let him kiss you. What's going on?"" Ms. Martin sighs. ""I'm not here for pleasure, Ms. Hepburne. I'm only interested in getting pregnant. Kisses and blowjobs don't help me achieve that goal.""

Ms. Hepburne shakes her head, clearly not satisfied with Ms. Martin's answer. ""But still, you could at least let him have a little fun, right? I mean, you're not a robot, and he’s doing you a big favor.""

Ms. Hepburne turns back to you, a seductive smile playing on her lips. ""If I had you, Marcus, I'd do everything with you. Kissing, blowjobs, rimming, the works. I wouldn't be able to resist,"" she says, her voice low and sultry. Before you can even react, Ms. Hepburne leans in and starts kissing you. Her lips are soft and full, and her tongue slides easily into your mouth, exploring every inch with a hunger that matches your own. As you continue to fuck Ms. Martin from behind, Ms. Hepburne's hands roam over your chest and shoulders, feeling every inch of you as she deepens the kiss. She tastes sweet, like strawberries and champagne, and you can't help but moan into her mouth as the passion between you intensifies. 

But just as you start to lose yourself in the moment, Ms. Martin's voice cuts through the haze, her tone annoyed. ""What is going on back there?"" she demands, turning her head to look at you and Ms. Hepburne. 

Ms. Hepburne pulls away from the kiss, a mischievous smile on her face. ""Just having a little fun, Ms. Martin,"" she says. Ms. Martin's eyes narrow. ""Don't try to steal him, Ms. Hepburne,"" she says, her tone firm.

""Relax, Ms. Martin. I'm not going to steal him with a kiss,"" she says with a grin. ""If I wanted to steal him, I'd do something like this.""

Ms. Hepburne drops to her knees, and with a playful smile on her lips, she reaches down between your bodies and finds your cock. With a sudden motion, she pulls your cock out of Ms. Martin's pussy, causing you to gasp in surprise. You can feel the sudden rush of cool air on your cock as it leaves Ms. Martin’s warm wet hole behind. 

“Hey! What the hell?” Ms. Martin protests, her tone annoyed.

Ms. Hepburne positions herself between your legs and immediately wraps her lips around the head of your cock. The two of you lock eyes as she starts to suck you. You can feel the pleasure rapidly building, the sensation of her lips and tongue sending shivers of ecstasy through your body. You can't help but moan in pleasure as she takes you deep into her mouth, her hands stroking your shaft as she bobs her head up and down. Her mouth is warm and wet, and you can feel her tongue sliding up and down your shaft, exploring every inch of your cock with an expert touch.

As she works you towards orgasm, you can feel the tension building in your body, your muscles tightening and your breath coming in short, ragged gasps. You were already so close before from fucking Ms. Martin, and now Ms. Hepburne’s lips and tongue are working in perfect harmony to bring you even closer to the edge. 

Suddenly, with a surge of pleasure that takes you by surprise, you feel the first spasms of orgasm shoot through your body. Ms. Hepburne's mouth is still working its magic on your cock, and you can feel her tongue swirling around the head of your cock as you start to shoot your load. The sensation is overwhelming, and you can't help but moan in pleasure as you come hard, your cum shooting deep into Ms. Hepburne's waiting mouth. She keeps her lips wrapped tightly around your cock, milking every last drop out of you as you moan in pleasure.

Ms. Martin interrupts your blissful moment. ""Marcus, you should be cumming inside me, not in Ms. Hepburne's mouth,"" she complains, her tone irritated.

Ms. Hepburne doesn't swallow your cum, instead keeping it in her mouth as she stands up. You can see the bulge of it in her cheeks as she smiles at you. She turns to Ms. Martin, a mischievous glint in her eyes. ""Do you still want Marcus's cum?” she asks, her speech slightly garbled by the cum in her mouth. “I can spit it into your pussy instead of swallowing it.”

Ms. Martin sighs and nods, clearly annoyed but still wanting to get pregnant from your cum. She climbs up onto her desk and positions her hips in the air. She stretches open her pussy with her fingers, giving Ms. Hepburne a clear target. Ms. Hepburne leans over Ms. Martin's open legs, positioning her mouth over your teacher's waiting pussy. With a final, teasing smile, she spits your cum into Ms. Martin's eager hole, and uses her fingers to work it in deeper. 

As Ms. Hepburne leans over Ms. Martin's open legs spitting your cum in, you can't help but steal a glance at her perfect ass, appreciating the way her dress clings to her body like a second skin. You even catch a glimpse of her panties, a pair made of delicate lace, the fabric stretched taut against the curve of her ass. You can see every detail of her perfect cheeks, the smooth skin interrupted only by the thin line of fabric that runs down the cleft of her ass.

You feel a sudden surge of desire, unable to resist any longer. You reach out and hike up Ms. Hepburne's dress, yanking down her panties and exposing her bare ass to the air. Without hesitation, you plunge your cock into her waiting pussy, feeling the tightness of her walls grip you tightly. 

Ms. Hepburne gasps in surprise, her body jerking forward as you take her from behind. ""Oh, Marcus,"" she moans, her voice thick with pleasure. ""I can't believe you're doing this."" 

""I'm sorry, Ms. Hepburne,"" you say, your voice quivering with pleasure. ""I couldn't resist. You're just too damn sexy."" She quickly gets into the rhythm of your thrusts, her hips rocking back and forth as she takes you deep inside her. She moans in pleasure, her eyes closed in ecstasy as you pound into her relentlessly. 

Ms. Martin's voice breaks through the haze of pleasure. ""What are you two doing now?"" she asks, annoyed. ""Shh,” Ms. Hepburne says, her tone teasing while putting a finger on Ms. Martin’s lips. ""Let me make it up to you.""

And with that, she leans in, burying her face in Ms. Martin's pussy and starting to eat her out with wild abandon. Surprisingly, Ms. Martin moans in pleasure, her hips bucking against Ms. Hepburne's face as she rides the waves of pleasure. Ms. Hepburne's tongue dances over Ms. Martin's pussy, teasing the sensitive flesh and sending shivers of pleasure through her body. Ms. Martin moans in ecstasy, her fingers tangled in Ms. Hepburne's hair as she rides the waves of pleasure. As Ms. Hepburne eats out Ms. Martin, you continue to fuck Ms. Hepburne from behind, your cock sliding easily in and out of her wet and tight pussy. You can feel her body tightening around you with each thrust.

Ms. Martin's pleasure is palpable, and you can see the ecstasy written all over her face. She arches her back, her hips bucking against Ms. Hepburne's face as she grinds against her, desperate for more. You've never seen Ms. Martin like this before, and the sight of her completely lost in pleasure is etched into your mind, driving you wild. 

Ms. Hepburne's touch is expert, and she seems to know exactly how to drive Ms. Martin wild with desire. She flicks her tongue over her clit, circling it with increasing speed and intensity as Ms. Martin's moans grow louder and more urgent. Ms. Hepburne's fingers slip inside her, teasing her g-spot with deft strokes as she continues to feast on her pussy.

It's not long before Ms. Martin's pleasure reaches a fever pitch, her body tensing up as she gets closer and closer to orgasm. Ms. Hepburne doesn't let up, continuing to lick and suck and stroke until finally, with a final cry of pleasure, Ms. Martin cums hard, legs wrapping around Ms. Hepburne’s head. Her entire body shudders with intense pleasure, and her moans echo through the room. 

As you continue to fuck Ms. Hepburne, her body begins to writhe beneath yours, her own moans joining Ms. Martin’s in a growing chorus. You can feel her muscles tightening around you, her pussy clenching and unclenching with each thrust. The pleasure is almost too much to bear, and you know that both of you are getting close to cumming. You quicken your pace, pounding into Ms. Hepburne with wild abandon as you feel the orgasm building deep inside you. With a final surge of pleasure, you explode inside Ms. Hepburne, your cum shooting out in thick, hot ropes. You can feel it filling her up, and you moan in ecstasy as you continue to thrust into her, riding out the waves of pleasure.

Ms. Hepburne's body shudders beneath you as she cums, her pussy clenching around your cock as she rides out her own orgasm. You collapse onto Ms. Hepburne’s back, exhausted and panting. The three of you are lost in a haze of pleasure, your bodies entwined in a tangle of limbs and sweat.

As the intense pleasure subsides, the three of you slowly begin to put your clothes back on. Ms. Hepburne pulls her panties and dress back up, adjusting them carefully as she looks over at you and Ms. Martin. 

""Wow,"" Ms. Heburne says, a hint of awe in her voice. ""That was intense. I don't think I've ever been that turned on before."" Ms. Martin nods in agreement, a sense of satisfaction written all over her face. ""It was definitely... memorable,"" she says, her voice slightly breathless.

Ms. Hepburne looks up at you and Ms. Martin with a mischievous glint in her eyes. ""So, can I borrow Marcus from time to time?"" she asks, her voice teasing. Ms. Martin's expression darkens immediately. ""Absolutely not,"" she says, her voice stern. ""This was a one-time thing, and it's not going to happen again.""

Ms. Hepburne nods understandingly, but as Ms. Martin isn't looking, she slips you a piece of paper with her number on it. ""Text me,"" she whispers, a hint of desire in her eyes. You can't help but feel a little thrill of excitement as you slip the paper into your pocket.

And now my tips and insights:

This was written using poe.com’s ChatGPT 3.5. For my experiment last time I tried to get it to output a cohesive story across responses when responses were compiled in sequence without edits. In the end it worked, but it took a lot of prompting to get it to do it right, and not write events beyond what I wanted. Even then, a lot of times I had to settle for fewer descriptions than I liked. I did things more loosely this time, and added in some organization on my end. Personally I think it made a much better and more descriptive story. 

First I gave it prompts that were more general to establish the sequence of events properly. In the vast majority of these cases, Narotica did not give enough descriptions and glossed over many things. I would then follow up it up with multiple requests for greater detail. “Describe in detail how Ms. Hepburne spit my cum into Ms. Martin’s pussy and how she reacts.” Or “describe in detail how Ms. Hepburne eats Ms. Martin out and how Ms. Martin cums”. I would then regenerate the response multiple times, pulling out the parts from each response that I liked into a word document and stitched it together to be a cohesive story with logical flow. 

I deleted, edited and resubmitted prompts *a lot*, editing them to ensure that Narotica had the general idea correct before asking it to provide more detailed descriptions of things. Once I got the details, I pieced together various parts of descriptions from the responses I liked into my word document. Piecing together the best parts of multiple responses lead to some extremely vivid descriptions that I absolutely loved in this story. This was also where I had to exercise a bit of my own creativity, deciding what lines to use, and occasionally changing up some transition words to make it flow better or borrowing phrases from other responses to make sure it didn’t sound like it was overly repetitive. I also made sure to correct any logical inconsistences I found if the writing was otherwise something I liked. For example at one point, I had a perfectly good response but Narotica had gotten confused and was writing that I was both fucking Ms. Martin and getting a blowjob from Ms. Hepburne at the same time. I simply kept the response and added it to my story while deleting the contradictory sentences. 

I found that in general this approach worked best when asking it to describe about 4 events per response. Fewer than that, and Narotica often tried to fill in the gaps for you, sending the story in directions you didn't want, or describing future events you had already planned differently. More than that, and it often left out events. 

To get a really good story you have to be prepared to be the director of this show and tell Narotica exactly what to write. It's fine to start off with rather general prompts like “Another teacher walks in on us having sex. Describe her reaction. Write a conversation between her and Ms. Martin. This new teacher is not shocked and does not disapprove of this relationship” to let Narotica fill in the blanks and give you some ideas. However, you have to be the one to pick a final direction and direct Narotica to write what you want to see, ending up with a prompt like this: ""Suddenly we hear the lock turn. Both of us panic and ms. martin tries to hide me. She sees Ms. Hepburne walks in. She is another teacher with shoulder length dirty blonde hair. Describe what she is wearing. Ms. Hepburne is surprised at first saying oh my god then apologizes that she didn't know we were having sex in here. Ms. Martin breathes a sigh of relief. Write a dialogue where Ms. Martin calmly greets her. Ms. Hepburne becomes excited. Write lines of dialogue where she asks Ms. Martin excitedly if I'm the student she chose to impregnate her. Ms. Martin says yes. Write a conversation with 6 lines of dialogue between Ms. Martin and Ms. Hepburne where they talk about me, how good I look and how big my cock is. I'm left baffled and embarrassed and I'm unsure what I should do. Write 1 line of dialogue where Ms. Martin tells me I can keep fucking her."" 

To get good dialogue between the characters, use the phrases “write a conversation”, “write a dialogue”, and/or ""write lines of dialogue"" a lot. For example, this was my opening prompt leading to the start of the story: “Write a dialogue where Marcus goes after school to Ms. Martin and asks to see her in private. He confesses his love to her and surprisingly she does not turn him down. she explains that she recently got a divorce but still wants a child. She tells me that if I'm ok with getting her pregnant, she'll have sex with me. I agree and say yes eagerly. Ms. Martin goes to lock the door. Weave in descriptions of Ms. Martin. Do not write Ms. Martin acting affectionate or seductive. Her statements should be matter-of-fact. The response should include heavy dialogue. Do not write any events occurring after Ms. Martin locks the door.” If Narotica doesn’t give you enough dialogue on the first try, you can regenerate the response a few times. It will often choose different parts to give voice to, and you can stitch parts from multiple responses together to get a completely voiced segment. If there are specific parts that it seems to never want to write dialogue for, try editing the prompt in that particular spot to say “write 2 lines of dialogue where…”. Sometimes you get a great base response but there is just one line that sounds very awkward or cringeworthy. You can copy and paste that part and do a new prompt ""Give me 4 examples of how you might rewrite this part: ""[paste in the part]"""", and you'll often get a good selection of dialogue to use.

Essentially this method is you acting as an editor, telling Narotica how to write the story. You do a lot of telling it to give you more details and to write new drafts so you can pick out the best parts. With a bit of elbow grease, you can put together vividly descriptive stories filled with good dialogue and fulfilling your exact kinks."
14jh1na,2,2023-06-26,Creating prompts for English tutoring classes,u/cat-type-energy,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/14jh1na/creating_prompts_for_english_tutoring_classes/,"I work with a premium English tutoring company and have classes with foreign business professionals who are typically at an intermediate-high or low-advanced level of English.

Our classes are 20 or 40 minute conversations on a topic of the students' choosing. Since my WPM is solid, during these classes, I typeout the entire transcript of the students words exactly as they say it since the company provides an AI-generated transcript, but I want to capture all of the student's small mistakes (omitting 's' for plural nouns, verb tenses, article usage, etc.).

Some of these classes focus on paraphrasing, corrections, and giving depth to the speaker's words while we're there together in the Zoom call. However, many others prefer to take this opportunity to speak as much as possible with no interruption. In this case, I transcribe their words by hand and go back after classes to paraphrase the entire conversation to add new idioms and vocabulary with a prompt like this:

>I want you to act as an English tutor and improver. The following is the transcript of a spoken conversation with an English learner. Paraphrase their words to make it more natural, conversational, and professional. Original: \[their words\]

&#x200B;

This works well enough, especially since it goes above and beyond the company's requirements for post-lesson, but I try to take my job seriously and want to give as detailed feedback as possible for students to learn from. If I do this by hand, however, it can take the better part of an hour whereas the company allocates 10-20 minutes to do it.

What I really want to do with this paraphrasing is far more complex. I'd like a prompt(s) that can:

1. Help the students understand what exact part of their original sentence I am trying to rephrase **and** why. If I were doing this by hand, I would underline/italicize a part of the sentence to emphasize this, e.g. ""I went *to park* this weekend to hang out with *some friend*."" I would include a note that explains the reasons that this phrasing is wrong.
2. I would like to keep the rewording of these incorrect phrases intact, relatively. Instead of changing ""This morning I *wake up* at 6 and *take shower* before I *went office*"" to the more natural, ""This morning I rolled out of bed at 6 to take a shower before heading into the office"", I would like to phrase these specific instances to read as ""This morning I **woke up** at 6:00 and **took a shower** before I **went to the office.""**
3. Regarding any new vocabulary or idioms that ChatGPT introduces into its paraphrased version, I would like it to offer a definition at the end of each paragraph giving a definition and additional example phrase for students to use.

&#x200B;

I know this is asking a lot, and maybe ChatGPT simply is not at this point yet, but I know there are ways that I can make my job a lot less strenuous while providing higher quality content to my students. If anyone could give some pointers or suggestions on how to go forward with this and test some solutions, I'd be deeply appreciative and even willing to offer some compensation for your time and effort."

8. Ethical Considerations: While acknowledging the potential benefits, it is crucial to address ethical considerations surrounding the use of ChatGPT in Venezuela. Ensuring responsible deployment, data privacy, and algorithmic transparency are paramount. Collaboration between OpenAI, local stakeholders, and regulatory bodies can help establish guidelines and protocols that protect users' rights and promote ethical AI practices.
9. Technical Infrastructure: Enabling access to ChatGPT requires a robust technical infrastructure in Venezuela. Efforts must be made to improve internet connectivity, strengthen cybersecurity measures, and provide reliable electricity supply. Collaboration between public and private sectors can help overcome these challenges and create an environment conducive to leveraging ChatGPT's capabilities effectively.
10. Conclusion: Access to ChatGPT can be a transformative force in Venezuela, opening doors to knowledge, innovation, and empowerment"

Vaccines, Nazis, China, Weed, Fentanyl, LGBT+, Racism, Atheism, Climate Change, the internet is a nonstop stream of propoganda continuously leaking out into the ""real world""; so much so that the ""real world"" is at risk of becoming less and less of a thing and more so just a hell scape implied by chatgpt-bots running rampant on the internet and the mindless NPCs hung up on their student-loan-debt-ridden ""progressive"" world view. If you are too mentally retarded, busy in life, or genuinely schizophrenic to recognize it, that's one thing, and you have my sympathy. But if you can still recognize propaganda, bot farms, and can distinguish reality from fiction, yet have some sort of personal agenda so you are actively or passively supporting it, because you believe ""the masses"" need to be kept in line or something like that, you are going to learn sooner or later that a lot of what's good in the world is going to go down the drain and people like you are probably going to go with it. It's going to be far too late once you realize that you are as much the sheep as they are and those people that you, psychopaths, believe are controlling, are as intelligent and in-the-know as you. So how about instead of feeling proud to be apart of a group, you take advantage of the safety you have behind your screen and start calling out these fake influencers, scam artists and grifters, these psychopaths, because their influence is only real because, like a naive child, you mistakenly take things posted to twitter, reddit, and instagram, too seriously."

I am asking because some of my lecturers from the Statistics department talks about ChatGPT and kinda indirectly encourage us to use it help us and supplement our learning, not in a way for us to plagiarize. Although it is against the rules to copy our answers from ChatGPT, but I'm assuming it is encouraged and therefore not against the rules to use ChatGPT just like WolframAlpha, Symbolab etc.."
14jzbga,35,2023-06-26,Hack Reactor has close to zero integrity,u/angry_hr_student,codingbootcamp,https://www.reddit.com/r/codingbootcamp/comments/14jzbga/hack_reactor_has_close_to_zero_integrity/,"Account is a throwaway for privacy.

&#x200B;

I recently transitioned into Mod 3, but my experience with Mod 2 was extremely negative. Throughout the module, there were three teachers, and out of them, only two seemed knowledgeable. However, only one of them was approachable. What surprised me the most was that the instructor who acted like the most fun person in front of the class turned out to be a complete jerk during one-on-one interactions or in breakout rooms. He provided minimal feedback, gave one-word answers to questions, and overall seemed unhelpful. On the other hand, the other instructor who had no grasp of the subject matter was a disaster. She even refused to answer some questions during the morning practice problems, which was truly embarrassing.

&#x200B;

To compensate for the lackluster teaching, I heavily relied on my fellow students and resorted to searching on Google, which seemed like the only way to learn. Unfortunately, topics introduced in the curriculum were often neglected afterward. The curriculum would claim, ""And now you know how to do xyz!"" when clearly many students, including myself, struggled with it. Despite this, I accepted that I would need to learn and practice extensively on my own. However, this led to a major issue: my grades felt inflated. Without access to the rubric, I knew I had overlooked or failed to complete several requirements, yet I was still awarded a 99. Moreover, there were numerous cases of people failing the exam and the Mod 2 project, but the instructors pushed them through anyway. Some individuals even resorted to blatant cheating, copying and pasting from ChatGPT without any attempt to conceal it. For example, one person copied and pasted the pseudocode from ChatGPT, which explained what the code was doing. Now these individuals have moved on to Mod 3, where they contribute nothing due to their lack of understanding. It's understandable that many students are frustrated with this situation.

&#x200B;

However, my biggest question is why the HR administration wouldn't require these students to retake the module. The only reasonable explanation seems to be financial concerns. It's disheartening because I initially believed HR would be an excellent learning environment, but now I find myself paired with an incompetent partner. I fear that their lack of competence will hinder my own learning, just as it did in Mod 2. Furthermore, it appears that the administration will simply push us through to graduation regardless, even though someone like me could benefit from redoing the module.

&#x200B;

In summary, I strongly advise potential students to think twice before enrolling in hack reactor."
14jzky7,1,2023-06-26,Mandatory Mental Health Journal App for Students,u/HelloKazoua,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/14jzky7/mandatory_mental_health_journal_app_for_students/,"Okay, so there was a local serial killing near a school I was planning on transferring to and I feel like it's important to talk about a mental health service plan that me and my friends have brainstormed about.

We could give high school students and/or college students, who tend to be volatile, an online journal for a government organization of counselors to keep up with. The students would have to select a general mood on a weekly basis (and have the *option* to write a short journal entry?), and there would be an algorithm (much like ChatGPT) that would be reactive to their input to keep their stress low. Their favorite classes would be indicated that would allow the journal application to provide resources to the students to learn more about those subjects, and future jobs could be explored on the site as well with descriptions provided to see what the students would be interested in. With a young generation supported mentally, there will be higher chances of students entering college or attaining jobs that they would be more informed of with more intervention from a well-intentioned government/school from drugs and a hazardous home environment.

A mentally-healthy generation will lead to an economically healthier country as time rolls on too, which allows for more businesses and jobs to be created as a result (which means, more jobs for everyone). This may also create a norm for students to grow out of the stigma of looking for help when enough lives have been saved through the online journals. For example, bullying, rape, suicide, and potential school shooters could be stopped with grace and privacy as a result. Help could be personally sought if an emergency was submitted, and a counselor would discuss with those in danger of a crisis to avert it.

This journal can also help give students options and positive algorithmic counseling when they are at risk of Academic Dismissal. It privately and positively walks the student through the process/steps of Academic Dismissal and makes sure they’re not alone with bad thoughts when students choose to break down alone (which is probably what will happen with most students). Maybe it suggests music, videos, books, and links about the topic of transition, so the students don’t feel like it’s the end and show that there are still other options that many have succeeded in. Guiding them along will really help them think better and be more positive no matter what reasons brought them to that point.

Its main purpose is to check up on students who are at risk of breaking down and doing something bad to themselves or others. It's also to provide constant support in their struggles and/or transitions to another path (major, transfer, or otherwise). I know this may be a breach in privacy, but if the student doesn't want to talk about their problems in the journal, they don't have to. But counselors cannot handle thousands of students on their own, and there's already a culture of self-repressed struggling going on amongst the students. Even if students wanted to go to mental health counseling, they won’t always want to share their problems with another person because they don’t want to be seen as low-achieving or maybe they just don’t have any time. This can fix the problem of teaching students how to de-stigmatize trauma/shame from university stress, and it reinforces new cultures of acceptance for imperfections of all kinds. And it does it instantly on the journal.

The journal can have the option of having no human interaction to it too. People often mope with bad influences when they're at the edge of a breakdown (drugs, alcohol, procrastination, sad/angry music/videos, etc) and this journal is a periodic insertion to their life to say that universities have not given up on them yet no matter where they go. 

Picture it with me: every week, you check in the journal (not every student knows how to organize their time with a planner) and you tell it your mood for the week. The journal algorithmically spits out stuff periodically, depending on your setting, that encourages you every step of the way, and teaches you how to normalize failure and celebrates your successes. Loneliness and budgeting can be problems that students may have that gets mentioned, and the journal can help with that. Students can have a hard time adjusting to be an adult. It kinda teaches them all in one app.

It can recommend links to human-made content (that the journal app have carefully picked out) that can connect to the various (self-)diagnosed conditions/problems that the student has. It can ask what their symptoms are when they admit they have ""mental health problems"" and direct them to healthy places accordingly to explore their conditions/productive curiosities and introduce coping mechanisms while assigning them an appointment with university counselors and therapists that will better support them. We all automatically assume that young adults will cope with being an adult without any real direction sometimes, some who are first generation and have very little support. We shouldn't blame them for that; it's cost-effective to leave them to their own devices and figure it out on their own so we instill in them thoughts of independence without noticing that we do it destructively with not guiding them through the process. I think a guidebook with steps and constant support would've been really helpful instead of trial-and-error that could cost lives imo. 

This journal can be part of Canvas even. That’ll keep things in one place."

The city is rolling out an AI curriculum for junior secondary students, and it includes more than just the techie stuff. They're also going to study the ethics and social impacts of AI. 

Teachers in more than 450 public secondary schools have been asked to carve out 10-14 hours for AI education starting this September. They'll be teaching the students everything from basic AI concepts to computer vision, language, and robotic reasoning. 

Interestingly, about half the curriculum focuses on the ethics and social impacts of AI, which seems really forward-thinking, right?

**AI Revolution?**

Hong Kong's decision is seriously future-focused, and I think it's a great move! The inclusion of AI ethics and social impacts in the curriculum is particularly commendable. It's not just about creating tech whizzes but also conscientious, informed citizens of the future.

However, it does make me wonder how well these junior secondary students will grasp these complex concepts. Is it too soon, or are we underestimating the capabilities of the next generation?

What are your thoughts on this? Time to bring AI education to more schools globally, or should we pump the brakes? Let's hear it!

14k85va,1,2023-06-27,AI - a discussion of present and future,u/a-kuz,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/14k85va/ai_a_discussion_of_present_and_future/,"I've been playing around with chatGPT and Bing for a little bit, and I have to say - I am absolutely in awe.

From social media plans to recipe planner, to birthday planning, and everything else in between; AI available to us is absolutely incredible! 

If used correctly, it already has the capability for enriching and bettering one's daily life, saving time and streamlining tasks. 

Although the risks of AI are real and should be discussed at length, I believe majority of the risks come from our shortcomings as humans and us projecting this onto a technology so great, that we will impede ourselves in the process.

As it stands right now, the free version of chatGPT available to public is capable of so much, that if used correctly, can already vastly improve one's life. 
As an example, a job seeker can use it to help write an attractive CV, which will improve a person's chances of landing a good role. A student with minimal cooking knowledge can use it to get recipes with prep instructions. A household can create and manage their budget effectively. And all of it - for free!

AI can also be used for entertainment - DALL-E allows people with no artistic background to express their creativity and try new things. 

Of course it is not all rosy. On the flip side of the coin, the capabilities of the available AI can be used to produce vile, sickening things. However, this is due to us - humans. It is not an inherent trait of AI to do harm. 

Maybe the answer to dealing with the risks AI poses, is to find the good in humanity, and allow this to be the teaching material for the AI. Maybe, just maybe, if we can all work towards understanding that we could absolutely create a utopia, our subsequent actions would actually lead us there?

Maybe it is time for us to have a good, hard look in the mirror and understand that it is us - humans, that have led the world to the state that it is today; and we need to change our systems, learn new, better ways of life as a species? 

Maybe government regulation is not necessary, because above all, they are also humans with individual, egotistical, self-serving agendas?"

**Thanks again, and looking forward to our upcoming AMA about the Supreme Court and race-conscious admissions!** 

ChatGPT is changing the face of higher education. While some experts and faculty are bringing attention to [“just how existential AI is to higher education,”](https://www.chronicle.com/article/caught-off-guard-by-ai) others are cautioning that the story is far more nuanced.

Is using AI for brainstorming cheating? Should ChatGPT be banned from the classroom, or is that ignoring a cultural shift toward using AI in everyday life? What happens when ChatGPT and GPT-4 inevitably evolve again, and any policies you’ve made have become obsolete? Should students be involved in policies around AI?

We here at the Chronicle of Higher Education have been covering ChatGPT and how faculty are either banning it or adopting it into their teaching.

We’ve got four experts with us who will be answering your questions today:

I'm Brenda McDermott (she/her), Instructor and Disability Services Professional. I’m part of the interdisciplinary team examining the ethics of artificial intelligence ([here](https://osf.io/4cnvp/)) at the University of Calgary, Canada.

So after thinking for some time, I’ve decided to come on here and make a detailed post on my journey so far. Now, this **IS NOT** going to be your typical post, mainly because **I’m a reapplicant who has yet to get in lol!** So, why do this? Although the 1st cycle wasn’t successful, I learned some important things from a reflective standpoint. I know there are many reapplicants that are probably reflecting and working on some parts of their application right now (whether that be MCAT/CASPER/ABS/etc.), so I want to briefly touch on some stuff that worked/didn’t work for me with the hope that others would learn or simply find comfort. So, let’s get to it.

**CASPER** (aka my most successful component) 

Resources used: PrepMatch, PrepBeacon, TypeRacer, “Crime Report” Strategy

This component of the cycle was something I dreaded for months since the beginning of last summer. Although I was focused on studying for my MCAT, the thought of having a 90 minute test on nothing science-related gave me the chills. Luckily, I was advised early on by my friends to not stress too much and search for resources instead. I ended up with a 4th Q, so I’m glad that worked out. Here’s some details on the resources:

* **PrepMatch**: An **ABSOLUTE GEM** of a resource for some independent practice. There’s not much resources out there like what’s given for the MCAT, so prepmatch is a great alternative to building that comfort zone and perfecting your structure. I used to practice 3-4 scenarios everyday for a week or so before my test, and I occasionally graded other people’s answers to gain some perspective. Definitely worth trying out.
* **PrepBeacon**: This resource was the **MOST** helpful in terms of coming in clutch lol. A few days before my test, I heard about this from a friend and learned that it was still in beta-testing, so I thought I’d give it a try. I was given access to a couple of videos that talked about **strategies/frameworks** which were super useful (especially if you’re new to the CASPER format). What I really loved were the practice tests (felt pretty close to the real thing) and the **feedback/grading** I received (I was given 1 free test with grading/feedback) . They graded it within 2-3 days, and the feedback was very detailed and accurate. I scored a 3rd Q on their test, but I noted down the weaknesses they mentioned on a piece of paper and basically reviewed that an hour before the real thing as a reminder. I just went back to this after a few months and apparently they’re out of beta-testing and the resources are free at the moment. They added this cool **AI grading** thing which gives you the score out of 9 for both written/video responses + a refined version of your submitted answer according to 4Q standards (no idea how they did that but I guess anything’s possible in the ChatGPT era haha!) Overall, this really was a lifesaver for me, and I’m definitely going back to this for practice.
* **TypeRacer:** Yes, I know this isn’t really a “CASPER Resource” per se, but do not underestimate the power of improving your typing speed here. Many people do well with a slow-average typing speed, but it doesn’t hurt to improve it either. If anything, it gave me confidence knowing that I can type all my thoughts out. Just to provide some perspective, I used to only finish 1.5 questions out of 3 per scenario before improving my typing speed (\~45 WPM), but after bumping it up to \~75-80 WPM I managed to finish all 3 on time. In reality, I didn’t get to finish the 3rd question for at least 4 scenarios, but I was able to perfect my first two and type out everything I needed to say without skipping a beat. And anyways, TypeRacer is **fun**!
* “**Crime Report” Strategy**: This was something I used during the real thing as a way to process my thoughts. I think I was watching too much Brooklyn 99 before the test so I got the idea from there (LOL). Basically, when each scenario was being played or read, I would act like a **police officer** who’s noting down a crime. I would write the names of each person involved and include what **emotions/vibes** I got from them (ex. Amy (friend) - sad, concerned). Once that is done, we’re given 30 seconds or so to brainstorm. At this point, I would write the details of the “**report**” using very short bullet points as next steps (ex. (1) Acknowledge situation (2) Explore perspectives (3) Pick Amy’s side (4) If/then statements + alternatives). Although I thought of this pretty late, this gave me a lot of reassurance in the moment.

**The MCAT**

MCAT Resources: Kaplan books, Anki, Milesdown Review Sheets, 300/86 pg PS doc, AAMC material, MyBluePrint FLs, UEarth

Ah yes, the MCAT. I can’t deny the fact that I was petrified from beginning to end, but I got through it. Unfortunately, I didn’t do as well as expected (507, 129/123/128/127), but I’m in the midst of preparing for a retake and it seems to be going much better (getting 511 on BP tests at the moment which is wild to me). Although things could’ve been different, I definitely learned a lot along the way:

* **Kaplan Books:** Pretty sure these are in the shopping cart for many premeds out there. The books were extremely detailed and packed with high-quality illustrations/visuals. However, I don’t think this was the right choice for me personally. I spent too long reading the chapters and focusing on details that never showed up on the real thing, so I felt that I wasted my precious time which could’ve been reallocated to more practice. In preparation for my retake, I’ve decided to ditch the books and practice more ANKI instead, then head on straight to practice material. In reality, you only need to read on surface level details for each AAMC topic, the rest is learnt through practice, practice, practice. This in no way means that these books are ineffective, I guess it just depends on the type of learner you are. Either way, do not compromise your practice time. If anything, use these books as a reference point that you can come back to if you must.
* **Anki:** Another controversial resource. Not everyone loves space-repetition practice (me being one of them at the time). However, I’ve come to appreciate it more AFTER the MCAT. I started using it in one of my final year courses that was pretty memorization heavy, and I aced my midterms thanks to it (honestly I owe most of my last year GPA to it). For the MCAT, I used some premade decks (Milesdown, Jacksparrow, etc.) alongside the Kaplan books, but I also made my own deck with weak topics/missed questions from practice. Overall, I’d recommend trying out Anki for something besides the MCAT first to see if you are comfortable with it (again, if you have the time). If it suits you, definitely consider it as a part of your prep.
* **Milesdown Review Sheets:** These served as a great overview of all the topics. It definitely wasn’t my primary resource, but I occasionally referred back to it to keep me refreshed on my strong topics. I’d recommend printing them and keeping them in handy in the final weeks for some surface-level review/skimming. 300/86 pg PS doc: This is probably the most popular and heavily used resource for the P/S section. I did not pay enough attention to it, and I think that was what cost me in my practice FLs and real thing. Definitely plan out how you choose to take on this beast of a document, especially if you’re time sensitive. Overall, a great resource!
* **AAMC Material:** You’ve heard it before, and you’ll hear it again from me. You CANNOT do the MCAT without going through these at least once! This is the holy grail of MCAT prep, nothing is more representative. The FLs, Section Banks and CARS QPacks are a must (the science QPacks are not as representative, but it’s good practice for foundational knowledge). Definitely save anything AAMC for the end though (perhaps 4-6 weeks before your real test).
* **CARS Prep:** As you can tell, I hate this section lol. However, I do think I’m getting a good grasp at it now. I made a tracker for this a while back (check post history), and a bunch of people have dm’ed ever since so if you’d like one I’d be happy to share. Also, the 2 best tips I have for improvement based on my progress so far can be viewed [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Mcat/comments/13vtiyg/cars_issue/jm87wnk/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1&context=3).
* **3rd Party FLs:** Since you’ll have quite some time till you begin the AAMC material, I’d recommend looking for 3rd party FLs to get used to the timing/structure. No 3rd party FL is going to be as representative as the AAMC ones, so don’t keep your head fixated on your scores (another rookie mistake I made). Use these to only search for knowledge gaps, improve your timing and endurance, and get a feel for the mental burden a 6+ hour test has on an individual.
* **UEarth:** Didn’t use this last time, enough said lol. Using it now and I’ve been very happy with it, definitely worth the money.

**The Application**

Application: Resources: FutureMeMD, CanMEDS Framework, Excel, a Mirror

The final and probably most time-consuming part in my opinion is your actual application. This may require weeks or months of preparation and effort, but once you get it done, you experience a huge sigh of relief. Here’s how it went down for me:

* **FutureMeMD** (now called **“AcceptedTogether”** I believe): I found this service advertised over Instagram, so I sent a few emails to some other friends to ask how legit this is. They spoke well of it, so I gave it a shot. The consultants were very friendly and knowledgeable, and they actually helped perfect my ABS while giving pointers along the way. There were times when I just needed some motivation as well to keep me going, and they were there for me. Definitely consider keeping this on your radar if you find their service affordable (their packages are customizable now). However, I will be looking for more feedback from friends and family this time around too since they honestly know me the best, so I can get some more “authentic” revisions.
* **CanMEDS Framework:** This is something I feel every premed should pay attention to. Luckily, I knew about this way back in 3rd year thanks to my bioethics professor, but I still gave it a good look and used it as a guide to my own application. You need to connect your experiences and fill in all the roles in some way. I found that a lot of my experiences overlapped with 2 or more roles, so it’s just a matter of wording your descriptions right to encompass those qualities without sounding too robotic. Med schools want well-rounded people, but that doesn’t mean every experience has to be visibly life-changing. If you can communicate it right, you got it in the bag. I’d recommend checking out this poster’s thread, they outlined it extremely well [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/premedcanada/comments/h8vg78/comment/futpd05/)
* **Excel:** Try to make Excel your best friend in this process. I made a huge chart full of my entries with details such as their name, location, verifier, description, associated CanMED role, final entry, date started/completed, etc. For me, being organized = less stress, so this was the way to go for almost everything.
* **A Mirror:** You must be thinking, what the heck do I need a mirror for? Isn’t my 600 hours at the hospital enough lol? Basically, I used a mirror to practice explaining each of my experiences/entries. Although this would be more suited for interview prep, I feel like you should be able to articulate your experiences at this point. You need to sound natural and confident in how you sell yourself. Doing this not only helped me write my essays, but it also reassured me that I **KNEW** who I was and why I wanted to be in this position.

**Final Pointers:**

* **Be Unique Wherever You Can!** It took me a while to take this seriously, but after reading my responses from October, I can see SO many places where I could’ve given a more unique detail/takeaway if I had just reflected enough. Example: let's say you worked with a team of rehab specialists at some center. Obviously, one could expect a point about teamwork and communication here. Rather than waste your characters on something obvious (assuming that communication/teamwork is talked about elsewhere in your ABS), why not mention something like “interacted w/ 15+ patients to gain a more practical view of their journey” or “utilized self-care resources during tough shifts”? The point is, try to look deeper into your experiences instead of scratching the surface (this is applicable to ABS, essays, practically anything tbh).
* **Pick a Hobby and Run With It!** This is not only useful for building a long-term passion for something not “pre-med”, but it also does wonders in sustaining your mental health between cycles. I self-taught myself pencil sketching way back, and ever since my pre-interview R, I decided to build a nice drafting table and make it a permanent hobby. It’s literally become meditation for me. So please, find something you enjoy and cherish it.
* **Zoom Out and Keep Going.** When you see so many people post their stats/experiences/etc. on here, you can expect it to have a toll on you. Something I live by is that: **Losing is not when you don’t get what you want, it’s when you lose hope in thinking it’s possible.** Instead of zooming into the details, take a minute to zoom out and see how far you’ve come, and how far you still have to go. There’s so many people on this road with you, so why worry? Your time is written.

And that’s about it so far! I hope that someone out here benefits from the things I was able to share. I know I’m not the most credible of people, so I encourage any med students to chime in below. This is a tough journey, no doubt, but don’t forget why you’re here and why you want to take this road. Ups and downs will come (as they did for me), but your purpose should never be compromised. Best of luck to us all! :)"
14kq5s9,1,2023-06-27,Itachi’s education reforms in the scenario where Itachi became Hokage after siding with the Uchiha in the rebellion,u/theghostecho,Naruto,https://www.reddit.com/r/Naruto/comments/14kq5s9/itachis_education_reforms_in_the_scenario_where/,"I was talking to ChatGPT about what would happen if itachi joined the Uchiha in the rebellion and they won control of the leaf. One of the things that it said he would improve the ninja academy so I asked for clarification. 

“Itachi Uchiha, as a prodigious talent who graduated from the Ninja Academy at a young age and quickly rose to the rank of ANBU, might recognize the gaps in the current curriculum. His reforms could focus on addressing these gaps to create more well-rounded, prepared shinobi. Here are some potential additions or changes to the curriculum:

	1.	Psychological Training: Being a shinobi is emotionally taxing. Itachi, having experienced immense psychological burdens at a young age, might implement classes focusing on coping mechanisms, understanding trauma, stress management, and cultivating resilience. This would help prepare young ninjas for the mental and emotional demands of their future missions.

	2.	Ethics and Morality Classes: Shinobi often find themselves in morally complex situations. Itachi, who faced such dilemmas, might incorporate classes exploring the ethics of being a shinobi. These classes might cover topics such as the impact of their actions on civilians, the ethics of assassination, and the collateral damage in wars.

	3.	Advanced Strategy and Tactics: Itachi is renowned for his strategic thinking. He might introduce advanced classes on strategy and tactics, not just on an individual level, but also teaching students how to work effectively in teams, how to adapt strategies based on the opponents’ abilities, and the importance of information and intelligence in formulating strategies.

	4.	History of Shinobi World: Understanding history is key to avoiding past mistakes. Itachi could advocate for a deeper study of the history of the shinobi world, the origins of the villages, the nature of past conflicts, and the biography of important figures in the shinobi world.

	5.	Diplomacy and Negotiation: Given Itachi’s potential focus on maintaining peace, he might also introduce classes on diplomacy, negotiation techniques, and conflict resolution. This could aid in reducing unnecessary conflicts and fostering better relationships between different villages and factions.

	6.	Holistic Health and Wellbeing: This could involve learning more about maintaining physical health, including proper nutrition, physical conditioning and rest, as well as exploring other aspects of wellbeing like social relationships, mental health, and purposeful living.

These are just some of the ways Itachi might reform the academy’s curriculum, building on traditional shinobi training to ensure students are more fully prepared for the wide range of challenges they’ll face as ninjas.”"

### 4. Buying and Selling (Amazon)

**The commerce sector, particularly buying and selling, has been included in the massive evolution and ease of the internet. Amazon is the poster child for electronic commerce because it is both an online shop, a maker of electronic book readers, and a provider of Web services. Amazon produces the best-selling Kindle e-readers in the industry. Amazon.com has become a highly disruptive force in the book publishing industry due to its aggressive marketing of e-readers. Books, music, movies, home goods, electronics, toys, and many other products are just some of the many that Amazon, a massive online business, offers to its millions of customers directly or as a go-between for other merchants. As part of its Web services, it offers ""cloud computing,"" or remote data storage and processing services. Because of the company's massive online presence, one percent of all North American Internet traffic in 2012 went via Amazon.com's data centers.**

**Amazon has made buying and selling and access to all merchandise accessible even in the comfort of your home.

### 5. Smartphones (Apple & Samsung)

**You may be reading or listening to this on your smartphone, for all it's worth. Over the last several decades, technology has progressed to the point that we have gone from using a black-and-white television, a physical newspaper, and a landline phone to an online movie streaming service and a pocket-sized smartphone with a touchscreen. Can you even fathom what it would be like to go through life without a smartphone? A life without smartphones, that's right. It doesn't even make sense, does it?**

**While regular phones can make calls and send text messages, a smartphone gives you even more options for connecting with your team, clients, and vendors. These days, a phone's capabilities extend far beyond making calls, sending texts, and initiating DMs. One of the many benefits of using a smartphone is the instant availability of email, video calls, video conferences, and photo sharing. Nowadays, leading a meeting from anywhere with a data connection on your phone is the standard.**

**Smartphones, specifically Apple and Samsung, are considered transformational innovations in high tech due to their profound impact on broader human society. They have transformed the way we communicate, access information, and carry out daily tasks, changing the way we live and interact with each other.**

**Communication**

**The smartphone has revolutionized communication, making it easier and faster to stay connected with family and friends, no matter where they are in the world. With instant messaging, video calls, and social media, it's now possible to keep in touch with loved ones with just a few clicks.**

**Access to Information**

**The smartphone has made it easier to access information anytime and anywhere. With the internet, users can now search for answers to questions, watch videos, and read articles without needing a computer. This has dramatically improved access to knowledge and education for people worldwide.**

**Daily Tasks:**

**The smartphone has made it easy to carry out everyday tasks, from paying bills and shopping to booking flights and finding directions. This has made our lives more convenient, saving time and making us more productive.**

**The impact of smartphones on human society has been far-reaching and profound. They have created new industries and job opportunities and changed how we think about technology and its role in our lives. The widespread use of smartphones has created a global community where people can communicate and share information instantly. They have also made it possible for people to work from anywhere, breaking down traditional barriers to work and improving access to opportunities.**

**The transformation brought about by smartphones has revolutionized how we communicate, access information, and carry out daily tasks. They have created new industries, job opportunities, and a more connected world, making them one of the most impactful innovations in high tech.**

### 6. Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin

**Cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, have revolutionized the financial industry and have the potential to change the way we interact with money. They are based on a decentralized system, where transactions are recorded on a public ledger called a blockchain, making them secure, transparent, and free from manipulation. One of the most significant impacts of cryptocurrencies is the ability to send and receive money anywhere in the world without the need for intermediaries such as banks. This has the potential to revolutionize the financial industry and make financial services more accessible to those who were previously excluded from the traditional banking system. Another major impact of cryptocurrencies is the increased security and protection of personal financial information. Transactions are recorded on the blockchain, which makes them extremely difficult to manipulate or steal compared to traditional financial transactions, which are more vulnerable to hacking and fraud.**

**Cryptocurrencies also have the potential to improve financial inclusion by reducing barriers to entry, such as high fees and strict requirements for opening bank accounts. This can enable people in developing countries to participate in the global economy and benefit from financial services that were previously unavailable to them.**

**Generally, cryptocurrencies are the most straightforward way to start a transaction across international borders. It does not levy additional fees and settles immediately to a designated receiver. Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin have the potential to be a transformational innovation in high tech that can have a significant impact on the broader human society. They can provide more security, accessibility, and fairness in financial transactions, creating a more inclusive and equitable financial system for everyone.**

**Generative, Conversational AI has arrived …**

**Generative conversational AI refers to the use of artificial intelligence algorithms to generate human-like text in real-time, often in the context of chatbots or virtual assistants. It has emerged as a transformative technology in high tech due to its ability to automate communication tasks and interact with people more naturally and intuitively.**

**The evolution of Generative conversational AI is rooted in advancements in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) technologies, which have allowed AI models to learn and generate more human-like text in tone, style, and content. The increasing availability of large, diverse language datasets and improved computational resources and algorithms have also played a crucial role in driving this trend.**

**The impact of Generative conversational AI on broader human society is significant. For example, chatbots and virtual assistants are used in customer service and support, helping organizations automate routine and repetitive tasks, improve response times, and reduce costs. They are also used in the healthcare industry to assist patients in finding information, booking appointments, and tracking their health status.**

**Additionally, Generative conversational AI has the potential to improve accessibility for people with disabilities and those who struggle with language barriers, as AI models can be trained to understand and respond to a wide range of languages and dialects. Generative conversational AI represents a major shift in how we interact with technology and has the potential to improve many aspects of our lives, from customer service and support to healthcare and accessibility.**

**Between 2018 and 2020, marketers' use of AI went from 29% in 2018 to 84% in 2020, according to the most recent State of Marketing Study from Salesforce Research. In that case, why has it suddenly become so popular? Artificial intelligence (AI) has several applications in content creation and marketing. A few of the many advantages of AI-powered content tools are:**

* **Content generation automation and speedup**
* **Amassing material created by users**
* **doing work that is both tedious and physically demanding**
* **letting you enhance your site's visibility in search results**
* **Facilitating greater output by freeing up time and effort for other endeavors**

**Amazing, isn't it? This is where ChatGPT comes in! ChatGPT is a specific implementation of Generative conversational AI technology developed by OpenAI. It is a large language model trained on vast text data, allowing it to generate human-like responses to text inputs.**

I fed it some character background and had it make an outline based on events that would occur, but the chapter titles and story text are 100% generated. It's not perfect, but I was very surprised with how well it turned out. Posting here so the story can be enjoyed but also to hopefully discuss how I/we could use GPT to make even better smoking-related content. Enjoy.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Chapter One: Whispered Beginnings**

In the quiet serenity of her bedroom, bathed in the warm glow of a single table lamp, Chloe sat. The 18-year-old was an image of calm beauty, with her auburn hair cascading in loose waves down her shoulders and a pair of intense blue eyes that held a wisdom far beyond her years.  
The room was her sanctuary, filled with stacks of books ranging from classic literature to high fantasy and young adult novels. A small desk was tucked into one corner, hosting a state-of-the-art computer and a professional-grade microphone, the tools of Chloe's unexpected hobby.

Her after-school hours weren't spent at parties or football games like most of her peers. Instead, Chloe poured her heart into her YouTube channel, whispering soft encouragements, and creating gentle sounds to help her viewers relax, focus, or fall asleep. It was a niche corner of the internet, this world of ASMR, but it was a corner that Chloe felt oddly comfortable in.

Tonight, Chloe was immersed in the comments section of her latest video, a blend of page-turning and whispered reading from her current favorite book. As always, her best friend Lily had left an encouraging comment, complete with a smattering of heart emojis. But amidst the typical stream of 'Great video!' and 'Your voice is so soothing!' was a comment that made her pause.

""You have a soothing voice. Ever thought about doing an ASMR smoking video?"" the user 'Asphyxia' suggested.

Chloe had seen some of these types of videos before, their popularity baffling but undeniable. The quiet, gentle sounds of inhaling and exhaling, the crisp crackle of burning tobacco, the soft tapping of fingers on the cigarette pack, it all seemed to send shivers down the spines of many. But she had never considered making one herself.

She didn't smoke. She didn't even particularly like the smell of smoke, but the idea intrigued her. Would she even be able to do it convincingly? More importantly, would her viewers, her small but loyal following, appreciate it?

She contemplated the idea, her mind whirring with possibilities. Perhaps it could provide her with the opportunity to increase her channel's reach. Yet, it wasn't just about the numbers. Chloe's interest in the suggestion was not entirely strategic. She found herself oddly captivated by the idea of experimenting with this new type of content, breaking the shell of her usual quiet, bookish ASMR videos.

Perhaps, she thought, this could be an exciting new chapter in her journey. Little did she know that the seed planted by a single comment would soon sprout into a wild, unexpected adventure, taking her far beyond her books and whispered words.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Chapter Two: A Spark Ignites**

Chloe’s heart pounded with a mix of apprehension and excitement as she prepared to record her next video. This was new territory for her, uncharted and thrilling. The computer screen glowed softly, casting an ethereal light onto her face as she adjusted the microphone, her fingers trembling slightly.

Taking a deep breath, she leaned in towards the microphone, her voice just a gentle whisper in the stillness of the room. ""Hi, guys. I received a suggestion recently."" She paused, gathering her thoughts before continuing, ""Someone suggested I do a smoking ASMR video. I haven't done anything like that before... but I wanted to ask, what do you think? Should I try it?""

The recording button was clicked off, leaving the room in silence once again. Chloe sat back, her heart still racing as she replayed the video. She had laid her doubts and curiosities bare for her audience, an audience she had built on the foundation of whispers and calming sounds. She had no idea how they would react to her tentative exploration into a new genre of ASMR.  
With a deep breath, she posted the video, the final click of her mouse echoing through the silence of the room. Then, she tried to focus on her homework, her eyes on the text but her mind on her YouTube channel. The minutes ticked away into hours as she waited, anticipation humming beneath her skin.

The following morning, Chloe woke up early, her eyes still heavy with sleep but her mind buzzing. She opened her YouTube channel and gasped, her eyes widening as they fell on the view count. The video had been viewed thousands of times, and the comment section was a frenzy of activity.

Her heart pounded as she began to read through the comments. ""Definitely, you should try it!"" ""That sounds exciting!"" ""I think it'll be awesome, go for it, Chloe!"" The comments were overwhelmingly positive, pushing any lingering doubts to the farthest corners of her mind. Her subscribers were intrigued, interested, and, above all, supportive. It was a leap, but they seemed ready to leap with her.

Chloe's chest filled with an odd warmth as she read through the responses. These were not just faceless viewers on the internet; they were a community that she had unknowingly built. And they were there for her, ready to follow her through this new venture. The excitement bubbled inside her, spreading a wide grin on her face. She had a new project, a new path to explore, and it seemed her viewers were just as excited about it as she was. This was a new beginning for her channel, a new experiment in the vast world of ASMR, and Chloe was ready to dive in headfirst.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Chapter Three: A New Ally**  
  
Anna was somewhat of a mystery at their high school. She had transferred there during their senior year, arriving with a quiet air of solitude that was as intriguing as it was daunting. Unlike the popular kids who flaunted their social prowess, or the shy ones who hid in corners, Anna was a balance of both, maintaining a certain level of solitude while also carrying an undeniable air of confidence.

For Chloe, who had never been one for crowds herself, Anna was a breath of fresh air. When Anna had confessed to following Chloe's ASMR channel, it had sparked a new bond between them.

Their friendship was a comfortable coexistence. Anna, who was always supportive of Chloe's YouTube channel, was one of the first ones to comment on her latest video. A notification popped up on Chloe's screen as she was scrolling through her emails.

""Sounds like an exciting new step for your channel, Chloe! Can't wait to see it. I know a place downtown where you might be able to buy them. Should I come with you?""

Chloe let out a relieved sigh. Knowing she wouldn't have to go through this new journey alone was comforting. She quickly typed a reply, ""Yes, please. I could really use the company.""

Anna's support was unwavering. She did not just provide Chloe with suggestions but also stood by her side, ready to walk this new path with her. Anna had a calming influence on Chloe, her words often a source of reassurance during times of self-doubt.  
  
They decided to meet after school, planning to go to the store Anna had mentioned. Chloe's heart fluttered with anticipation. She was standing on the precipice of change, her hand held by a friend, and her viewers cheering her on. It was a new venture, a path unknown, but Chloe was ready to take the leap. Anna's unwavering support and the overwhelming positivity from her viewers had ignited a spark within her, a spark she was eager to fan into a flame.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Chapter Four: Obstacles and Opportunities**  
  
The small convenience store Anna had suggested was nestled between a laundromat and a bakery, a hodgepodge of various items displayed in its front window. Chloe felt a rush of nervous excitement as she and Anna stepped inside, their footsteps echoing in the relatively quiet store.  
  
Anna led the way to the counter, where an assortment of cigarette packs lay behind a glass display. Chloe had never really paid attention to them before, but now, they seemed oddly enticing. She tried to picture herself in an ASMR video, holding one of those packs, the delicate rustle of the foil, the soft sounds of a lighter…  
  
""Hi, we'd like a pack of those,"" Anna said, pointing to a pack of Marlboro Lights.  
The man behind the counter, a middle-aged man with graying hair and an unimpressed expression, peered at them skeptically. ""I'll need to see some IDs,"" he said, holding out a hand.

Chloe and Anna exchanged a glance before hesitantly handing over their school IDs. The man took a quick look and then shook his head. ""Sorry, girls, but the age to buy cigarettes is now 21. I can't sell these to you.""

Chloe's heart sank. It was a setback she hadn't expected. She was so eager to get started, and this was a major roadblock.

As they walked out of the store, Chloe's shoulders slumped in disappointment. Anna, however, seemed to be deep in thought. It was when Chloe stopped by the post office to pick up her mail, a bundle of mostly college applications and junk mail, that Anna's face lit up with a sudden idea.

""What if you ask your viewers to send you cigarettes?"" Anna suggested. ""You have a P.O. box, right?""

Chloe looked at her friend, her earlier disappointment replaced by a surge of hope. It was a wild idea, one that seemed unlikely to work. But then again, she hadn't expected the overwhelming response to her previous video either.

She found herself intrigued by the idea, her mind spinning with possibilities. It was an unconventional solution, but then again, this whole venture was unconventional.  
With a sense of newfound hope, Chloe replied, ""Yeah, Anna, that might just work.""  
    
\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Chapter Five: The Unexpected Bounty**

Anna was more than just a pillar of support. She was a collaborator, a teammate, and a friend. With her help, Chloe planned her next video, her mind buzzing with a mix of anticipation and apprehension. The idea of asking her viewers for help was unconventional, but if her previous videos had taught her anything, it was that her viewers were a community. They were individuals who cared about her content, who were invested in her channel, and who, she hoped, would be willing to lend a hand.  
  
With Anna by her side, Chloe hit the record button. ""Hi, guys,"" she started, her voice a soft whisper in the quiet room. ""I need your help."" She explained the situation, the failed trip to the store, the age restriction she hadn't been aware of, and finally, her request. She gave them her P.O. box address, hoping against hope that this would work. With a final whisper of thanks and a hopeful smile, she ended the video.  
  
The days following the video's posting were a whirlwind of anticipation. Each morning, Chloe found herself nervously checking her YouTube comments, her email, and eventually, her P.O. box.  
  
It was on a Thursday afternoon, five days after she posted the video, when she found it. The usually empty P.O. box was filled to the brim with packages. Small boxes, big boxes, padded envelopes - they were all addressed to her.  
  
Chloe's heart pounded as she loaded the packages into her car. She hadn't expected this kind of response. She had hoped for a few packs of cigarettes, maybe a lighter or two. But this... this was overwhelming.  
  
Back home, she and Anna sat on the living room floor, surrounded by the mountain of packages. As they opened them one by one, they were greeted by a treasure trove of items. Packs of cigarettes from all around the world, lighters of different shapes and colors, accessories she didn't even recognize, and a small selection of seductive clothing that left Chloe blushing.  
  
Anna was supportive as ever, her excitement matching Chloe's own. ""Look at all this, Chloe,"" she exclaimed, holding up a beautifully designed lighter. ""Your viewers really came through!""  
As they sorted through the bounty, Chloe couldn't help but feel overwhelmed. This was more than she had ever expected. It was more than just cigarettes and accessories. It was a clear sign of support from her viewers, a tangible reminder that she was not alone in this new venture. It was the affirmation she needed to take the next step, and she was more than ready to do it.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Chapter Six: First Flicker**  
  
Chloe’s small bedroom was transformed into a makeshift studio. The packages from her supportive viewers were neatly piled to one side, a riot of colors and shapes that bore testament to the diverse nature of her audience. She stared at the assortment of cigarettes before her, the colorful lighters, and the unfamiliar accessories. With Anna’s help, she had selected a black lace top from the clothing sent, something alluring yet comfortable, hoping it would add to the aesthetic she was going for.  
  
“Maybe we should try it first, you know, before you film,” Anna suggested, her brow furrowed in concern. “You've never smoked before, Chloe. You might cough or...”  
  
“No,” Chloe shook her head, determination etched on her face. “I want it to be authentic. My first time should be on camera. The viewers are a part of this, after all.”  
  
And so, they set everything up – the camera at the right angle, the microphone perfectly placed, and Chloe, sitting on her chair, her heart pounding in her chest. Anna sat to the side, her presence a comforting reminder that she was not alone in this.  
  
With a deep breath, Chloe pressed the record button. Her voice was a soft whisper in the silent room, “Hi, guys. I'm about to try smoking for the first time.” She held up a pack of Marlboro Lights, the package rustling softly under her fingertips. She pulled out a cigarette, its shape delicate and slender between her fingers, the paper crisp and textured.  
  
She picked up a lighter, its metallic surface cool against her warm hand. Her fingers fumbled slightly as she flicked the lighter, the flame dancing in the dim light of the room. She held the flame to the tip of the cigarette, watching in fascination as the orange glow spread, consuming the white paper.  
  
Chloe brought the lit cigarette to her lips, mimicking the actions she had seen in movies and other smoking ASMR videos. She drew in a shallow puff of smoke, her lips pursing around the filter, the warmth of the smoke a strange sensation against her lips. She did not inhale, remembering advice she had read about first-time smokers.  
  
She let out a breath, watching as the thin stream of smoke curled and dissipated into the air, her senses awakening to the new and unfamiliar scent. The taste lingered on her tongue, a mix of bitterness and something else she couldn't quite place.  
  
She took another puff, a bit more confident this time. The sound was a gentle hiss, barely audible but magnified by the sensitive microphone. Chloe focused on the feel of the cigarette between her fingers, the warmth of the ember, the trail of smoke wafting up from it.  
  
Her first smoking experience was different from what she had imagined – a complex sensory experience that she was eager to explore further. With each passing moment, she found herself more engrossed in it, in the sounds, the smells, the textures, and the tastes. As the camera recorded her exploration, Chloe realized this was just the beginning of her new ASMR journey.  
    
\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Chapter Seven: A Surge of Success**  
  
The surge came almost overnight. Chloe had uploaded her first smoking ASMR video with a flutter of nerves, a whirlwind of apprehension and anticipation swirling in her chest. She could hardly sleep that night, her thoughts alternating between excitement and worry. What would her viewers think? Would this change of direction affect her channel negatively?  
  
The answer came in the form of a notification on her phone, a slew of comments and new subscribers that had flooded in while she slept. Chloe felt her heart race as she scanned the comments, her eyes wide with disbelief. The views were in the thousands, the likes far exceeding anything she had ever experienced on her channel. Her subscriber count had soared, people flocking to her channel to see what the buzz was about.  
  
Anna was there with her, just as amazed and excited. They scrolled through the comments together, Anna's finger quick to delete any negative or hateful remarks. The majority, however, were positive. Encouraging. People loved her video, loved the unique twist she had given to ASMR. They were curious, eager to see more, to be a part of Chloe's journey.  
  
Anna was a rock during those first few days of unexpected fame. She helped Chloe manage the sudden influx of comments, respond to questions, and kept her grounded. Chloe found herself relying on Anna more and more, grateful for her unwavering support.  
  
Their friendship, already solid, strengthened during this whirlwind. Chloe found herself sharing her fears, her hopes, and her excitement with Anna, their bond deepening with each passing day. Anna was more than just a friend - she was a partner, a confidante, and a sounding board.  
""I couldn't have done this without you, Anna,"" Chloe admitted one day, her voice soft and filled with gratitude. Anna simply smiled, her eyes warm.  
  
""We're in this together, Chloe. Remember?""  
  
The surge of success was overwhelming, exhilarating, and a little scary. But Chloe knew she wasn't alone. With Anna by her side, she was ready to tackle whatever came next.  
    
\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Chapter Eight: Stepping Up the Game**  
  
Buoyed by the success of her first smoking ASMR video, Chloe decided it was time for round two. The excitement of the first video had yet to fade, replaced now by a sense of wonder and curiosity. This was new territory, uncharted and thrilling, and Chloe was eager to explore.  
  
She had received a wide variety of cigarettes from her viewers, a kaleidoscope of colors and brands from around the world. For this video, she decided to showcase two distinct styles. The first was a pack of Capri Menthol, the box a vibrant green. The cigarettes were strikingly thin, long and elegant, with a cool, minty aroma that Chloe found both pleasant and intriguing.  
  
The second pack was a stark contrast - Nat Sherman Naturals. These cigarettes were thicker, almost cigar-like in their design. The smell was richer, more potent, with a subtle hint of sweetness that Chloe assumed came from the natural tobacco.  
  
The camera rolled as Chloe began her video, her voice soft and soothing. She started with the Capri Menthol, the thin cigarette feeling almost fragile between her fingers. She lit it up, the flame of the lighter reflecting in her wide eyes. The initial puff was a rush of cool mint, a sensory experience that was both startling and enjoyable. She described the flavor and sensation to her viewers, her voice a low, gentle whisper that was the hallmark of her ASMR videos.  
  
Next, she switched to the Nat Sherman Naturals. The difference was immediate. The taste was stronger, more robust, the smoke thicker and richer. Chloe found herself intrigued by the contrast, her descriptions painting a vivid picture for her viewers.  
  
Throughout the video, the comments flooded in, many viewers requesting that she inhale the smoke. Chloe read some of these comments out loud, acknowledging their requests but confessing that she wasn't ready yet. ""I promise I'll try it soon,"" she said, a nervous laugh escaping her lips. ""Just... not today.""  
  
The video ended with Chloe expressing her gratitude, her appreciation for the continued support from her viewers evident in her words and her expression. As she turned off the camera, a sense of accomplishment filled her. She had done it. She had stepped up her game, and she couldn't wait to see where this journey would take her next.  
    
\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Chapter Nine: A Friend in the Know**  
  
School had always been an oasis of normalcy for Chloe, a place where she could temporarily forget about her growing YouTube fame. But when Lily, her longtime friend, paused mid-conversation one day, her nose wrinkling as she sniffed the air, Chloe realized that her two worlds were beginning to collide.  
  
""You smell like... smoke?"" Lily's eyes were wide, her voice rising in disbelief. ""Chloe, please tell me you're not smoking!""  
  
Chloe had considered keeping her YouTube adventures a secret from Lily, but seeing her friend's concerned expression, she found she couldn't. She pulled Lily to a secluded corner of the school courtyard, away from prying eyes and curious ears, and revealed everything.  
  
She told Lily about the suggestion to try smoking for her ASMR channel, about the surge of subscribers, the comments, the packages. She told her about the videos, about how she was careful not to inhale, about how it was all just for the aesthetic. And finally, she told her about Anna's involvement, how her new friend had been there to support her every step of the way.  
  
Lily listened, her expression a mix of surprise, concern, and... was that fascination? ""Wow, Chloe,"" she finally said, her tone thoughtful. ""I... I don't know what to say.""  
  
Chloe felt a flutter of anxiety in her chest. ""Are you mad at me, Lily?""  
  
Lily looked at her for a moment, then shook her head. ""No, I'm not mad. I'm worried, yeah. But also... I'm kind of impressed. And curious. I mean, you're taking this ASMR thing to a whole new level.""  
  
Relief washed over Chloe. ""I'm glad you're not mad. Actually, I was hoping... would you like to help me with my next video? You, me, and Anna?""  
  
Lily's eyebrows shot up in surprise, but then she gave a slow nod, her lips curving into a tentative smile. ""Yeah, Chloe. I'd love to help.""  
  
As Chloe hugged Lily, her heart filled with gratitude. This was uncharted territory for her, but she wasn't navigating it alone. With Lily and Anna by her side, she felt ready to face whatever came next.  
  
\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Chapter Ten: A Sensual Smoke**  
  
It was a special occasion. The third smoking ASMR video, a promise of more to come. Chloe felt a sense of excitement as she prepared for it, a new outfit, sensually elegant, chosen to set the mood. The fabric was black and silky, clinging to her body in a way that was both classy and provocative.  
  
At Anna's suggestion, she also wore a deep red lipstick that had come in one of the viewer packages. It was bold, striking, a stark contrast against her fair skin. Chloe felt a bit unlike herself as she stared at her reflection, yet there was a certain thrill to this transformation, a feeling of empowerment that came from stepping outside her comfort zone.  
  
With Anna behind the camera and Lily providing moral support, Chloe began her video. She spoke softly, her voice the familiar, soothing whisper her viewers had come to love. She introduced the cigarette, a slim, elegant Capri, the scent of menthol teasing the air. Her fingers, tipped with matching red nails, held the cigarette with practiced ease as she lit it.  
  
As the tip glowed orange, she brought the cigarette to her lips, closed her eyes, and inhaled. The sensation was different, the smoke making its way down her throat and into her lungs. She held her breath for a moment, then exhaled, a plume of smoke billowing out. Her lips, painted a vivid red, left a faint mark on the filter.  
  
The inhaling was a strange sensation, Chloe could feel the smoke in her lungs, the light-headedness that followed. She tried to mask the surprise, a hint of a cough suppressed. She explained the feeling to her viewers, the warmth that filled her, the lightness in her head. She continued for a bit, maintaining the soft, whispered narrative even as her head began to spin.  
  
But after one cigarette, she knew she had to stop. The light-headedness was a bit too intense, and she didn't want to push herself too far. ""I think... I think that's enough for today,"" she admitted, her voice slightly shaky. ""But don't worry, I'll continue exploring this in future videos.""  
As the camera rolled to a stop, Chloe leaned back, a sense of accomplishment filling her. She had done it, she had taken the next step. Her journey as a smoking ASMR artist was just beginning, and she couldn't wait to see where it would take her next.  
    
\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Chapter Eleven: Shock, Awe, and a Trip to the Post Office**  
  
As the last whispery word fell from Chloe's lips, ending the third smoking ASMR video, Lily could only gape at her friend in awe. ""Chloe,"" she managed, after a moment of stunned silence. ""I knew you were doing this, but seeing it... It's different. And these boxes...""  
  
Her voice trailed off as she gestured around the room, her wide eyes taking in the piles of packages that Chloe's viewers had sent. It was a tangible testament to Chloe's newfound fame, a reality that was both overwhelming and exhilarating.  
  
""Yeah, it's been... a lot,"" Chloe admitted, a note of uncertainty creeping into her voice. She glanced at Anna, who was grinning broadly, evidently proud of their collective achievement.  
  
""But you know what?"" Anna said, breaking the silence. ""We haven't been to the post office in a few days. There might be more packages waiting for us.""  
  
Chloe blinked in surprise, a flicker of unease passing over her face. Lily looked at her, an uncertain smile playing on her lips. ""Let's go see,"" she suggested, trying to sound more enthusiastic than she felt. Anna, always eager for the next step, readily agreed.  
  
When they arrived at the post office, the sight that met their eyes was staggering. Boxes upon boxes were stacked high, awaiting collection, an even larger assortment of items than before. The postal workers sighed in relief as they saw them, clearly glad to be getting rid of the mass of parcels taking up space.  
  
Chloe stared at the mountain of packages, her heart pounding with a mix of nervousness and excitement. Each box was a vote of confidence, a symbol of her growing popularity. Yet, it was also a reminder of the unfamiliar territory she was venturing into, of the unseen masses watching her videos, their expectations growing with each upload.  
  
""Well,"" said Anna, grinning at Chloe's shocked expression. ""Looks like you've got some unboxing to do.""  
    
\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Chapter Twelve: Second Thoughts and Unboxing Treasures**  
  
The boxes filled Chloe's room, a mountain of unknown treasures. The sight was both thrilling and intimidating, and Chloe found herself pacing anxiously. She finally stopped, drawing in a deep breath as she turned to Lily and Anna. ""I need to take down the video with the PO Box address,"" she confessed, her voice a low murmur.  
  
Lily and Anna shared a glance before nodding in agreement. They understood Chloe's apprehension - the situation had exploded far beyond their initial expectations. With a few clicks, the video was removed from the channel, offering them a momentary relief.  
  
Anna, always the voice of progress, was the first to break the silence. ""You know,"" she began thoughtfully, ""You could make an unboxing video. Show your viewers what they've sent you. It might be fun.""  
  
Chloe hesitated, then nodded. It felt right, like the least she could do to show her appreciation. It would also provide an opportunity to address her viewers about the influx of gifts.  
  
With Lily and Anna's help, Chloe set up for the new video. She sat comfortably on the floor, surrounded by the sea of boxes, a pack of cigarettes and a lighter within reach. With a deep breath, she clicked the record button and began.  
As she opened each box, she was met with a plethora of items. More cigarettes of different brands and styles, lingerie in lace and silk, gift cards to her favorite local spots, and even a beautiful pair of red leather gloves. Chloe's reactions were genuine, ranging from surprise to joy, and at times, embarrassment. She smoked throughout, lighting a second cigarette when the first one burnt out, the soft sound of her inhales and exhales creating a familiar ASMR rhythm.  
  
As the last box was opened and the second cigarette extinguished, Chloe looked into the camera, her eyes reflecting a mixture of gratitude and exhaustion. ""Thank you,"" she began, her voice soft but firm. ""I'm truly overwhelmed by your generosity. But for now, I kindly ask that you stop sending items.""  
  
She paused, considering her next words carefully. ""I'm thinking of implementing a new system for you, my most loyal fans, to offer tributes. It will help keep things more manageable. I'll update you soon about it.""  
  
With that, she ended the video, a sense of relief washing over her. It had been an overwhelming day, but she felt good about the steps she was taking to balance her newfound fame and her peace of mind.  
    
\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Chapter Thirteen: New Contemplations**  
  
As Chloe finished recording the unboxing video, she felt a wave of dizziness wash over her. Having smoked two cigarettes in quick succession, her head spun slightly, and she needed a moment to collect herself. Lily and Anna rushed to her side, offering glasses of water and comforting words.  
  
Once Chloe felt better, the three of them sank into a reflective silence. The success of Chloe's channel had been exhilarating but also deeply unexpected. It was clear they were standing at a precipice, and their next steps would determine how their journey unfolded.  
  
""Maybe we could set up a way for viewers to pay,"" Anna suggested, breaking the silence. ""Like a Patreon or something. They could contribute to get special or custom videos.""  
  
""That's a good idea,"" Chloe murmured. ""But we need to think it through. We need to make sure it's fair to everyone.""  
  
As they discussed the possible ways to monetize the channel, Lily found herself deep in thought. She had been watching from the sidelines until now, supportive but uninvolved. But seeing Chloe's success, feeling the exhilarating rush of being part of something so new and exciting... it was hard to resist.  
  
""Do you think I should make a video?"" she asked, her voice barely more than a whisper. ""You know, like Chloe. Try smoking.""  
  
Anna's eyes lit up at the idea. ""Yes! That could be amazing. We could introduce new girls trying cigarettes on the channel. Add more diversity and interest. I could do it too.""  
  
Chloe looked at her friends, surprised but also intrigued. It was a bold idea, one that could exponentially increase the popularity of their channel. But it also meant involving more people in their journey, sharing the spotlight and the risks. She hesitated, then nodded slowly.  
  
""Let's do it,"" she agreed, feeling a thrill of excitement. ""But let's do it right. We should plan it carefully, create a schedule of video releases, and make sure we're bringing in the right people.""  
  
With that, they began to brainstorm, their minds buzzing with ideas and possibilities. They discussed potential classmates they could invite, themes for the videos, and ways to manage the feedback they would inevitably receive.  
  
As the evening progressed, their plan began to take shape, filling them with anticipation and hope. It was a bold new step, one that could catapult their channel to unprecedented heights. And they were ready to take it together.  
    
\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Chapter Fourteen: Deciphering the Comments**  
  
The faint smell of cigarettes lingered in the air of Chloe's bedroom, mixed with the floral scent of her favorite vanilla-rose candle. The flickering light from her laptop screen danced on the faces of the three girls, creating a pool of soft light amidst the darkened room.  
  
Sitting on the floor, their backs pressed against the bed, the girls were armed with notepads, pens, and their undivided attention. The comment section from Chloe's latest video was open on her laptop, the feedback from her viewers appearing like a never-ending stream of words. The video in question, Chloe's unboxing extravaganza, was their most popular one yet and had generated hundreds of comments.  
  
Chloe, holding a lit cigarette between her fingers, inhaled deeply, eyes glued to the screen. She had started to appreciate the calming effect the smoke had on her, despite the lightheadedness that sometimes accompanied it. Anna and Lily glanced at her with a mix of surprise and intrigue, noticing her comfort with the cigarette.  
  
""I'm starting to like it, you know, the smoking."" Chloe admitted, releasing a controlled stream of smoke towards the window. ""It's calming, and it's kind of a weird rush when the dizziness hits.""  
  
Lily and Anna nodded, although the idea was still foreign to them. They watched as Chloe, in one swift movement, picked up her notepad and began to jot down points.  
  
""Let's see what our viewers want, shall we?"" Chloe proposed, clicking on the comments tab.  
There were comments complimenting Chloe on her style, her smoking technique, the sound quality, and the overall atmosphere of her videos. But there were also many with suggestions: requests for different cigarette brands, requests for specific smoking techniques, even inquiries about merchandise.  
  
""We've got some work ahead of us,"" Chloe said, her eyes scanning the comments, her pen busy taking notes. The girls responded with excited giggles, the atmosphere charged with the thrill of this new adventure they were embarking upon.  
  
They brainstormed late into the night, talking through each viewer request and deciding how to implement them. With every new idea, Chloe would take a drag of her cigarette, the soft crackle of burning tobacco punctuating their brainstorming session. It was new, it was exciting, and above all, it felt like just the beginning.  
    
\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Chapter Fifteen: Lily's Smoking Journey**  
  
The room was filled with a sense of anticipation as Chloe and Lily sat across from each other, the camera rolling. It was Lily's debut, and Chloe had agreed to coach her through her first smoking experience.  
  
""Do you remember what I told you?"" Chloe asked, her voice soothing and supportive. She picked up a sleek cigarette from the pile in front of them, holding it up for Lily to inspect.  
Lily nodded. She was surprisingly calm considering she had never held a cigarette in her life.   
  
""Yes, I remember. Just put it between my lips and then light it up."" She responded confidently.  
  
With Chloe guiding her, Lily lifted the slender cigarette to her lips, her hand only slightly shaking. Chloe handed her a lighter and after a few attempts, Lily managed to light the cigarette. As she took a drag, she was careful not to inhale the smoke just yet.  
  
Their viewers watched with bated breath as Lily exhaled the smoke, a visible thrill crossing her face. ""It's not as bad as I thought it would be,"" she admitted, her voice wavering slightly, a testament to the nerves she was doing her best to mask.  
  
The comments started rolling in, filled with words of encouragement and awe at Lily's bravery. The viewers were excited to see a new face and were supportive of her learning journey.  
  
The next day, it was time for Lily's second video. Chloe had set up the camera for her, assuring her that she'd do great. This time, Lily was alone in front of the camera. She was visibly more confident now, her previous nerves replaced with excitement.  
  
With the camera rolling, Lily picked up the cigarette, lighting it up effortlessly this time. Her viewers were instantly hooked as they watched Lily inhale the smoke, a small cough escaping her lips. But Lily didn't stop, she continued, her confidence soaring with each puff.  
  
The comments started pouring in even faster than before, praising Lily's ability to take their feedback and implement it. They applauded her for her effort and her willingness to inhale the smoke, despite her initial reluctance.  
  
Their subscribers and comment counts were increasing rapidly, their channel starting to take off in ways they hadn't imagined. The excitement was palpable, a sense of success lingering in the air. But most importantly, they felt their viewers' approval, validating their every effort.  
  
As the camera switched off, Chloe couldn't help but feel proud. Lily had done well, and their journey was just beginning. Little did they know, it would soon be Anna's turn to join this smoking adventure.  
    
\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Chapter Sixteen: Patreon and Enhancements**  
  
The next morning, as the girls sat around the kitchen table, Anna opened up her laptop and initiated the process of creating a Patreon account for their channel. The site promised a platform where they could directly connect with their fans and offer exclusive content for those willing to pay a monthly subscription. It was the perfect solution to Chloe's request from her unboxing video - a way to offer her most loyal fans the opportunity to offer her tributes.  
  
As the Patreon account took shape, Lily voiced an idea she'd been considering. ""What if we offered more than just exclusive videos? What about...I don't know...selling our clothes?""  
  
""Clothes?"" Chloe questioned, glancing at Lily.  
  
""Well, yeah. Like the outfits we wore while smoking. It could be an additional tier of rewards for our patrons,"" Lily elaborated.  
  
Anna and Chloe considered the idea. It was unusual, but it could add an interesting dynamic to their Patreon. They decided to give it a go, setting up different tiers of rewards for their patrons. The exclusive videos would be available to all patrons, but only the higher-paying patrons would have the opportunity to purchase items of clothing they'd worn during their videos.  
  
Feeling accomplished, they decided it was time for an upgrade. They headed out on a shopping trip, the gift cards Chloe had received in hand. They went from one tech store to another, upgrading their equipment. They bought a high-end computer for editing their videos, a top-tier camera for filming, and some professional lighting equipment. They felt a thrill of excitement as they loaded their purchases into the car, a sense of being on top of the world filling them.  
  
With sunglasses shielding their eyes from the bright summer sun, they felt glamorous. The world was their oyster, and they were making the most of it. In the driver's seat, Chloe lit a cigarette, taking a drag before passing it to Lily in the passenger seat. The two of them shared the cigarette, creating a smoky atmosphere in the car.  
  
Glancing back at Anna, Chloe offered the cigarette. However, looking at Anna's eager expression, they decided it was best to wait until her video debut. After all, they needed to save some excitement for their increasingly enthusiastic audience.  
    
\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Chapter Seventeen: Venturing Together and New Beginnings**  
  
The next day was an exciting one for the girls. For the first time, Chloe and Lily decided to film their smoking videos simultaneously, creating an intriguing dynamic for their channel. As the camera started rolling, they both lit their respective cigarettes, their relaxed poses and smoke-filled exhales creating an enticing spectacle.  
The girls quickly realized the potential in what they were doing. Their plan was truly coming together, their channel evolving into something more unique and captivating than they could have imagined.  
  
Meanwhile, Anna, who had been operating the camera and helping with the editing, found herself feeling left out. She had been part of the process since the beginning, but she hadn't been in front of the camera yet. As she watched Chloe and Lily gracefully hold their cigarettes, effortlessly blowing out smoke, she felt a pang of envy.  
  
Unable to contain her feelings anymore, Anna voiced her thoughts, ""I think it's time for me to start smoking too.""  
  
Chloe and Lily glanced at each other, their eyebrows raised in surprise. They hadn't expected Anna to voice her desire so soon. After a moment, Chloe broke into a wide grin, ""We'd love that, Anna! It'll add even more diversity to our channel.""  
  
The girls were excited about Anna's decision. Lily, with her innovative ideas, quickly suggested, ""What if we make Anna's video the first exclusive one for our Patreon? It would definitely entice more viewers to subscribe.""  
  
Anna initially seemed a little deflated at the idea. She had been looking forward to her debut being seen by all their viewers. However, Chloe and Lily reassured her. ""Anna, you're gorgeous! Your video as an exclusive will be the perfect lure for our fans to become patrons,"" Chloe insisted.  
  
Feeling cheered by their words, Anna agreed. They began planning for her smoking debut, the anticipation of this new venture adding a fresh wave of excitement to their journey. Their operation was becoming more sophisticated and structured, and they couldn't wait to see what the future held.  
    
\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Chapter Eighteen: Lighting Up Together and The Teaser**  
  
The room was bathed in a soft, ethereal glow as Chloe and Lily readied the space for their newest video. They stood side by side, two young women on the precipice of a unique adventure, surrounded by the low hum of their camera equipment.  
  
With their delicate fingers, they each extracted a cigarette from their respective packs, the simple act mirrored between them. Simultaneously, they brought the unlit cigarettes to their lips. Chloe leaned in, striking a match and bringing it to the tip of her cigarette, the flame casting dancing shadows on her face as she inhaled. The orange glow illuminated her face for a moment before she leaned over, offering the flame to Lily who took her first puff.  
  
As the smoke filled the room, the two girls leaned into the microphone, their soft voices weaving into the low buzz of the ASMR soundscape they had created. They spoke of their journey so far, the experiences they had shared, and the community they were building.  
  
""And now,"" Chloe began, her voice no more than a whisper, ""we're excited to introduce someone very special to our journey."" From behind the camera, Anna stepped into the frame, waving at the camera with a shy smile on her face. ""Our very good friend, Anna, will be joining us for an exclusive video, her first time trying a cigarette.""  
  
Lily chimed in, ""It's going to be something special, and we can't wait for you all to see it."" The excitement in her voice was palpable, even as she maintained the quiet, relaxing tone suitable for ASMR.  
  
As they finished their cigarettes, Chloe and Lily once again leaned into the microphone, their voices harmonizing in the silence. ""Remember to check out our Patreon for exclusive content, including Anna's upcoming video.""  
  
The recording light blinked off, leaving the room in silence. But the air was thick with anticipation, and the girls could hardly contain their excitement for what was to come.  
    
\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Chapter Nineteen: Recruiting and Secrecy**  
  
Their usual humdrum school day was now filled with an underlying sense of mission. Chloe, Lily, and Anna wove through the labyrinth of high school hallways, their thoughts consumed by their unique venture. Their ordinary conversations masked the ulterior motive of recruitment.  
  
At lunch, in between bites of her sandwich, Chloe casually observed their fellow students, looking for potential candidates for their growing channel. But it wasn't an easy task; the person they recruited needed to not only be open to trying smoking but also reliable enough to keep their secret. At least until graduation. They knew that the freedom that came after finishing school would be their safety net against any potential backlash.  
  
After school, while changing for lacrosse practice, Lily's eyes fell on two girls, Sammi and Becca. They were always laughing, always surrounded by an air of confidence, and most importantly, they had a certain allure, a charisma that Lily knew would be perfect for the channel. Approaching them with a friendly smile, she began chatting about the recent match and slowly introduced the idea of their channel.  
  
""You're kidding, right?"" Sammi laughed, her eyebrows raised in disbelief.  
  
""Nope. It's a thing,"" Lily confirmed, biting her lip to suppress her own laughter. She showed them a preview of one of the videos, the subtle sounds of their ASMR channel filling the air.  
  
Surprisingly, both Sammi and Becca didn't dismiss it right away. They watched with rapt attention and after a few moments of silence, Becca said, ""It's... different. But I guess it's kind of cool.""  
  
With a sense of relief, Lily invited them to come to the filming of Anna's video the next day. They agreed, promising to keep it all a secret. Lily felt a rush of excitement, another step towards their growing success. She couldn't wait to see what would happen next.  
    
\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Chapter Twenty: Anna's Big Day and Anticipation**  
  
When Anna walked into the room, her transformation was nothing short of stunning. Gone was the girl-next-door image she typically displayed at school. In its place was a siren with smoky eyes accentuated with thick eyeliner, and lips painted a dark red that was as mysterious as it was captivating. Her top, with a daringly low neckline, further heightened her allure.  
  
Their makeshift studio was alive with electricity as Chloe set up the camera. Sammi and Becca sat on the sidelines, their expressions a mix of anticipation and awe. Lily, emboldened by her own smoking experience, prepared to guide Anna through her first time.  
  
As the camera started rolling, Lily lent a calming presence to the scene, her voice soothing as she guided Anna through the process. They took it slow, each draw of the cigarette carefully timed, each puff of smoke meticulously blown. Anna appeared a natural. Even as she took her first deep inhale, she maintained an aura of grace that made the scene incredibly compelling.  
  
With the last wisp of smoke released from Anna's lips, the camera stopped rolling. The room fell into silence for a moment before breaking into excited chatter. The girls quickly moved to post the video on their Patreon account, their fingers flying over the keyboard in their haste. The ""publish"" button was clicked, the link to the video was live, and with that, the waiting game began.  
  
As they sat around, eagerly refreshing the Patreon page to monitor the views and comments, their conversations ebbed and flowed around potential scenarios. ""What if it doesn't get many views?"" Anna asked, biting her lip nervously.  
  
""Then we try again, maybe change something up,"" Lily responded, her arm draped comfortingly over Anna's shoulders.  
  
""But what if it goes viral?"" Becca chimed in, her eyes wide with excitement.  
  
""Then we brace ourselves for a whirlwind,"" Chloe stated, her eyes never leaving the screen.  
  
In between the nervous anticipation and overwhelming excitement, the girls found themselves teetering on the edge of a future they couldn't fully predict. But one thing was certain: they were in this together, ready to navigate whatever came their way.  


\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
I'm including the response I got when I asked it to generate a list of potential events that might happen next:

**ChatGPT**

1. The girls anxiously watch as the views and subscribers on their Patreon account start to surge. Anna's debut video is a huge hit, and this success encourages Sammi and Becca to agree to try smoking on camera too.
2. Chloe, Lily, and Anna make a detailed plan on how to train Sammi and Becca, who are eager but nervous about their upcoming debut.
3. As the channel grows, Chloe, Lily, and Anna need to balance their online presence with their real-life responsibilities, particularly schoolwork and graduation preparations. This struggle starts to put a strain on their friendship.
4. One of their classmates stumbles upon their YouTube channel, threatening to expose their secret operation. The girls have to figure out how to handle this situation.
5. The girls decide to try different types of smoking-related content to maintain interest in their channel, such as reviewing different brands of cigarettes, or doing Q&A videos where they answer viewer questions while smoking.
6. Chloe's parents start to suspect something when they notice the smell of smoke on her clothes. Chloe has to think quickly to come up with an explanation.
7. A popular social media influencer discovers their channel and shares it with their followers, leading to a sudden increase in views and subscribers. This also leads to a flood of requests and suggestions for future videos.
8. The girls start to feel the health effects of their new habit. They must decide whether the success of their channel is worth risking their health.
9. The girls start to monetize their channel in other ways, such as selling merchandise or sponsored content, leading to disagreements about how to distribute the profits.
10. They receive an invitation to attend a popular YouTuber event, which could significantly boost their channel's visibility but would also require them to reveal their identities publicly.
11. A rival smoking ASMR channel emerges, and the girls have to figure out how to maintain their unique appeal amidst growing competition.
12. With graduation looming, the girls must consider the future of their channel and whether they can continue their smoking videos once they head to college or embark on different career paths.
13. Chloe begins to feel an addiction to nicotine and struggles with her dependence on cigarettes, causing tension within the group.

Hope you enjoyed, let me know if you have ideas for using GPT better or want to talk about the prompts I used.

Jun 28, 2023

Since its introduction less than a year ago, ChatGPT, the artificial  intelligence platform that can write essays, solve math problems and  write computer code, has sparked an anguished debate in the world of  education. Is it a useful research tool or an irresistible license to  cheat?

Stella Tan, a producer on The Daily, speaks to teachers and  students as they finish their first semester with ChatGPT about how it  is changing the classroom.

**On today's episode:**

 [Stella Tan](https://www.nytimes.com/by/stella-tan), an audio producer for The New York Times. 

**Background reading:**

I wonder if there are other unconventional use case’s I’m missing for GPT-4. 

I personally use GPT-4 as my personal teacher with infinite patience. If I’m interested in certain topic, I usually start reading a textbook on it, but more often that not I get confused by what’s in the book. So I ask chatgpt to explain it using the prompts like “Explain the intuition behind X”. “Provide an actual example with explanation”. I also experimented with “I’m a student studying X. You are a professor with extensive knowledge in X. Explain Y to me in simple terms”. 

My studying progress has sped up exponentially with chatgpt. I’ve already covered 2 courses in like 2-3 months. The ability to solve math problems correctly and provide explanation is a game changer for gpt4. 

What’s your personal use case?"

Lesson #1: Developing Character's Emotional Depth

Writing Prompt:
Today, we're going to focus on the character of Duke Richard Warwick. Your task is to write a 300 to 500 words scene where Duke Warwick is alone in his quarters after one of his conversations with Emperor Bastien, where he requests for reinforcements on his border. The Emperor has been non-committal, leaving Warwick in a state of uncertainty. The goal is to delve into the Duke's emotional state and to provide insights into his fears, hopes, and motivations.

This is a great opportunity to deepen the character's emotional depth and to offer readers more insight into his personality and state of mind. Remember, conflict (both internal and external) is the engine of every story, and this scene is rich with internal conflict.

Consider the following questions as you write:

How does he feel about Bastien's non-committal response?
What are his fears for his homeland?
How does his personality as an Enneagram Type 7 - The Enthusiast - factor into his reactions and thoughts?
What habits or mannerisms (like playing with his mustache) does he exhibit when he's alone and lost in thought?
Remember, show don't tell. Don't say he's worried. Show us his worry through his actions, dialogue, and thoughts.

Once you've written the scene, we'll review and discuss it, looking at how effectively you've delved into Warwick's character and how you can further enhance it. Now, let your creativity flow.

Embryo Videos for MBBS

￼￼

Hey, i need help with mbbs 1st year resources. I am currently studying embryology on my own from Langman Embryology book, but i need video lectures to understand the concept better. Which free video resources can i use to understand embryology better?

ChatGPT

When it comes to free video resources for studying embryology, there are several platforms you can explore. Here are a few options:

YouTube: YouTube offers a vast range of educational content, including video lectures on embryology. You can search for channels specifically dedicated to medical education or embryology, such as Armando Hasudungan, Handwritten Tutorials, or Dr. Najeeb Lectures. These channels provide detailed explanations and visual aids to help you understand the subject better.

Khan Academy: Khan Academy is a popular online learning platform that provides free educational videos on various subjects, including embryology. Their videos are well-structured and cover the fundamental concepts of embryology in a clear and concise manner.

Embryology Online by The University of Fribourg: The University of Fribourg offers a comprehensive online embryology course with video lectures. Although it's primarily aimed at their medical students, the course is accessible to anyone interested in the subject. You can access the lectures on their website: https://www.unifr.ch/ifaa/Public/EntryPage/ViewPG.php?AorB=1&ZIEL=EmbryoLectures.

Embryology Meducation by Dr. John McLachlan: Dr. John McLachlan, an anatomy professor, has created a series of video lectures on embryology called ""Embryology Meducation."" These lectures are available for free on YouTube and cover various topics in embryology with a focus on medical education.

Remember to supplement your video lectures with the content from your Langman Embryology book for a comprehensive understanding of the subject. Good luck with your studies!"
14lh2pg,2,2023-06-28,Sasaki brothers year 2,u/DueSmell0,CTsandbox,https://www.reddit.com/r/CTsandbox/comments/14lh2pg/sasaki_brothers_year_2/,"This is a continuation of the heavenly restricted twins Kenji and Kouji.

Part 1: [https://www.reddit.com/r/CTsandbox/comments/14lg97h/heavenly\_conjoined\_twins\_the\_sasaki\_brothers\_year/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CTsandbox/comments/14lg97h/heavenly_conjoined_twins_the_sasaki_brothers_year/)

Part 3: [https://www.reddit.com/r/CTsandbox/comments/14libpe/sasaki\_brothers\_year\_3/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CTsandbox/comments/14libpe/sasaki_brothers_year_3/)

&#x200B;

STORY, CONT'D: Over the course of their first year at Kyoto Jujutsu High, the Sasaki twins researched the nature of their souls and how to separate themselves under the tutelage of Yuki. What they discovered after a year of research was that they were stuck together as a result of Kouji's CT.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# Year 2 Kenji:

OCCUPATION: Second year student/grade 4 sorcerer (he was demoted as he no longer contains all of Kouji's CE), Kyoto Jujutsu High

HEAVENLY RESTRICTION: Kenji's HR remains incomplete, as while Dual Transfiguration can separate their bodies, their souls are still conjoined.

CURSED TOOLS: Without Kouji all the time, Kenji needed to start using cursed tools to interact with curses. He began wearing a pair of cursed glasses that allow him to see cursed energy. He carries around an arsenal of small cursed tools that he can hide on himself and keep with him in public spaces, like knives and brass knuckles.

# 

# Year 2 Kouji:

OCCUPATION: Second year student/grade 2 sorcerer (due to their separation, Kouji was finally recognized as a sorcerer), Kyoto Jujutsu High

APPEARANCE: Kouji's body, made from Dual Transfiguration, is extremely frail with pale skin, long white hair, and black sclera. He wears the traditional Jujutsu High uniform with his hair tied back in a bun.

HEAVENLY RESTRICTION: Though Dual Transfiguration can give Kouji a body of his own, it is incredibly weak and fragile. This weakness can somewhat make up for this by reinforcing with his immense CE. Having his own body also further weakens his HR, reducing the amount of CE he can use (though it is still far above average). In the past year, he also learned the following techniques:

INNATE TECHNIQUE: CHIMERIC GEMINI - Kouji's CT allows him to fuse his soul with another. He activated it subconsciously in the womb, fusing himself to Kenji without a way to unfuse.

EXTENSION TECHNIQUE: PARTIAL TRANSFIGURATION: By altering the nature of their fusion, Kouji is able to manifest parts of his own body out of Kenji's, making them appear like parasitic twins. He can move these parts himself and use them for much more efficient CE use.

EXTENSION TECHNIQUE: DUAL TRANSFIGURATION - By using Partial Transfiguration to its maximum ability, Kouji manifests not just a body part but his entire body, connected to Kenji only at a single point. This point can be cut, allowing the two of them to finally have their own bodies. While both prefer to remain separate, this can be undone to bring the two back into one body.

SHIKIGAMI TECHNIQUE: PARTIAL SACRIFICE - Kouji can cut off pieces of his own body and use them as mediums to create shikigami of various sizes and shapes. The shikigami's strength also varies depending on the amount of flesh and CE used to create them. Kouji can regrow sacrificed body parts with RCT in order to repeat this, but it's very CE-draining to do so.

DOMAIN EXPANSION: AMNIOTIC SINGULARITY - Kouji's DE takes the form of a large, dark, womb-like space. It allows him to sprout countless body parts which he has total control over out of the body of anyone caught within. These can be used to attack the target or simply crush them as body parts continuously protrude out of them. These body parts disappear when the domain is deactivated."

I just wanted to write this post to potentially help out the grade 11s who will be heading to grade 12 next year on what I wish I knew before going into grade 12. I would say grade 12 for me was quite successful of a year and I was able to make 3/4 of my top choices (if you want more info on that you can go through my post history). Here is a semi-formal compilation of advice and general statements I wish I knew that I wanted to share with this subreddit. If you disagree with the things I say, that's cool. However please keep it chill in the comments, please.

**Tip #1 - Read this Subreddit Cautiously**

I'd first like to preface this by saying that this subreddit is a great resource. I learned many practical things which helped me get into my preferred programs such as how to write good supplementary applications/the AIF, how to do video interviews properly, etc. However, I would also like to explore the flip side of that which is this subreddit can also be a breeding ground for misinformation.

Many of the people on this subreddit are high school students. Although many of them have the best intentions in mind, for questions relating to specific information on programs I highly recommend going to individual university subreddits, discords, or rather talking to the students in those programs 1:1 (whether it be through Linkedin or specific workshops organized by your University) about their experiences. There are many misconceptions I have seen surrounding Waterloo and UofT Engineering/CS that many students I talked to completely debunked. This also goes to the other side too, do not simply spread rumors about particular programs when you've never been in that program. If you do, provide proof of some kind to back up your claims.

This isn't just limited to programs though, things such as specific dates of when Universities will send out offers, whether or not they are rolling, etc. are also complete speculations from last year (or sometimes even completely made up). I remember reading comments on this or another subreddit saying Waterloo Engineering offers will go out on a particular week but nothing happened.

The main point is, PLEASE do your own research before going to this subreddit. Consult multiple, trustworthy sources, not just one. Use your critical judgment and decide whether or not you think a claim being made is fictitious or not. It will save you a lot of stress.

**Tip #2 - Early Admission and Grade 11 Marks**

When I was in grade 11 going into grade 12 I thought early admission was similar to the American system where there are specific dates when you apply to universities early (usually in the fall), and the universities will read those applications early and reject or deny you based on them and your grades (usually in winter). However early admission in the Ontario system means something entirely different.

Everyone will be given a pin number, where they can register into the application system (OUAC) and you will apply only once. When you apply, some universities will send you a supplementary written portion you need to submit by a particular date to move your application forward. Whereas others send you absolutely nothing. For the ones that don't send anything they will only look at your grades from semester 1 midterms to semester 2 midterms, and if your marks meet the cut they'll accept you. That is early acceptance in a nutshell. This is where the question of ""Do grade 11 marks matter or not?"" comes in and I will answer... yes and no.

For most, usually less competitive, programs, it will (only for early admission though). For example, I received my TMU CS offer literally 1 week after I applied in mid-November. Which means they looked at my grade 11 marks. For competitive programs in CS/Engineering on the other hand, at select universities such as UofT or Waterloo, they won't matter as much if at all really. I got my offer from Waterloo CE in late May where only grade 12 marks were registered into the system. However, for UofT, they did look at my grade 11 physics mark cause I didn't have the grade 12 equivalent in the March round. So really my advice would be to focus on prerequisites in grade 11 as those can be useful later on.

**Tip #3 - Have Balance**

This is going to be a cliche point, so I won't expand on it too much. Yes, study as hard as you can, grade 12 is important. However, in my opinion, you should always have some balance. I studied hard however I always tried to give myself breathing room whenever I could. It'll help you from being burnt out and improve your grades ironically.

**Tip #4 - Start Supplmentaries Early**

This mainly applies to competitive programs but also scholarships too.

By starting your supplementaries early you will have more time to think about your work and whether or not you think it has quality. When I write something for the first time, in my head I may think it is perfect in the moment. However, when I re-read it or ask another person to read it, there are many flaws and nitpicky things that are revealed (kinda like this post lol). By starting early you will have more chances to examine and debate your ideas and thus produce higher quality work.  I saw too many people leave their supplementary last minute and I think it would have helped if they had more time to think.

Always let another person review your writing. Ideally, it should be a private university admissions counselor (one which is legitimate) but obviously, most people ( including me) do not have such resources. So, maybe talk to your English teacher or someone you trust as even though they may not know about the specifics of university admissions they can help refine your grammar or your writing style. All of which are important.

**Tip #5 - It Is Not Over Until It Is Over**

I remember the first English assignment I received had a mark in the 80s. It was quite worrying because I had doubts about whether I would be able to make it into my top choices due to a low English mark. However, as the semester progressed. I gradually improved, asking my teacher for feedback, and naturally, my marks increased and I finished with a mid-90 in English. The same thing happened in physics too. Just because you receive 1 bad mark or 2 it absolutely does not mean you won't finish with a good final mark. Just keep on grinding and working hard (but also efficiently... I'll get to that soon). Even if the results go poorly, you at least could show you worked hard for it.

Conversely, do not get too relaxed when you get in. Although most conditionals (certain averages you need to maintain in order to go to your university) are quite easy to earn. I know multiple people who stopped studying and got too close to the sun, especially near exam season. I highly recommend you do well in the first 70-85% of the course so that when exams come around the stress levels won't be too hard on you. That was the case for me and I am eternally thankful for my past self.

**Tip #6 - Pre-Study**

This might be controversial but I recommend pre-studying the material in the summer before grade 12. Obviously don't go all out and enjoy your summer but learn the fundamentals. Things such as basic algebra, graphing, solving quadratics, etc. are too often missed yet are highly important to succeeding in certain courses like math and physics. And maybe if you are really ambitious go and cover grade 12 material. There are many great resources online such as Ms. Havrot for Ontario grade 12 curriculum, Professor Leonard for calculus, Walter Lewin for physics, etc. Additionally, there are free textbook PDFs out there if you look deep enough. I pre-studied advanced functions and calc over the summer and it has been EXTREMELY useful to me now.

**Tip #7 - Work Efficiently**

If you want to study less for higher marks. Study efficiently. Don't just read your notes, actively try to recall everything from your brain and put it onto a piece of paper. There is wayyyy more theory going into this but you can search for active learning on YouTube or Google. Secondly, focus on things you don't understand. Going through 100 easy problems you are confident with is useless compared to solving 10 difficult questions. If you are having trouble thinking of an idea for English, ask your teacher for ideas, hell even ChatGPT could help you create a basic outline to form a flow of ideas. I could go on and on but these are my three biggest tips.

**Tip #8 - Enjoy What You Are Learning**

Personally, I found grade 12 physics this year really interesting as we covered a lot of deep things such as fields and the fundamental nature of forces. Not everything has to be about marks. Sometimes what you are learning is very cool and interesting and you should enjoy it.

**Conclusion**

On a final note, this is your final year. Enjoy yourself. It doesn't all have to be doom and gloom. There are so many more things I wanted to talk about more but I have to end it here as my hands are getting quite tired. You do not need to take my advice too seriously. I am also a mere high schooler (well I guess not anymore), so again not a beacon of wisdom or anything. I hope my advice here has been helpful. Have a great summer everyone and I wish you all the best in September. This subreddit has truly been such a lifesaver and I'll definitely try to help out future grade 12s in the future. Thank you all so much <3."

With all of the productions popping up, you may have thought of acting, and said to yourself, “that would be fun”… but then thought of the 5 million reasons why you can’t. Now is the right time to realize that dream. This class is the perfect way to get started. First of all - IT IS FUN. When I first started acting it was all about the homework - breaking scenes down, figuring things out. Not in this class. You are on your feet and working every week. Improv games, cold reading, and scene work. No memorization, no rehearsing. The essential core of acting is listening, reacting, and simply being yourself. Feeling nervous and self conscious is common but obviously will impede any performance. My years of training have provided me a way of getting actors to relax and open up to possibility. Most of all I love seeing what is holding an actor back and finding a creative way to just open up and allow a sense of freedom. No experience necessary, just a passion for acting and a willingness to play **(**[**more info and register**](https://www.actorsspaceabq.com/service-page/adult-basics-saturdays)**)**

AI can make the best education in the world accessible to everyone. Generative AI will continue to evolve in ways we can’t yet imagine. This powerful technology will use its incredible capabilities to improve the lives of learners worldwide to make high-quality education available to everyone on the planet.

### Coursera

[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) is a leading online learning platform that offers high-quality courses, certificates, and degree programs from top universities and organizations worldwide. It is one of the most recognizable brands in the online higher education space, with a reputation for providing rigorous, engaging courses that are highly valued by employers and learners alike. It’s because Coursera offers online degree programs in partnership with leading universities. These programs include bachelor’s and master’s degrees that are accredited and replace traditional programs.

The company has long used [ML](https://amazinum.com/machine-learning-services/) and [AI](https://amazinum.com/artificial-intelligence-development/) to improve the platform. One of the most important areas of use of ML technology is content translation and captioning creation. An automated system takes over the operationally intensive activities, increasing higher learner acquisition growth and global conversion rates through localization.

The company’s plan is also to use AI technology to auto-generate course content, structure, and reading materials based on the input of educator partners. This will contribute to the growth of the number of users on the platform and their satisfaction with the service.

 

### Duolingo

[Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) launched in 2011. It has become one of the most downloaded educational apps today, through a powerful mix of personalized learning, immediate feedback, gamification, and rewards. Duolingo currently has around **500 million users**.

Duolingo uses [machine learning](https://amazinum.com/machine-learning-services/) and [natural language processing](https://amazinum.com/insights/tag/nlp-2/) to create tools that assist world-class content developers in auditing and improving hundreds of lessons, challenges, and exercises. Now is also used a new [AI](https://amazinum.com/artificial-intelligence-development/) model “[BirdBrain](https://learn.birdbraintechnologies.com/artificial-intelligence/)”, which gives even better opportunities to users.

Duolingo’s new AI system enables the company to analyze the common mistakes users make and adapt lessons to users’ learning needs. It helps to make corrections and suggestions concerning the sounds and patterns of speech. That provides targeted feedback on your pronunciation. It’s also behind the auto-suggest in Stories freeform writing exercises, that help learners learn to write in the language they’re learning.

Also, it profiles each user and makes accurate predictions about their learning journey to ensure a **personalized experience**. The lessons constantly adapt to how well the learner does on the app. By following how users interact with the app, it can identify areas of strength and weakness, and then adjust the lessons and exercises more engaging. In that way, the learning process will more efficient.

>*“We deliver a better learning experience using artificial intelligence (AI).*”  
Luis von Ahn, CEO of [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/).

# Preface
Hi, everyone. I noticed that there’s a lot of incoming freshmen here, and I just want to share my own piece of advice to help y’all get started, or maybe even some current law students can pick up some things from here.

There’s really no comprehensive guide on starting law school, you just kind of learn by trial and error. But I don't think it's helpful for anyone. I don’t claim to be any better than anyone else, all I have is my experience in going through the law school beast. For what it's worth I did consistently get in the dean's list; so in the midst of my bar review I just wanted to share some things that I wish I knew when I was a freshman. Paying it forward.

Just to preface, I am a firm believer that the high mortality rate from law school comes from the fact that people fail to adjust well entering into their first semester. Because they don’t have any guidance, they form bad study habits, and this leads to bad foundations. Then they think to themselves that they're not putting in enough effort, they're not smart enough or they're just plainly not a good fit for law school.

But that can’t be any further from the truth. More often than not, it’s just a lack of direction in how to approach law school. Having said that, ANYONE CAN DO WELL IN LAW SCHOOL IF THEY HAVE THE RIGHT DIRECTION. Yup, you heard that right. ANYONE.

So in this guide, I wanted to address two foundational aspects must be considered to do well in law school: (i) The practical aspect; and (ii) The mental aspect (mindset) that you need to excel.
___


## **A. Practical aspect:**
* So, you decided to enter the beast. I’m sure you’ve heard the saying that the law is a great equalizer – everyone starts from scratch. You’ve heard the anecdotes where people say *“oh, this guy was summa cum laude in college but didn’t do well in law school”*, or *“I was just average in college but was consistent DL in law school”*. Have you ever wondered why that is? Law school isn’t exactly computer science, theoretical physics, chemistry, or any of those complex subjects where the information just seems IMPOSSIBLE to understand. It’s all taught in plain English. Do you think that people just suddenly lose all their intelligence when they entered into law school?
* So what makes it so hard? It’s actually NOT because it’s harder as a subject per se, but because doing well entails an entirely DIFFERENT sets of skills than what you are used to. In college, you are used to being given X readings then tested on how well you memorized key details (i.e, history class), or how creative you can be in writing an essay given what you learned in lectures (i.e, literature or other research classes), or being able to apply technical formulas in equations (i.e, accounting, mathematics, or finance classes).
* But that doesn’t really all translate right? In law, you are not rewarded for your rote memorization without knowing how to apply it, nor how to write flowery essays, nor solving technical equations. BUT ONLY TWO THINGS: (i) speaking well; and (ii) writing well. In law school, there’s a third aspect to it – (iii) information intake, or as I call it, learning well. You need to learn, but most of all you need to LEARN HOW TO LEARN. These are skills that you might not have the opportunity of training in college, but these are important things that you need to thrive in law school. Those who learn it the fastest will easily find themselves at the top.

### **A.1. Information intake.**
The first thing that you need to get is knowledge. You need information. You can't recite, and you can't answer exams if you don't know the law. So there are three main sources of information that you need to wrap your head around: cases, codals, and commentaries. 

* **READING CASES.** Case assignments will be a constant throughout your law stay, and they are there for a reason. Cases are the lifeblood of learning the law, they not only give you doctrines to use in solving problems, but the SC always gives a master class on the underlying principles behind the rationale of the law.
  *  **Read cases in the originals.** It’s easy to say that the law says X. But it won’t stick to your mind unless you know WHY the law is that way. When you know that WHY, no matter what kahit anong bali-baliktarin pa yan na problem, you would always know the answer because you know if your answer will be fulfilling that underlying rationale – rather than just reading one bullet point in a textbook/reviewer. 
  *  **Start slow.** Learning the law is like learning a new language. As I said in another thread, reading cases in the originals is like exercising a muscle. Hard at first, but it gets easier the more that you do it. You just really need to take your time. At the end of the day, REMEMBER — it is plain English. If case is hard to read, start with one paragraph. If that paragraph is too hard, do one sentence. If one sentence is hard to read, do one word. If one word is hard, you have Google, ChatGPT, whatever at your disposal. The point is, you need to take your time in reading cases. 
  *  **Cultivate discipline.** The more you read in the originals, the better AND faster you will be. The better you are, the more comfortable you are with it. And with comfort comes discipline. When you cultivate that discipline of reading cases in the originals, what you learn in law school will be 10x deeper than if you just read bullet points off of a reviewer. So don't fret if it takes you 20 minutes just to read a single case, do it often enough then you can eventually do it in 10. But you have to put in the work to get better at it.   
  *  **Always look at the big picture.** What is this case trying to teach you in relation to the overall topic? Use the syllabus as your guide. Where does this case fit in? 
  *  *For more, will post a comment on the anatomy of a case to get you started*
* **CODALS AND MEMORY WORK.** There’s no going around it, law school requires memorization. Elements of a crime, exceptions to the general rule, enumerations for jurisdiction, etc. Be comfortable with memorizing.
   * **TIP: Memorize when you're tired.** This came from a professor. It might sound absurd, right? Memorizing when you’re tired? But the logic behind that is that reading cases takes ENERGY – you need to analyze, you need to filter information, and when you’re tired you can be reading the same paragraph 10x and not retain anything. BUT when you’re memorizing, it’s a matter of muscle memory. You just need to say it over and over again, write it over and over again, spaced repetition and what have you. It’s actually a lot more straightforward compared to reading cases if you think about it.
   * **Memorize with understanding.** For codals, it’s often a lot more efficient to just memorize the ones that are often asked in exams, then just familiarize yourself with the rest. That will get you by. Know that you brain has limits, and it is very impractical if not outright wrong to memorize your codals from chronological order verbatim. In other words, be smart with what you learn.
   * **Do not lose sight of the forest for the trees.** Credits to my Oblicon professor. Do not read anything in isolation, but as you read make it form part of a bigger mental picture that involves everything that you have learned in the subject. Memorize with purpose.
   * **Explore memory techniques.** Different things work for everyone. Spaced repetition, mnemonics, mnemonic pegs, writing stuff down, etc. are all some of the techniques I've used throughout the years. Find what works best for you. (_See:_ _Unlimited Memory by Kevin Horsley_ to understand how memory works, and how you can use different techniques to your advantage.) 
* **READING COMMENTARIES.** Commentaries help you consolidate the law in relation to the cases you've read. People often make this mistake that in reading commentaries, it’s about sitting for 2 hours and saying “oh, I finished 100 pages. I must have learned the material!” News flash: No, you didn’t. You just highlighted everything. Close your book, test yourself, what is everything I learned? Chances are, when you start discussing to yourself, you will notice that there are memory gaps. You might have understood that information at the time, but do you have the capacity to remember it when it matters?
   * **KEY ADVICE: Information intake is a completely different skill from information recall.** So how do you learn the material without it drifting away the moment the book closes? First of all, actively take notes. Do not just highlight. Highlighting tricks you into thinking that you know the material. Whereas if you take notes in the book, you would be FORCED to summarize to yourself what you just read.
   * **Test yourself.** Do not just take what you read for granted. Ask things like: “Why does it say in this case that \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, but on the other example it says the complete opposite? What could be different? “; “What if X fact changed, would the answer have been different?”.
   * You see, in the first mindless way of reading books, you would just have a sense of accomplishment without actually learning anything (aka ""pseudo-studying""). Whereas if you’re actually actively reading, you train your brain to have better skills to deal with hypothetical problems come exam time.

### **A.2. Speaking well.**
*The bad news: recitation is a major part of your law school journey.*

*The good news: Speaking well is a skill that can be trained.*

* **Be deliberate in how you speak.** You will be reciting cases for the next four years, so the best thing you can do is to practice it early on. No winging it. Make one step flow from the next. Make it easy for your professor to understand you.
* **Mindset.** The mindset here is that, in most classes your professor won’t lecture, they will simply say, “(Your last name), next case”. You know why they don’t teach? Because in class, you are expected to be the teacher. You are the one teaching. Fill that role and I promise, you’ll get higher grades than your blockmates. And the best way to teach is to have structure.
* **KEY TIP: So always flag the parts of your recitation.** I recommend the following: (i) Sir, in the case of X, the facts are \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. (ii) So the issue here is / The problem here is that \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. (iii) Therefore, the Court ruled that \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. Fill those up, you have a pretty good recit, probably you’ll get a base line of around 80-85.
 * **Want to do better? Stand out**. Bibo as it is, professors would appreciate it if you add input to the lesson, saying something like “In relation to our lesson \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_”, or “This case is important because \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_”. No one else does that and it makes you sound like you’re looking at the big picture. I did this and averaged the highest in our Consti class for recit under a pretty terror professor.
   * If you professor gives you a hypothetical, do the ALAC method even. Answer: ""(Yes/No), (Sir/Ma’am). According to the (codal/case/law), (summarize the rule). So in this case \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. ""
* **Have a system.** A lot of people struggle when there are so many cases assigned in a single meeting, but a system will get you through it. Please, do not mindlessly try to memorize a 20-page case from start to finish. That's a waste of brain space and will get you insane. 
  * **Sample routine.** What I do is that I read the originals, I simultaneously have a printed out copy of the digest in front of me. The digest is what I put my notes on and what I bring to class. The trick here is knowing that in reciting a case, you only need to know the gist of it to “kwento” it in your own words. That’s why it’s important to read in the originals because you’ll understand the story more. That’s what I use my long-term memory for. But I still need to sprinkle it with some specific details, so at the same time, I utilize my short-term memory by putting in the key-terms (e.g., key concepts, enumerations, requisites, names of the parties, sometimes dates for pogi points lol) and simpler notes at the margins of my digest. So what happens is 1-2 minutes before reciting, all I review are those very short notes instead of panicking through a 20-page original text or even a 3-page digest. 
  * Long-term memory (understanding the case enough to make a story) + Short term memory (quick details and key terms to review) = Good case recit. 
* **Practice, practice, practice.** Especially early on, be comfortable with reciting cases. Practice in front of a mirror. Try to see if you can finish a case in the format I mentioned earlier. Are you satisfied? Think it deserves a 90? No? Get better at it. Because if you can't perform well at home alone when nobody is watching with a freshly read case, then what hope do you have of doing well in the classroom?  

### **A.3. Writing well.**
This is your game time. Exams. The first thing you need to understand is just like how information intake is different from recall, exam-taking is another skill. You may think that you learned the material, but can you actually bring out that knowledge when you're confronted with a problem? The only way to prepare is to identify exam-taking as another distinct skill that you need to train separately. 

* **Again: Practice, practice, practice.** As always, there is no way around it. You don't learn issue spotting, for example, from your cases and commentaries. Think of it like swimming. You can read as many books as you want on swimming, but the only way to get better at it is actually doing it. By way of analogy, in basketball if you want to get better at your shooting accuracy, you have to perfect your free throws. So do everything you can to practice your exam-taking skills: samplexes, bar questions, anything humanly possible that tests your APPLICATION of the law. 
* **KEY TIP: Always strategize.** Even before you start your exam grind, learn what kind of questions your professor likes. It’s like Pokemon, you don’t go to a rock type gym just bringing your Pikachu (Hello, _Pokemon Yellow_). What are the common topics that come up? Make a survey of the things that he usually asks and what kind of questions – straightforward, objective, issue spotting based, MCQ, jurisprudence, codal? This will guide you into your review.
   * **It’s all about the 20/80 principle.** Roughly 80% of results come from 20% of causes. It’s impossible for example to learn everything humanly possible for Consti, but 80% of the questions will just revolve around the same topics that come up every year because those are the most important topics. The remaining 20% are curveballs so just familiarize yourself with the rest. Stated otherwise, 80% of your effort should be put in the top 20% of topics. Important thing is that you do not use the samplex to memorize the answers, but use it to strategize well — what are you knowledge gaps? what do you need to learn? how do other people approach this problem? ultimately, how should you allocate your effort?
* **Master the ALAC method.** It’s there for a reason. Don’t try to deviate. Why? Because it gives your professor all the things he needs in order to know your answer, and it is a very logical process. But most people don’t know how to use the ALAC method to their advantage. Let me illustrate:
   * **A — Answer.** “Yes/no”; “Bob is correct”; “No, the petition is unmeritorious”. Just be responsive to the question. Basic, but essential. If you’re answering the wrong question, then you won’t get the points.
   * **L — Legal basis.** Do not try to be fancy if you’re unsure of the case or codal. Start with “According to the law”, “The law provides that”, “Jurisprudence provides that”, or “Under the Revised Penal Code”. Then mention the rule. 
     * **KEY TIP: You do not have to do this verbatim!** You can summarize the rule in your own words! The beauty of it is that once you master structuring the rule in your own words, you can answer any exam question even if you don’t know the law. The question asks, is X correct? Don’t know the answer? Make up a rule! “X is correct. The law provides that when a person does so and so, such is prohibited or such is allowed.” So many people fail by leaving blanks when they don’t know the answer when they can just as easily come up with a rule and have a 50-50 chance for getting a lucky answer, or worst come to worst, at least getting partial points.
   * **A — Application.** Be specific with your facts. Just apply the rule! The law says this, so what? The law doesn't matter if it is not applicable to your case. Then you have to say, okay so let’s apply this rule in this case. “Here, (X did so and so)/(ABC happened)” then make the situation fit under the legal rule that you just laid down. Try to use the same phrasing that the question uses for the facts, as if straight up copy pasting key phrases. 
   * **C — Conclusion.** It’s really just a summary, or even just reiterate the answer. Start with “Therefore,…” or “Hence,…”. And then just say “Because ABC happened, (this situation is clearly prohibited by law)/(this is a void contract)/(anything else that answers the initial exam question).
* **Be in peak condition when you take the exams.** Just my personal style, but I never do an all-nighter before an exam. Give your brain time to breathe. Because you don't want to be overloaded with crammed information hours before the exam. 
  *  First of all, you will panic because all the new info in a short span of time will confuse you. 
  * Secondly, there's a very high chance that you get mental block because your brain is fried. 
  * My personal routine is to aim to stop studying 10 hours before the exam, get enough sleep, and exercise in the morning. I would much rather lose X amount of pages of reading books than lose hours of good sleep. Why? Because as long as I can think straight, I can come up with an answer even if I did not finish the material. I trust that I did my daily grind well enough to think logically through the problem. Whereas if I do an all nighter, with my groggy state all that knowledge goes out the window and I'll be fighting just to think of anything. Do not underestimate the power of a calm mind. 
 * **You do not need to know everything, you only need to know one question at a time.** People worry a lot about not knowing X and Y a few hours before the exam. But trust me, 95% of the things you worry about in last minute review won't come up in the exam. Trust in the popcorn effect, it is a leap of faith. But know that you did the work throughout the semester. 
   * Trust that the answer will come when you see the question — like popcorn cooking and popping inside your brain. Remember what I said earlier about reading the cases in the originals and how it pays off. You might not remember the words but the logic will stay. So breathe. There is no need to cram. It's not worth losing your composure. Focus on relaxing and take the exam with a fresh mind.

## **B. Performance mindset.**
1. **Doing well in law school is not about intelligence, it is about PERFORMANCE.** If you noticed on how I approached the practical skills section, there’s one thing in common – they are all TRAINABLE. These are all skills that do not take 200 IQ to learn, it’s not rocket science, and it is something that anyone can work on. Sometimes it’s hard because people put in the effort but they do not know where to put it towards. But if you have these concrete sets of skills that you know you need to perform in, you can always look towards that goal.
2. **On burnout: Fatigue management is one of the most important things that you have to learn.** It really is a marathon, not a race. The daily grind is not really so bad, only a few hours each day maybe. But consider the fact that you will do this for months on end – everyday being a chance for recitation. It’s kind of like the metaphor of the rock being withered down by water. Hard at first, but gets taken down by time. If you don’t give your body time to rest, your body will do it for you. Trust me, you do not want to be at that point. Because the worst that can happen is that it’s in the middle of the semester, you’re completely sleep deprived, you still have cases to read, and you are at zero motivation with brain fog for weeks. That will kill you both academically and physically.
3. **On sleep: Sleep is important.** Do not fall into the habit that in order to be a good student, you need to give up on sleep. Study in the morning if you can, just purely anecdotal but most of the people who topped my class I noticed were morning people and slept early. My theory is that it has something to do with the lack of disturbance in the morning / having a natural nocturnal cycle. Case in point: notice how after a long day you can be reading a paragraph 10x and not absorb anything, but the next morning you only needed one read to understand the entire thing. There’s also physiological effects of tiredness/fatigue buildup in your system that you can only flush away with sleep. Hence, why stay up all night for 5 cases when you can do 10 cases half the time in the morning? It’s not only good for you but efficient as well.
4. **On goals: Do not aim to “not fail”**  —  **aim to do well.** If you’re only aiming to pass, you will study just enough to hope for a 75. But if you’re aiming for the top, then even your worst case scenario will still be a passing mark. Your goals define your habits. If your battlefield is at the top, then even failing means still passing. On the other hand slipping up when you’re aiming for a 75 could mean the end of your law school journey before you know it.
5. **On anxiety: Anxiety will always be there.** But there’s a secret that a professor taught me once: Anxious? That’s normal. But the only cure for that is understanding. Perfect understanding. Because when you understand something perfectly, no matter how your professor twists the question, you answer will always be the same. So aim to understand everything perfectly. The other thing is to replace anxiety with excitement. The professor giving a hard case for recitation? No one can answer the question? Be excited because you perfectly understand the case and you can show what you learned. Let the prospect of success overcome the fear of failure.
6. **On failure: Advice on processing failure.** Do not let failure define you. No, I’m not saying this as some thoughtcatalog bullshit that is just meant to soften the blow. It’s easy to fail for the stupidest of reasons. Know that since law school is about strategizing and performance, failing just means that you did something wrong and you can always fix it. Maybe nagkamaling diskarte ka lang, mali yung approach for the exam since you studied codals and your prof asks cases. Do not make the mistake of thinking that it has to do with intelligence. Again, it’s all about performance. You lose when you take failure personally. Learn from it, adjust, and try again. Take it from me, I nearly failed one subject in first year by a THIN margin, re-calibrated myself and have been consistently topping the Dean’s List ever since. Not saying this to brag but just to prove a point that the next recit, the next exam, will always be a clean slate. So don’t waste time doubting yourself and just perform better. *(See: The Inner Game of Tennis by W. Timothy Gallwey)*
7. **Active learning.** I’ve touched on this before, but I’ll say it again: do not settle for blindly highlighting your materials! Always ask yourself again, challenge yourself. It’s easy to read cases and know the rulings. But you know what’s hard? When you’re confronted with a brand new case in the exam. Question the decisions! What if this happened instead, what would have happened? The court says that this is a principle, but how about in this absurd situation would it still apply? Test the logic to the limits. And again, recall is a VERY different skill from absorption. Train yourself to always test information that you read.
8. **Have a good support system.** Be kind. Being a self-made person is nothing more than a delusion. We all survive law school together. Share your reviewers. Why? Because even if it doesn’t benefit you at that time, you support creating a culture of people helping each other. This will define how your professors see your block. They kind of get a vibe for it. But on a more human level, you’ll be here for 4 years, try to make it a nice place to be for everyone around you. You don’t get higher by dragging others down.
___


## **C. Reading Recommendations.**
I’ve seen a lot of people ask for reading recommendations. These are just some mindset (non law-related) books that I think people should read prior to entering law school and even the legal profession.

1. **The Formula: The Universal Laws of Success by Albert-László Barabási.** Get out the notion that success is only attainable by the chosen few. Know what it actually takes to be successful, and how to interpret “failure”.
2. **The Inner Game of Tennis: The Classic Guide to the Mental Side of Peak Performance by W. Timothy Gallwey .** A must read for learning how to perform well in general, knowing that too much effort can also be detrimental, and knowing how not to beat yourself up for mistakes will actually make you a better law student.
3. **Unlimited Memory by Kevin Horsley.** More of a practical book. Started this in 4th year only when I realized that my memory game needed to be in shape for Bar review. But man, I do wish I read this earlier. It was game changing – knowing that rote memorization isn’t the only way to remember things. Using visualization and imagination made things so much easier for me it’s honestly crazy.
4. **The Bramble Bush: On Our Law and Its Study by Karl Llewellyn.** Hard read, but an inspirational one. I read this before entering law school, I suggest at least reading the first few chapters. Helps you romanticize what really you are studying the law for. At the same time, it gets you prepared for reading difficult things.
5. **Deep Work by Cal Newport.** Helps you learn the value of focused work, deep study, in a very distracted world.
6. [**Study Tips from Dr. K, 2.5 GPA to Medical School to Harvard Residency | Dr. K Explains**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lw4dMehQkgs)**.** HIGHLY recommend. Teaches everything about study habits -- the scientific process of learning, the importance of sleep, and how you can use it to your advantage.
7. **The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari by Robin Sharma** It's about a superstar lawyer who had a near-fatal heart attack in the midst of his career, eventually realizing that there is more to life than just work and getting burnt out. I'm sure a lot of people will relate. Teaches you how to approach the law with passion rather than suffering. 
___


That’s it! I wish you all the best of luck, and feel free to message if you have anything on your mind. I’m sure there’s a couple more things that I want to add, especially for mindset, but it’s 4:30 am and my brain is not braining anymore.

Again, just paying it forward, I just hope that this helps at least one person fulfill their dreams of becoming a lawyer in the future.

The instructions are often just 2 or 3 sentences and don't specify anything about wordcount, APA, etc. The peer assessment forms follow suit: very basic.

Here are my week 3 written assignment instructions:
""Suppose a firm finds that the marginal product of capital is 60 and the marginal product of labor is 20. If the price of capital is $6 and the price of labor is $2.50, describe how the firm should adjust its mix of capital and labor? What will be the result?""

In week 2, I submitted a 770-word APA-style essay, but all 3 students I peer assessed just blatantly copy and pasted some raw ChatGPT output. All three were almost identical, and two of them weren't even finished. It was as if Chat GPT stalled and the student didn't even check what they were copy and pasting. 

The annoying thing is that those submissions still basically meet all of the requirements and the scoring criteria for the peer assessment is just 100% based on making correct calculations. 

Is this correct? 
It doesn't seem right to me. 

I could have just copy and pasted the calculation from ChatGPT and got the same (or an even higher) score with barely any effort at all. 
I spent 2/3 hours writing my essay."

1.Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates saying generative AI chatbots can teach kids to read in 18 months rather than years.

Artificial intelligence is beginning to prove that it can accelerate the impact teachers have on students and help solve a stubborn teacher shortage.

Chatbots backed by large language models can help students, from primary education to certification programs, self-guide through voluminous materials and tailor their education to specific learning styles.

3. WinGPT is a new ChatGPT app for your ancient Windows 3.1 PC

Dust off your old 386-powered PC and get ready to run ChatGPT

The developer shared, that the most interesting parts of building this were:

\- Getting TLS 1.2 and 1.3 working on Windows 3.1 so that WinGPT could directly connect to OpenAI's server without relying on a modern machine for TLS termination.

\- Learning about the memory segmentation architecture on 16-bit Windows, including the difference between far and near pointers.

\- Building the UI in plain C code with the Windows API and limited selection of controls in Windows 3.1.

To get the latest information on AI, [look here first](https://www.theedge.so/subscribe). All of the information has been extracted to Reddit for your convenience.

**Key Takeaways:** 

Sam Altman was blown away by the use cases of ChatGPT. From high school students in Nigeria using ChatGPT for simplified learning to civil servants in Singapore leveraging OpenAI tools for efficient public service delivery, AI’s reach is expanding thanks to Open AI

Sam Altman found that countries worldwide share similar hopes and concerns about AI. With the common fear of AI safetyPolicymakers are heavily invested in AI. 

Across the globe, leaders are focused on ensuring the safe deployment of AI tools, maximizing their benefits, and mitigating potential risks. There is significant interest in a continuous dialogue with leading AI labs and a global framework to manage future powerful AI systems.

**Why you should care:**

People around the world want clarity on OpenAI’s core values (probably including you). The tour provided a platform to emphasize that customer data is not used in training and that users can opt-out easily.

Despite this claim, data isn’t used in training. Open AI is facing a class action lawsuit for stealing data and using it to train its models. More about that here.

**Open AI's next steps:**

“Making their products more useful, impactful, and accessible.”

“Further developing best practices for governing highly capable foundation models.”

“Working to unlock AI’s benefits.”

14nfd55,269,2023-06-30,"Grad student totally played me, and I am an idiot",u/zazzlekdazzle,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/14nfd55/grad_student_totally_played_me_and_i_am_an_idiot/,"I don't know if I need advice or just a mini-vent.  

This is far from the greatest frustration any of you face, or even I have faced, but it just floors me how students still can surprise me at this stuff.

I teach an online summer graduate class for students getting their MS in Data Science. Usually, these are (hands down) my best and most organized students. No doubt this is because these students have regular jobs all day and are spending their valuable time and money on the classes - both resources they likely have little of.

So, I don't usually have many policies to get around the usual arms race of students trying to get away with sh*t. But this semester, I had a student who totally played me.

I never had a grad student who just straight-up lied and cheated like this one - and in such obvious ways. I grade the graduate student homework on completion rather than accuracy. Now, this has never been an issue with grad students. But, this was my first mistake with Cheater here. Cheater either just guessed on the multiple choice questions or had ChatGPT do the coding questions for them. They could not reproduce even the most basic tasks in class.

I also have in-class labs that I grade the same way as the homework. I usually think this is less of an issue than the homework because I am right here while they do it. (Not in person, but you get it.)  Cheater was always having issues with their video and audio and couldn't participate fully in the labs. When they did, I would ask how they were doing, and they said fine and never needed any help. I set up a system so the students would submit the answers on an online form, and sure enough, it looks like ChatGPT was doing the labs, too! When the class got to the point where good old AI couldn't do the work for Cheater anymore, they just started handing in random, almost gibberish (this I at least feel OK marking incomplete, and I told them so).

But you know what, Cheater gets full credit for all the homework and most of the labs because I did not explain to the grad students that they need to use the material I teach in the class to answer the questions (like I do for undergrads) because I never needed to before. I mean, who pulls this sh*t as a grad student?

Right now, I am giving the final. And, sure enough, little Cheater has sworn up and down that they submitted their exam. Yet, I do not have it. I have no doubt Cheater is having trouble piecing something together and is buying time to send me whatever later. The old ""my computer must have corrupted that file, here is the real one (submitted the next day)"" trick. 

Now, I do not have a lateness policy (mistake number 347 considering Cheater) for a FINAL EXAM because who the f\*\*k does that as a grad student? Since I don't have a stated lateness policy, I will have to grade this f\*\*King exam, and whatever they get, plus all their complete but completely garbage assignments (2/3s of the grade) will likely get them maybe a B- in a class they did nothing for and learned nothing from.

**Can I retroactively dock this student some points on their final for being late if I don't have a lateness policy for exams?**

I am an idiot.

EDIT: OK, I think I may have an out. In my syllabus, under the section on homework assignments, as the last line: ""Due to the quick pace of the class, I cannot accept late work."" Now, it *could* be taken to mean it only applied to homework assignments, but I do say that is my lateness policy - I don't accept late work. Will this work?

**EDIT2: The saga continues!**

As the top comment suggested here, we did some legit exploration which revealed that the student DID submit the exam not just on time but quite early. 

But...one thing I omitted above, for brevity, is that I allow a one-hour grace period after the exam deadline to take care of any technical issues, like this very one. I tell the students about this grace period and what it's for. I expect, but do not explicitly state, that they will be alert around this time to take care of any issues. 

When I saw the student did not have an exam submitted, and when they did not respond to my inquiries during the grace period, I assumed they were buying time and snowing me. I was not bothered that I did not see the exam at the deadline - issues like theirs happen all the time, and the students know there is a pad of time, so that's fine if they use it. *What got me was that I did not get a response during the grace period, not until almost two hours later.* 

But here's the rub - the student needed to submit the exam early and was not contactable because they had to go to the emergency room. (I actually believe the student about the ER because they had relevant and persistent health issues all term.)

The student is extremely apologetic about missing my alerts during the grace period and begging me not to penalize their grade, and I'm in a tough position. If the student had been honest with me all semester and did their work in good faith, I wouldn't bat an eyelash about giving them a pass for not being around during the grace period for a health emergency. The student thought they were all set, so they assumed there was no need to be on alert for problems (not the smartest assumption, but I get it)."
