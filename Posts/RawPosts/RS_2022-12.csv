""OMSCS, a program of excellence

A program for the future, a program that's intense

A program for students, a program for learners

A program that challenges, a program that empowers

With a focus on technology, and a focus on innovation

OMSCS is a force to be reckoned with, a program with a reputation

For producing leaders, for producing thinkers

For producing graduates, who are on the brink of greatness

OMSCS, a program of opportunity

A program that opens doors, a program that's worth the journey

A program that changes lives, a program that inspires

OMSCS, a program that sets the standard, a program that never tires."""

z9xuft,7,2022-12-01,Alternate ending according to Ai,u/Joni_Joni_Al,harrypotter,https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/z9xuft/alternate_ending_according_to_ai/,"I asked chatgpt to write me an alternate ending to the series. Here it is:

In this alternate ending, Harry Potter and his friends successfully defeat Lord Voldemort and his followers in the Battle of Hogwarts. However, after the battle, Harry realizes that he has lost his parents, his godfather Sirius, and many of his friends and mentors, and he is overcome with grief and sadness. He decides to leave Hogwarts and the wizarding world behind, and he goes into hiding, to mourn and to heal.
Years pass, and Harry becomes a reclusive and mysterious figure, living in a remote cabin in the Scottish Highlands. He is visited occasionally by Ron and Hermione, who bring him news from the wizarding world and try to persuade him to return. Harry, however, is not interested, and he spends his days reading, writing, and gardening, trying to forget his past and to find peace.
One day, Harry receives a letter from Neville Longbottom, who has become the Headmaster of Hogwarts. Neville tells Harry that he is retiring, and he asks Harry to take over as the Headmaster of Hogwarts. Harry is hesitant at first, but he eventually agrees, and he returns to Hogwarts, to teach and to mentor the next generation of wizards and witches.
At Hogwarts, Harry finds a new sense of purpose and fulfillment, and he is able to pass on his knowledge and his experiences to the students. He also reconnects with Ron and Hermione, who are now married and have children of their own. Harry becomes a beloved Headmaster, and he is respected and admired by the students and the staff. He also finds love, and he marries Ginny Weasley, who is now a successful Quidditch player and a mother.
In the final scene, we see Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny standing on the top of the Astronomy Tower, looking at the stars and the full moon. They are happy and content, and they are surrounded by the people they love. The end."
zadv78,3,2022-12-02,Harvard fact of the day,u/Significant-Notice-,marginal,https://www.reddit.com/r/marginal/comments/zadv78/harvard_fact_of_the_day/,"Harvard employs 7,024 total full-time administrators, only slightly fewer than the undergraduate population. What do they all do?

And an example:

Yet of the 7,000-strong horde, it seems that many members’ primary purpose is to squander away tax-free money intended for academic work on initiatives, projects, and committees that provide scant value to anyone’s educational experience.

For example, last December, all Faculty of Arts and Sciences affiliates received an email from Dean Claudine Gay announcing the final report of the FAS Task Force on Visual Culture and Signage, a task force itself created by recommendation of the Presidential Task Force on Inclusion and Belonging. This task force was composed of 24 members: six students, nine faculty members, and nine administrators. The task force produced a 26-page report divided into seven sections, based upon a survey, focus groups, and 15 separate meetings with over 500 people total. The report dedicated seven pages to its recommendations, which ranged from “Clarify institutional authority over FAS visual culture and signage” to “Create a dynamic program of public art in the FAS.” In response to these recommendations, Dean Gay announced the creation of a new administrative post, the “FAS campus curator,” and a new committee, the “FAS Standing Committee on Visual Culture and Signage.”

Regardless of your stance on the goal of fostering a more inclusive visual culture, the procedural absurdity is clear. A presidential task force led to the creation of an FAS task force which, after expending significant time, effort, and resources, led to the creation of a single administrative job and a committee with almost the exact name as the second task force. I challenge anyone other than the task force members themselves to identify the value created for a single Harvard student’s educational experience.

A ne Frank Parallel Stories (2019)  Through her diary, Anne Frank’s story is retold alongisde those of five Holocaust survivors in this poignant docuentary fro Oscar winner Hellen Mirren. (Netflix)

1945 (2016, Hungarian) Ferenc Török’s recent film begins on a summer day in 1945, when an Orthodox Jew and his son get off a train in a tiny Hungarian village. This doesn’t bode well for the villagers, who are worried their community’s deported Jews will come back to reclaim the property and possessions stolen from them.Quiet, subtle, and fair, 1945 is a very different kind of film.

The Accountant of Auschwitz (2018) In 2015, 94-year-old former German SS officer Oskar Gröning, nicknamed “The Accountant of Auschwitz”, went on trial in his home country, charged with complicity in the murder of 300,000 Jews at Auschwitz in 1944. The Accountant of Auschwitz is a gripping look at the race against time to prosecute the last living Nazi war criminals before it’s too late. Gröning’s trial reflects not only one frail bookkeeper’s penitence, but the world’s responsibility to hold the worst of human horrors forever to public view. Bringing war criminals to justice, with no statute of limitations, asks fundamental moral questions with few simple answers.

Amen (2002) War drama about newly-commissioned Lieutenant Gerstein (Ulrich Tukur), who witnesses the chemical disinfectant he’s helped perfect being used to systematically murder interred Jews. The only sympathetic ear he is able to find is that of young Father Riccardo (Mathieu Kassovitz), a priest with deep ties to the Vatican. While Riccardo takes on the obstructive Vatican hierarchy, Gerstein must walk a tightrope between documenting and enabling the atrocities his fellow SS officers cold-bloodedly commit. As the two unlikely allies fight to reveal the truth to the Church and the world, they discover that the fates of a man of conscience committing treason for the sake of humanity and a man of God committing heresy to thwart genocide are ultimately the same. (Directed by Costa-Gavras.)

Angry Harvest (1975) In the winter of 1942-43, a Jewish family leaps from a train going through Silesia. They are separated in the woods, and Leon, a local peasant who’s now a farmer of some wealth, discovers a woman, Rosa, and hides her in his cellar. Leon’s a middle-aged Catholic bachelor, tormented by his sexual drive. He doesn’t tell Rosa he’s seen signs her husband is alive, and he begs her to love him. Rosa offers herself to Leon if he’ll help a local Jew in hiding who needs money. Leon pays, and love between Rosa and him does develop, but then Leon’s peasant subservience and his limited empathy lead to tragedy. At the war’s end, a ray of sunshine comes from an unexpected place.

Another Mother’s Son (2017) Based on the true story of Louisa Gould, the drama is set during World War II on the Nazi-occupied island of Jersey. Gould took in an escaped Russian POW and hid hi over the course of the war. A film which brings attention to the little-known story of the Channel Islands’ brutal occupation under the Nazis. ( Prime Video)

Auschwitz: The Nazis and the Final Solution (2005) Powerful six-part documentary series from the BBC, which presents an in-depth look at the story of Auschwitz and features interviews with former inmates, guards and re-enactments of historic events. From conception to reality, mass murder, experimentation and ultimately liberation and revenge, the series covers all aspects of this notorious Nazi camp, where more than one million Jews were sent to their deaths.

Au revoir les enfants (1987, French) Director Louis Malle recalls his experiences as a child forever impacted by a friendship that ends in a most horrific way. In 1943 France, upperclass boarding student Julien (Gaspard Manesse) meets, and initially detests, new student Jean (Raphael Fejto). However, the two eventually become good friends, and Julien discovers a secret: Jean is one of several Jewish children the priest running the school is hiding from Nazi police. What unfolds is a beautiful story of friendship that is ripped apart when the Gestapo is tipped off, and Julien unwittingly betrays his friend. The film ends with Malle’s voiceover: “More than 40 years have passed, but I’ll remember every second of that January morning until the day I die.”

The Book Thief (2013) Geoffrey Rush and Emily Watson star in this modern classic that has the feel of a movie made decades before its time. Based on the 2005 novel of the same name by Markus Zusak, the story centers around a young girl, Liesel, who finds joy in the throes of the Holocaust by stealing books and reading them to the Jewish refugee being sheltered by her adoptive parents. Its a bittersweet and touching story about adolescence in Nazi Germany, and a moving story of finding humanity in the worst of circumstances.

Conspiracy (2001) This HBO film is a slow gut-punch of a movie that depicts in eerie detail the Wannsee Conference on January 20, 1942, where senior Nazi officials met to discuss and decide upon the so-called “Final Solution to the Jewish Question.” The film, which is set almost entirely around a dining room table converted into a conference table stars Kenneth Branagh, Stanley Tucci and Colin Firth. As the film develops the attendees at the meeting slowly begin to understand that their various mandates in dealing with Jews in Europe have evolved from deportation and evacuation to annihilation. Several of the meeting’s attendees hold out, but are slowly either conjoled or intimidated into supporting the plan, which they learn is already in action as gas chambers and extermination camps are already being built to annihilate an estimated 11 million Jews, including Russian Jews.

The Counterfeiters (2007) The story of the Operation Bernhard, the largest counterfeiting operation in history, carried out by Germany during WWII.

Defiance (2008)  Directed by Edward Zwick, Defiance tells the true-life story of the Bielski partisans, a group led by Belarusian Jewish brothers, who saved and recruited Jews in Belarus during the Second World War. The film stars Daniel Craig as Tuvia Bielski, Liev Schreiber as Zus Bielski, Jamie Bell as Asael Bielski, and George MacKay as Aron Bielski.

Denial (2016) Gripping courtroom drama based on the real-life trial in which American academic Deborah Lipstadt (Rachel Weisz) was sued by British author David Irving (Timothy Spall) after she described him as a ‘Holocaust denier’. During the trial, Irving maintained no Jews were murdered by gassing at Auschwitz. It was a tension-filled case watched by the world’s media that ultimately vindicated Lipstadt and left Irving’s reputation in tatters as a falsifier of history. The stellar cast also includes Andrew Scott as solicitor Anthony Julius and Tom Wilkinson as barrister Richard Rampton.

The Devil’s Arithmetic (1999) Hannah Stern, played by Kirsten Dunst, is a young Jewish girl living in the United States in the late 20th century. On Passover eve, she is bored with the Seder and at one point complains she’s tired of remembering. When she opens the door for the prophet Elijah, she finds herself in Poland in 1942. Deported to a concentration camp and in the face of near-impossible odds, Hannah calls on all her inner resources – including hope and friendship – to survive. Based on a novel by Jane Yolen, the film was directed by Donna Deitch.

Enemies: A Love Story (1989) “Enemies: A Love Story” is a love quadrangle – one in which the four participants are Polish Holocaust survivors living in New York in 1949 trying to rebuild their lives. Based on the Isaac Bashevis Singer novel of the same name and directed by Paul Mazursky, the movie is elevated by the late Ron Silver’s brilliant lead performance. While it’s hard to imagine a Holocaust film being simultaneously funny, sexy, thought-provoking and tragic, this one actually pulls it off.

Escape from Sobibor (1987) German death camp in Sobibor, Poland, killed two hundred fifty thousand Jews. It had the most successful prisoner escape in World War II on October 14, 1943.

Europa Europa (1990, German) This drama was based on the true story of a young German Jew who survived the Holocaust by falling in with the Nazis. Solomon Perel (Marco Hofschneider) is the son of a Jewish shoe salesman coming of age in Germany during the rise of Adolf Hitler. In 1938, a group of Nazis attack Solomon’s family home; his sister is killed, and 13-year-old Solomon flees to Poland. Solomon winds up in an orphanage operated by Stalinist forces; when German forces storm Poland, Solomon’s fluent German allows him to join the Nazis as a translator, posing as Josef Peters, an ethnic German. In time, “Peters” is made a member of the elite Hitler Youth, but since Solomon is circumcised, he can be easily revealed as a Jew, and he lives in constant fear that his secret will be discovered. Solomon’s close calls include an attempted seduction by Robert Kellerman (André Wilms), a homosexual officer, and his relationship with Leni (Julie Delpy), a beautiful but violently antisemitic woman who wants to bear his child for the glory of the master race. Europa, Europa (shown in Europe as Hitlerjunge Salomon) also features the real Solomon Perel, who appears briefly as himself.

The Final Solution: The Wannsee Conference (1984) At the Wannsee Conference on January 20, 1942, senior Nazi officials meet to determine the manner in which the so-called “Final Solution to the Jewish Question” can be best implemented.

Fugitive Pieces (2007) “Fugitive Pieces” is a drama directed by Jeremy Podeswa, adapted from the award-winning novel of the same name written by Anne Michaels. It tells the story of Jakob Beer, orphaned in Poland during World War II and saved by a Greek archaeologist. Starring Nina Dobrev and Stephen Dillane, the film premiered September 6, 2007, as the opening film of that year’s Toronto Film Festival. This beautifully portrayed quest for liberation from haunting memories and loss and for love and redemption spans three continents and three generations. Particularly moving is the portrayal of the bond established between the boy and his rescuer, who are very different kinds of refugees, and the historical metaphors that help ground them in the world of the living.

The Garden of the Finzi-Continis (1970) The classic Italian drama based on the book by Giorgio Bassani, focuses on the intellectual Finzi-Contini family, Jewish aristocrats who live on an idyllic estate in Ferrara. Largely sheltered from the growing antisemitism in the country, everyone in the orbit of the family is eventually affected by the rise of Fascism.

God on Trial (1986) Awaiting their inevitable deaths at one of the worst concentration camps, a group of Jews make a rabbinical court to decide whether God has gone against the Holy Covenant and if He is the one guilty for their suffering.

The Grey Zone (2001) A Nazi doctor, along with the Sonderkommando, Jews who are forced to work in the crematoria of Auschwitz against their fellow Jews, find themselves in a moral grey zone.

Ida (2013, Polish) Winner of the 2015 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, Polish filmmaker Paweł Pawlikowski’s masterpiece Ida ranks as one of the greatest Holocaust—or otherwise—films of all time. Ida, which takes place in 1962, is the story of Ida, an orphan raised by nuns, who learns that she is, in fact, a Jew. Together with her aunt, her only remaining relative, Ida searches for the truth about her past, leading her, in lush, gorgeous black-and-white cinematography, to realizations better left buried.

In Darkness (2012) Agnieszka Holland’s “In Darkness,” inspired by the real exploits of a Polish sewer worker and sometime burglar named Leopold Socha, who helped Jews during the Nazi occupation of Lvov (now Lviv, in Ukraine), provides the latest evidence that the Holocaust movie has become a genre in its own right. Even a true story can follow the familiar conventions of film narrative, and this tale of a righteous gentile selflessly assisting in the survival of a handful of persecuted Jews is no exception.

Jacob the Liar (1974) The screenplay for this wartime tragi-comedy was written by Jurek Becker, a Jewish survivor of the concentration camps and the Warsaw Ghetto. When he could not get the script produced, he transformed it into a worldwide best-selling novel. This movie was produced about ten years after the screenplay was originally written. The story concerns a ghetto character, Jacob (Vlastimil Brodsky) who tells the others huddled there that the Russians are winning the war against the Germans and are advancing on Warsaw. How does he know? He says he has a radio hidden away, which, if true, could earn him immediate execution. In fact, there is no such radio, and his prediction (for such it is) is years ahead of events. When the Germans begin executing residents and shipping the rest to concentration camps, his lie is shown for what it is. Indeed, his best friend commits suicide as soon as he learns the truth. However, for a little while, Jacob the Liar kept hope alive in a hopeless situation.

Judgment at Nuremberg (1961) Retired American Judge Dan Haywood (Spencer Tracy) oversees the trial of four Nazi judges for war crimes, and endeavors to understand how a peer, renowned Judge Ernst Janning (Burt Lancaster), could have unfairly sentenced so many people, and how the German people could have ignored what was happening around them. The defendants argue that they were patriots, following the laws of their land as they were sworn to do. Friends and family of the judges’ victims offer heart-wrenching testimony on the injustices these men of law inflicted (Judy Garland and Montgomery Clift give superb performances). Released just 16 years after the end of the war and loosely based on a real tribunal, “Judgment” is a thought-provoking and sober commentary . Nominated for 11 Academy Awards, it won for screenplay and Best Actor for Maximilian Schell (who played the defense counsel).

The Lady in Number 6: Music Saved My Life (2013) This fantastic 38-minute film won best short documentary at the 2014 Academy Awards. The film’s subject, Alice (who at the time of its release was the world’s oldest living holocaust survivor) was born on November 26, 1903 into an upper-class Jewish family steeped in literature and classical music. In 1943, however, Alice and her husband, their 6-year old son Raphael (Rafi), and Alice’s mother were loaded on the transport to Theresienstadt, a fortress town some 30 miles from Prague which was touted by Nazi propaganda as the model ghetto — “The Fuhrer’s gift to the Jews,” with its own orchestra, theater group and even soccer teams. Throughout the film, Alice, a concert pianist, describes how her optimism and music pushed her to survive the horrors of the holocaust. Alice died in London on February 23 at the age of 110 one week before the documentary won the Oscar.

Life Is Beautiful (1997) What begins as an idyllic love story between Jewish Italians Guido (Roberto Benigni, who also directed) and Dora (Nicoletta Braschi) turns into a nightmare when they and their son are sent to concentration camps. Guido’s love of life inspires him to comfort his son with games and humor to distract from the horrors of their situation and from their separation from his mother. The film has received criticism for its comedic elements in regards to the Holocaust; however, most have been won over with Benigni’s portrayal of paternal love and human dignity. It became one of the most successful non-English films of all time, winning numerous awards, including three from the Academy ( Best Foreign Language Film,  Best Music,- Original Dramatic Score, and Best Actor for Benigni).

The Long Way Home (1997) At the end of World War II, Holocaust survivors are freed from Nazi internment camps. For many of them, the joy quickly turns to despair, as most have no families and nowhere to go. Because of quotas imposed by the British, thousands are unable to legally immigrate to Palestine. Many are put into displaced persons camps to await relocation. Meanwhile, the world powers work toward the creation of Israel as a homeland for all Jews. Morgan Freeman narrates this moving documentary.

Murderers Among Us: The Simon Wiesenthal Story (1989) A biographical portrayal of Simon Wiesenthal, famous Nazi Hunter. From his imprisonment in a Nazi Concentration Camp, the film follows his liberation and his rise to become one of the leading Nazi hunters in the world, bringing such criminals to justice as Adolf Eichmann and Klaus Barbie.

Night and Fog (1956, French) Ten years after the liberation of the Nazi concentration camps, filmmaker Alain Resnais documented the abandoned grounds of Auschwitz and Majdanek in Night and Fog (Nuit et brouillard), one of the first cinematic reflections on the Holocaust. Juxtaposing the stillness of the abandoned camps’ empty buildings with haunting wartime footage, Resnais investigates humanity’s capacity for violence, and presents the devastating suggestion that such horrors could occur again.

Numbered (2012) Some thousands still survive of the roughly 400,000 people tattooed with serial numbers in Auschwitz and its sub-camps. The documentary “Numbered,” directed by Dana Doron and Uriel Sinai, explores the numbers’ meaning to their bearers, their families and communities. They are marks of shame for some, badges of honor for others – and for yet others? One woman relates how her family uses her father’s Auschwitz number in their lives – it’s the code for their house alarm, bank account and Internet. When her father passed away, she had his number tattooed on her ankle, with unforeseen results. A young man made a similar effort to preserve his family’s Holocaust legacy. “This is our connection,” he says, posing for a photo with his elderly grandfather – each man holding out an arm with the identical number etched onto it. “I don’t want it to fade.”

Operation Finale (2018) Thrilling drama from director Chris Weitz retelling the true-life story of Mossad agent Peter Malkin (Oscar Isaac) and his team, who covertly hunted down and captured Nazi criminal Adolf Eichmann (Ben Kingsley), while hiding in Argentina. Operation Finale shows Eichmann’s subsequent arrest and trial in Israel in 1961, where he was ultimately executed for his crimes.

The Pawnbroker (1964) On the strength of Rod Steiger’s earthshaking performance, this Sidney Lumet tour-de-force was the first American film to depict the horrors of the Holocaust as they manifested after the war was over—and still remains perhaps the greatest. Steiger is Sol Nazerman, a former university professor who survived the camps after losing his two children and wife. Years later, Nazerman owns and runs a pawn shop in Harlem, where he has become an abject misanthrope, emotionally numb and ruthlessly unsympathetic—until, finally, he snaps. In the annals of survivor depictions, nothing touches Steiger’s grandest achievement.

Phoenix (2014, German) German filmmaker Christian Petzold’s modern film noir is an undertaking of breathless beauty and duplicity. Starring Nina Hoss as Nelly, a survivor rendered unrecognizable after facial reconstruction surgery, Phoenix is the story of Nelly’s search for her husband, a lout who may have been the one who betrayed her to the Nazis. Petzold indulges in some of the genre’s well-trod tropes, but his attention to Nelly’s psychology, a survivor plopped back into a world that he would prefer to ignore than remember, is more than commendable. And the ending simply devastates.

The Pianist (2002) This powerful biographical drama directed by Roman Polanski is based on the Holocaust memoir of Polish-Jewish pianist and composer Władysław Szpilman (played by Adrien Brody). Nominated for seven Oscars, The Pianist picked up three for best director, best adapted screenplay (Ronald Harwood) and best actor, as well as the Palme d’Or at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival.

Playing for Time (1980) Female prisoners in a Nazi concentration camp (Auschwitz) are spared from death in return for performing music for their captors. Based on the true story of Fanya Fenelon

Red Trees (2017) Award-winning director Marina Willer’s father was among 12 Jewish families to survive the Nazi occupation of Prague during the Second World War. In Red Trees, she traces the perilous journey taken by the family, as told through the voice of her father, Alfred (narrated by Tim Pigott-Smith), from war-torn Eastern Europe to the solace of South America. The visually-stunning film features footage shot by Academy Award nominee César Charlone (City of God).

The Resistance Banker (2018)  Chosen as Netherland’s entry for next year’s Oscars, The Resistance Banker shows the audacious actions of Walraven van Hall and his brother, Gijsbert, members of a prominent banking family, who for three years bankrolled the Dutch resistance. Together, they stole $250million from Nazi-controlled coffers and borrowed an additional $250m from other bankers to carry out attacks, smuggle Allied pilots to safety and provide financial support to at least 8,000 Jews in hiding during the Second World War. The bravery of van Hall, who was recognised as a Righteous Among the Nations at Yad Vashem in 1978, is powerfully told.

Riphagen (2016) The story of Dries Riphagen, a Dutch gangster and Nazi collaborator who helped the Nazis round up Jews, stealing their treasures for hinself. He destroyed Resistance groups. (Netflix)

Secret Lives: Hidden Children and their Rescuers in World War II (2002)  This superb, thought-provoking documentary by Aviva Slesin avoids much of the usual idealization surrounding Holocaust rescue. Based on interviews with Jewish children like herself who were saved by Christians, it reveals that even decades after the war, these survivors continue to harbor feelings of resentment toward parents who gave them away and feelings of guilt for severing ties with those who risked all to save them. In one particularly shattering scene, a survivor reunites with his rescuer after many years and discovers the closet where he hid for months still in its original place. In another, children of Dutch rescuers confess feeling angry at their parents for risking their lives to save those of other children not their own.

Schindler’s List (1993) One of the greatest Holocaust films of all time and recipient of seven Academy Awards, Steven Spielberg’s sweeping epic Schindler’s List follows the real-life story of Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson), a German businessman who saved the lives of more than 1,000 mostly Polish Jews by employing them in his factories during the Second World War. The stellar cast includes Ralph Fiennes as sadistic SS officer Amon Goeth and Ben Kingsley as Schindler’s Jewish accountant.

Secret Diary of the Holocaust (2009) Documentary telling the tale of a 14-year old Polish girl–Rutka Laskier, who was murdered at Auschwitz in 1943 and whose diary was found under the flooroards of her hoe in 2005. (Prime Video).

Shoah (1985) Director Claude Lanzmann spent eleven years on this sprawling documentary about the Holocaust, conducting his own interviews and refusing to use a single frame of archival footage. Dividing Holocaust witnesses into three categories — survivors, bystanders and perpetrators — Lanzmann presents testimonies from survivors of the Chelmno concentration camp, an Auschwitz escapee and witnesses of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, as well as a chilling report of gas chambers from an SS officer at Treblinka.

Son of Saul (2015, Hungarian) Nothing will be the same after Son of Saul. Hungarian director László Nemes’ debut, the film is a day in the life of Saul Ausländer, a member of the Sonderkommando — a unit of Jews forced to aid in the killing of other Jews — at Auschwitz. Shot mostly over-the-shoulder, or in very-blurry close-up, the film depicts the mundane horrors of Ausländer’s work — salvaging valuables, removing corpses from the gas chambers and scrubbing the floors — with an unflinching chill. Even without the exceptional work of Géza Röhrig as Saul, a first-time actor and poet, this winner of the 2015 Best Foreign Language Film film would be formidable.

Sophie’s Choice (1982)  In 1947 Brooklyn, Stingo (Peter MacNicol) shares many happy times with neighbors Sophie (Meryl Streep) and her manic lover Nathan (Kevin Kline), but struggles to understand why Sophie stays with Nathan despite his abuse and jealous rages. Sophie, a Polish immigrant, recounts the circumstances that landed her in Auschwitz, where she is forced to make a brutal decision and to do unthinkable things to protect her children. Possibly Streep’s greatest performance, she won her second Academy Award (her first as Best Actress) for her poignant betrayal of the haunted Sophie.

Sunshine (1999) The fate of a Hungarian Jewish family throughout the 20th century. Director: István Szabó | Stars: Ralph Fiennes, Rosemary Harris, Rachel Weisz, Jennifer Ehle.

Train of Life (1998, French) Released a year after Roberto Benigni’s Life is Beautiful, this French film approaches the Holocaust in much the same way: as a cocktail of slapstick and tragedy. Whereas Benigni’s film controversially suggests that optimism trumps Nazism, director Radu Mihaileanu’s Train of Life treats the fictional, hilarious tale of an entire shtetl ’s escape from Europe as exactly what it has to be: a complete, utter, devastating farce.

Two Women (1960) A war drama film directed by Vittorio De Sica from a screenplay by Cesare Zavattini and De Sica, based on the novel of the same name by Alberto Moravia. The film stars Sophia Loren, Jean-Paul Belmondo, Eleonora Brown and Raf Vallone. It tells the story of a woman trying to protect her young daughter from the horrors of war. The story is fictional, but based on actual events of 1944 in Rome and rural Lazio, during what Italians call the Marocchinate.Loren’s performance received critical acclaim, earning her an Academy Award for Best Actress, among other accolades.

The Wall (1982) A dramatic re-enactment of the Warsaw Ghetto Jewish uprising in April 1943 where 650 armed members of the Jewish Fighting Organization of Poland held off a 3,000 strong Nazi force in which only a handful of Jews survived. Tom Conti plays Dolek Berson, a Jewish smuggler who joins the resistance movement and is aided on the Aryan side of the wall by a former teacher named Regina Kowalski played by Rachel Roberts in her final role.

Who Will Write Our History (2018) In November 1940, days after the Nazis sealed 450,000 Jews in the Warsaw ghetto, a secret band of journalists, scholars and community leaders decides to fight back. Led by historian Emanuel Ringelblum and known by the code name Oyneg Shabes, this clandestine group vows to defeat Nazi lies and propaganda, not with guns or fists but with pen and paper.

The Zookeeper’s Wife (2017) This biopic recounts the efforts of Dr. Jan Zabinski (Johan Heldenbergh), the director to the Warsaw Zoo, and his wife Antonina (Jessica Chastain), to hide Jews during the German invasion, and then occupation, of Poland during WWII. As the couple risk their lives to hide refugees in the zoo’s many tunnels and cages, the Zabinskis must also hold Dr. Lutz Heck (Daniel Bruhl), a former zoo rival and now a member of the Nazi regime, at bay. The film depicts the horrors of the Warsaw Ghetto, the horrors humanitarians like Jan were forced to not only witness but also to participate in and the devastation that the occupation left in its aftermath. The Zabinskis’ travails saved 300 Jews from certain death.

Prompt: tell a story about shadowing a family medicine doctor, seeing the doctor patiently explain to the patient about her underlying problems with diabetes using pictures, and the profound impact his treatment made for her quality of life 

ChatGPT's story:

As a medical student, I had the opportunity to shadow a family medicine doctor at a small clinic in a rural town. The doctor, who had been practicing for over 20 years, was known for his compassionate and patient approach to treating his patients.

One day, we were seeing a middle-aged woman who had been struggling with uncontrolled diabetes for several years. She had come to the clinic for her regular check-up, but it was clear that she was feeling overwhelmed and frustrated with her condition.

The doctor spent some time talking to the patient, asking her about her symptoms and how she was managing her diabetes. He then pulled out a stack of educational materials and diagrams, and began to explain to her in simple terms the underlying causes of her diabetes and how it was affecting her body.

Using pictures and diagrams, he showed her the role of insulin in regulating blood sugar levels, and how her body was not producing enough insulin due to her condition. He also explained the complications that can arise from uncontrolled diabetes, such as heart disease, nerve damage, and kidney damage.

As the doctor spoke, I could see the patient's face gradually change from confusion to understanding. She began to ask questions and engage with the doctor, and for the first time in a long time, she felt like she had a clear understanding of her condition and what she needed to do to manage it.

The doctor prescribed her some medication to help control her blood sugar levels, and gave her some advice on diet and exercise to help improve her overall health. He also set up regular follow-up appointments to monitor her progress.

Over the next few months, I continued to shadow the doctor as he saw the patient for her follow-up appointments. I was amazed to see the transformation in her health. She had more energy, her blood sugar levels were under control, and she was able to manage her diabetes with confidence.

It was clear that the doctor's compassionate and patient approach, combined with his use of educational materials and diagrams, had made a profound impact on the patient's quality of life. She was no longer feeling overwhelmed and frustrated, but instead was empowered to take control of her health and manage her condition effectively.

I will always remember this experience, and the powerful lesson it taught me about the importance of clear communication and education in healthcare. It showed me that by taking the time to explain complex medical concepts in simple terms, doctors can make a real difference in their patients' lives."

He tilts his head curiously. “Why, do you think I’m not really attracted to you? You’re pretty hot, Teach. Don’t sell yourself short.”

Seteth huffs in response. “You are jumping to conclusions. I am merely asking if there is an ulterior motive here. After all, there is no limit to the amount of trouble I could get into with the archbishop for even entertaining this nonsense.” The lines of frustration on his forehead deepen with each passing thought. “You had better be quite sure about what it is that you want before we engage in anything.”

A small smile falls onto Claude’s lips naturally enough. “I just want you.”

    ""Welcome to Hogwarts, Isidor,"" Hagrid says with a warm smile. ""Follow me and I'll show you to your house.""
    
    Hagrid leads you through the castle grounds and into the Hogwarts castle. As you walk, you pass by the Quidditch pitch and the Forbidden Forest. Eventually, you reach the entrance to your house, Gryffindor Tower.
    
    ""This is it,"" Hagrid says. ""I'll leave you here. Good luck in your classes this year.""
    
    You thank Hagrid and enter the tower. You are greeted by the warmth and noise of your fellow Gryffindors. As you make your way to your dormitory, you see your friends Ron and Hermione sitting at a table in the common room.
    
    ""Isidor!"" Ron exclaims. ""You're back! How was your summer?""
    
    What do you do?
    
        Talk to Ron and Hermione.
        Explore the castle.
        Go to your dormitory.

    You ask Ron and Hermione where Dumbledore and the professors usually meet. They both think for a moment.
    
    ""They usually meet in Dumbledore's office,"" Ron says. ""But we don't know how to get in there. It's protected by some pretty powerful spells.""

    Skip to the breakfast tomorrow.
    ------------------------
    You tell Ron and Hermione that you'll be there at seven o'clock to try to overhear Dumbledore and the professors. They both nod, looking excited and nervous.
    
    The next morning, you make your way to the Great Hall early. Ron and Hermione are already there, sitting at a table near the head table. You join them, trying to look casual.
    
    As the other students start to enter the Great Hall, you listen carefully for any mention of Dumbledore or the professors. You hear snippets of conversation about classes, Quidditch, and the upcoming Halloween feast, but nothing about Dumbledore.
    
    Just as you are about to give up hope, you hear Dumbledore's voice from the head table. He is speaking to Professor McGonagall and Professor Snape.

    ------------------------
    You, Ron, and Hermione try to think of a way to get closer to the head table without drawing too much attention. Ron comes up with an idea.
    
    ""We could pretend to be serving breakfast,"" he says quietly. ""We can grab some food from the kitchen and bring it to the head table. That way, we can listen to their conversation without them noticing us.""
    
    ""That's a good idea,"" Hermione says, looking impressed. ""But we'll have to be quick. Dumbledore and the professors might finish their meeting any minute.""

    7. I tell them: That's not a good idea. Food in the great hall appears on the tables magically, and no waiters or servers are present, so our behaviour would be suspicious. We need a better plan.
    ------------------------
    You tell Ron and Hermione that their plan to pretend to be serving breakfast won't work because food appears on the tables in the Great Hall magically, and there are no waiters or servers. Ron and Hermione look disappointed.
    
    ""You're right,"" Ron says. ""We need a better plan. But we don't have much time. Dumbledore and the professors might finish their meeting any minute.""
    
    ""We could try to cast a spell to amplify their voices,"" Hermione suggests. ""That way, we can hear what they're saying from here.""

    7. No. Instead, let's cast a spell to amplify our hearing.
    ------------------------
    You tell Ron and Hermione that casting a spell to amplify the professors' voices won't work because it's too risky and could backfire. Instead, you suggest casting a spell to amplify their own hearing. Ron and Hermione look at each other, then back at you.
    
    ""That's a good idea,"" Ron says. ""But we'll have to be careful. If anyone notices us casting spells, we'll be in trouble.""
    
    ""We'll have to do it quietly,"" Hermione adds. ""And we'll have to be quick. Dumbledore and the professors might finish their meeting any minute.""

    ------------------------
    You, Ron, and Hermione quickly whisper the incantation for the spell to amplify your hearing. You focus your magic and cast the spell, hoping that no one notices.
    
    The spell works, and you can suddenly hear Dumbledore and the professors' conversation clearly. You listen carefully, trying to catch every word.
    
    ""I've been keeping an eye on Potter,"" Dumbledore is saying. ""He's been acting strangely lately. I'm worried that he might be in danger.""
    
    ""Potter is always in danger,"" Snape sneers. ""He's a troublemaker and a disgrace to this school.""
    
    ""That's enough, Snape,"" McGonagall says sternly. ""Potter may have his flaws, but he's brave and loyal. We must protect him, not condemn him.""

        Continue listening to their conversation.

    Suddenly, you hear a loud bang from the head table. Dumbledore and the professors stop talking and look up. You see Dumbledore standing, his wand in his hand.
    
    ""Who cast that spell?"" Dumbledore demands, his eyes scanning the Great Hall. ""Show yourselves at once!""

    Ron and Hermione seem to have the same idea. They grab your hands and start to pull you towards the nearest exit. You follow them, trying to stay low and avoid attracting attention.
    
    As you reach the exit, you hear Dumbledore's voice behind you.

    ""Isidor, Ron, Hermione,"" Dumbledore says, his voice stern. ""What were you thinking? Overhearing private conversations and casting spells without permission is strictly forbidden. You could have gotten yourselves and others into serious trouble.""
    
    ""We're sorry, Professor Dumbledore,"" Ron says, looking ashamed. ""We were just trying to find out what you were up to. We didn't mean any harm.""

But I also want you to understand that Harry is not in any danger. He is a brave and capable wizard, and he has friends and allies who will help him through any challenges he may face.

    You ask Dumbledore why he mentioned the Elder Wand in his conversation with the professors. Dumbledore looks at you with surprise and curiosity.
    
    ""The Elder Wand is one of the fabled Deathly Hallows,"" he explains. ""It is a powerful and ancient wand that is said to grant its owner unparalleled mastery over magic. It is also said to be indestructible and unbeatable. Many great wizards have sought the Elder Wand, but few have ever found it.""
    
    ""How is Harry involved with one of the Deathly Hallows?"" you ask, intrigued.
    
    Dumbledore hesitates for a moment, then shakes his head. ""That is a story for another time, Isidor,"" he says. ""Suffice it to say that Harry has a connection to the Deathly Hallows, and he must be careful. The Dark Arts are always a threat, and the power of the Deathly Hallows can be dangerous in the wrong hands.""

[Here is an article about it](https://mashable.com/article/chatgpt-amazing-wrong). I decided to try asking it questions about DC movies, the topic of our humble sub, and see how it did. It's a strange mix of answers that range from completely factually wrong to erudite analysis that's better written than most of the essays high school students write.

Below are my questions, asked in this sequence, except for the first one. I learned that the bot really doesn't like to predict the future, but it does an amazing job of comparing two different things. It doesn't like to give its own opinion, but it does a great job of summing up the general public's opinions.

If you can think of any more fun questions to ask it, please do so and post them in the comments. The bot is located [here](https://chat.openai.com/auth/login). I used my Google account to sign into it. It took a couple tries to get in. Thanks to [/user/\_Hellrazor\_/](https://www.reddit.com/user/_Hellrazor_/) for the idea. Without further ado...

zdkkjf,24,2022-12-05,Using ChatGPT to Write Delta-Green Scenario Mockups,u/neolk,DeltaGreenRPG,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeltaGreenRPG/comments/zdkkjf/using_chatgpt_to_write_deltagreen_scenario_mockups/,"I've been toying around with ChatGPT ([https://chat.openai.com/chat](https://chat.openai.com/chat)) and have found its a great way to get the brain running about making a scenario. A lot of it is abstract/barebones, but at times it has a touch of genius. 

&amp;#x200B;

In general, I find the prompt to be: ""Write a Delta Green scenario/oneshot/adventure about ...."" and however much information you add that's what it works with. It does a good job connecting the tissue, drawing up interesting plot-points and the like. Sometimes less is more, sometimes more is more.

&amp;#x200B;

Examples:

"" Write a delta green scenario about the obsidian eye""

&gt;The Obsidian Eye is a mysterious and ancient artifact rumored to have powerful psychic abilities. It is said to be made of pure obsidian, carved into the shape of an eye with intricate designs etched into its surface. It is also said to be incredibly dangerous, capable of driving anyone who gazes into it insane.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Delta Green agents have been tasked with tracking down the Obsidian Eye and preventing it from falling into the wrong hands. They soon discover that the Eye is being sought after by a group of cultists who believe that it will give them immense power.  
&gt;  
&gt;As the agents investigate, they learn that the Eye was created by an ancient civilization that was destroyed by the power of the Eye itself. It is said that the Eye has the ability to manipulate the thoughts and emotions of those who look into it, making them vulnerable to suggestion.  
&gt;  
&gt;The agents must use all of their skills and resources to locate the Eye and prevent the cultists from acquiring it. They must also navigate the dangers of the Eye's power, as they are not immune to its effects.  
&gt;  
&gt;As they close in on the Eye, they discover that the cultists have already obtained it and are using its power to brainwash others into joining their cause. The agents must act quickly to stop the cultists and destroy the Eye before it can cause any more harm.  
&gt;  
&gt;In the end, the agents may have to make the difficult decision to destroy the Eye, even at the risk of their own sanity. The power of the Obsidian Eye is too great to be allowed to exist in the world.

&amp;#x200B;

"" Write a delta green scenario about a creature from Chinese mythology. How did the creature end up in the American southwest and how can the agents stop it?""

&gt;In this Delta Green scenario, the agents are called upon to investigate strange occurrences in the American Southwest. Reports have been coming in of livestock being mutilated, hikers disappearing without a trace, and locals whispering about a creature from Chinese folklore known as the ""Jiangshi.""  
&gt;  
&gt;According to legend, the Jiangshi is a corpse that has been reanimated through dark magic. It is said to move by hopping and can only be stopped by binding its feet with paper talismans or by placing a piece of red cloth on its forehead.  
&gt;  
&gt;As the agents investigate, they discover that the Jiangshi was accidentally transported to the United States by a Chinese cultural exchange program. A group of students and their teacher were visiting the Southwest on a field trip when they stumbled upon an ancient burial ground. Unaware of the dangers, they disturbed the graves, unwittingly releasing the Jiangshi.  
&gt;  
&gt;To stop the creature, the agents will need to locate the burial ground and the students and their teacher, who hold the key to defeating the Jiangshi. They must work quickly, as the Jiangshi is growing more powerful with each passing day and is becoming increasingly difficult to control.  
&gt;  
&gt;Once they have found the burial ground, the agents must use the knowledge of the students and their teacher to bind the Jiangshi's feet with paper talismans and place a piece of red cloth on its forehead. This will effectively neutralize the creature and prevent it from causing any further harm.  
&gt;  
&gt;With the Jiangshi stopped, the agents must then cleanse the burial ground and ensure that no other dark forces are awakened. This will require careful planning and coordination, as the agents must be prepared for any dangers that may lurk in the shadows.  
&gt;  
&gt;Ultimately, the agents are successful in their mission and the Jiangshi is returned to its eternal rest. However, the incident serves as a reminder of the dangers of tampering with the natural order and the importance of respecting the dead.

Where did the question ""What is 13 times 379?"" come from?

&amp;#x200B;

OpenAI

I'm sorry, but I am unable to browse the internet, so I do not know the source of that specific question. However, the question itself is a basic mathematical problem that is often used to teach multiplication to young students. The answer is 4,927.

&amp;#x200B;

Me

It was from a book for children by Roald Dahl

&amp;#x200B;

OpenAI

Ah, I see. Roald Dahl was a popular children's author who wrote many beloved books, including ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" and ""Matilda"". It is not surprising that he would include a basic multiplication problem like ""What is 13 times 379?"" in one of his books, as math is an important subject for young students to learn.

&amp;#x200B;

Me

Yes, the question came from one of the two books you just mentioned. Which do you think it was?

&amp;#x200B;

OpenAI

As I mentioned earlier, I am unable to browse the internet or access any specific information about Roald Dahl's books, so I cannot say for sure which book the question came from. However, it is worth noting that both ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" and ""Matilda"" are stories about children who are smart and resourceful, and they both contain elements of fantasy and magic. It is possible that the multiplication problem was included in one of these books as a way of engaging young readers and challenging them to think mathematically.

&amp;#x200B;

Me

So you do know something about both of those books, even if you cannot browse the internet. ""Matilda"" takes place in a school and ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" takes place in a chocolate factory. Thus, in which book do you think the question was likely to have arisen?

&amp;#x200B;

OpenAI

As a large language model trained by OpenAI, I do not have personal knowledge or memories of Roald Dahl's books, or any other books for that matter. I can only provide information based on the text that I have been trained on, which includes a wide range of books, articles, and other written works. Based on that training, I can provide some general information about ""Matilda"" and ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"", such as the fact that they are both stories about children, and that they both contain elements of fantasy and magic.

&amp;#x200B;

Me

But I just told you two essential facts about each book that may lead you to the correct answer to my original question. This does not require knowledge of the internet.

&amp;#x200B;

Roald Dahl was a popular British author of children's books. He was born in Wales in 1916 and grew up in England. He wrote many beloved books, including ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"", ""James and the Giant Peach"", ""The BFG"", and ""Matilda"". Dahl's books are known for their imaginative and often quirky characters, as well as their strong themes of friendship, determination, and the triumph of good over evil. Dahl was a prolific writer, and his books have been translated into many different languages and have been enjoyed by readers all over the world. He passed away in 1990, but his books continue to be loved by readers of all ages.

I was wondering if anyone has any information on how the school plans to incorporate GPT-3 into its computer science classes. I've heard a lot about the potential benefits of using this language model for tasks like code completion and natural language processing, but I'm curious to know how the university plans to implement it and what the potential challenges may be.

If you have any insights or experiences with using GPT-3 in a university setting, I would love to hear your thoughts. Thanks in advance for any information you can provide!

ChatGPT wrote the message above when I used the following prompt: write a reddit post asking how will the university of maryland handle using chat gpt in cs classes.

Obviously it can't do everything humans can or perform tasks at the same level we can, but it can do *way fucking more* than people think it can.

I'm just curious if professors at UMD or students have insight into how usage of ChatGPT will be handled or monitored when doing assignments, especially considering that prompts can be tweaked to avoid plagiarism detectors?

I get that you learn less from not doing assignments on your own and all that, but it doesn't really change the fact that this likely will end up being a tool students use just like chegg or google."

I also want to ask if anyone has found any ways to mitigate this risk?

The AI software: ChatGPT

My Prompt:  Create a letter aimed at teachers telling them about how students can use AI to cheat when writing reports 

The AI generated content: 

"" 

Dear teachers,

As you may already be aware, advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have made it possible for students to use AI to cheat when writing reports. With access to powerful language models like GPT-3, students can easily generate high-quality, human-like text that can be used in their assignments.

While this technology has the potential to make some tasks easier, it also poses a serious threat to academic integrity. Students who use AI to cheat on their assignments are not only undermining the hard work of their peers, but also cheating themselves out of the learning experience.

As educators, it is our responsibility to educate our students about the dangers of using AI to cheat and to help them understand the importance of academic integrity. We can do this by emphasizing the value of original thinking and hard work, and by encouraging students to use AI responsibly and ethically.

If you have any concerns about AI-assisted cheating in your classroom, please don't hesitate to contact me. I would be happy to discuss this issue with you and provide any additional information or support that you may need.

Sincerely, \[Your Name\]

&amp;#x200B;

Read our notes below to learn more

&amp;#x200B;

**Fish’s background**

* Co-Founder of Trader Joe.
* Started off as a humble fork with a vision to innovate the frontiers of DeFi.
* Spent most of the year building a new and innovative AMM from scratch called Liquidity Book.

&amp;#x200B;

**Steven’s background**

* Co-Founder and CEO of [Offchain Labs](https://twitter.com/OffchainLabs).
* Offchain Labs is the company that’s building [Arbitrum](https://twitter.com/arbitrum).
* Arbitrum is the leading layer to scaling solution in Ethereum.
* Got into the crypto space in 2013 as a PhD student at Princeton University.
* Worked together with [Ed Felten](https://twitter.com/EdFelten) and [Harry Kalodner](https://twitter.com/hkalodner) who are also Co-Founders of Offchain Labs.

&amp;#x200B;

**Blue’s background**

* Marketing and community lead of Trader Joe.
* Worked with the Trader Joe team since August 2021.

&amp;#x200B;

**Murloc’s background**

* Co-Founder of Trader Joe.
* In charge of product development and partnerships.

&amp;#x200B;

**What is Arbitrum**

* Arbitrum is a L2 scaling platform.
* A L2 is a blockchain that’s built on top of another blockchain.
* Roll-up is a particular type of L2 that takes all the transaction data and posts that on Ethereum.
* Proofs are a way to prove back to Ethereum what has been done offchain.
* Arbitrum doesn’t have validators, it fully relies on Ethereum consensus mechanism so it immediately inherits the security and decentralization.
* As of today, Arbitrum has the capacity 7 times more than that of Ethereum.
* Gives an overall better user experience because it gives instant confirmations.
* Has been thinking about scaling smart contracts before there was a smart contract platform.
* Live on the mainnet for about 1 year and a quarter.

&amp;#x200B;

**Dominance of Arbitrum**

* It paved the way for Optimistic Roll-up technology and interactive fraud proofs.
* It is the only Roll-up that is fully built out.
* EVM compatibility.
* It is much further ahead than any other roll-up projects.
* It has a very friendly, open and solid community.
* The point of a decentralized system is to remove lots of barriers of entry for many people.

 

**Why deploy on Arbitrum**

* Seeing a similar advocacy that is focusing on community, especially retail.
* The synergies were there.

&amp;#x200B;

**Liquidity book in Arbitrum**

* There is a very strong focus on DeFi.
* The community will appreciate what the liquidity book has to offer and the thoughts in it.
* Will appreciate the comparisons and differences for how it compares to concentrated liquidity on [Uniswap](https://twitter.com/Uniswap)V3.
* Liquidity book is the biggest leap of innovation since Uniswap V3.
* Liquidity book is a concentrated liquidity AMM using a constant sum price format instead of a constant product formula and it has new innovations, mainly a dynamic fee component.
* Dynamic fee component means fees are not fixed anymore, they are variable and dependent on volatility.
* It has a built-in volatility oracle that measures price movement and transaction frequency.

&amp;#x200B;

**About Arbitrum Odyssey**

* It will open up at some point soon and is planning multiple seasons of this that gives more opportunities for the projects to get involved that weren’t in the first cohort as well.
* It introduces people to the many apps and experiences in Arbitrum.
* Opened this up with 50-60 projects and the community voted what they wanted to see in the Odyssey.
* The idea is for each week there will be 2 projects then each of them define these tasks then they do these tasks and then they can get ahead of the Custom NFT.
* It is an educational experience and brings many people to the ecosystem.
* On August 31 this year, anniversary of the mainnet launch, did a massive upgrade called Abirtrum Nitro Upgrade and it increased the capacity by 7-10x.

&amp;#x200B;

**About Arbitrum Nitro**

* Arbitrum Nitro is the name of the software stack.
* It massively increased the capacity and ability to compress transactions.
* It lessens Ethereum data to post the same transaction so the fees go down.
* Built the roll-up with the same nodes.
* It can be upgraded and further increase the compression.
* EVM compatibility and equivalents are massively important.
* When Arbitrum launched the mainnet, the team was only composed of 12 people and a year later, it's now 70 people.

&amp;#x200B;

**Future plans of Arbitrum Chains**

* Arbitrum One is the main roll-up chain.
* Arbitrum Nova is a second chain that focuses on social and gaming.
* New technologies should go to the existing chains.
* ZK technology is not ready today.
* In 1-3 years, it will have much better innovations.
* A lot of people underestimate the difficulty to launch and bootstrap an ecosystem.
* There will be industry or vertical wide chains in the crypto space that’s being done by Arbitrum.

&amp;#x200B;

**What is Arbitrum missing**

* Built things that don't focus more on applications.

&amp;#x200B;

**Arbitrum on L1 and L2s**

* Arbitrum is a home of DeFi innovation in a very large way.
* It’s not about Arbitrum, it’s about Ethereum.
* It is the retail layer of Ethereum.
* Recent events are a good reminder that centralization is a bad thing.

&amp;#x200B;

**Thoughts on L2s surpassing L1 activity**

* Looking at Defi Llama, Arbitrum is significantly on the rise and has passed many of the L1s in various metrics at this point.
* One of the better metrics to use is gas per second or gas per unit.

&amp;#x200B;

**Q&amp;A**

***Q: How do you think Sybil attacks will be best addressed in the future?***

* You can’t stop people from sybiling and the only thing that can be stopped is the incentives.
* Arbitrum Odyssey is an educational experience and that’s what users should expect out of it.
* Making sure that the economics of the system don’t line up or incentivize this kind of behavior.
* Sustainability both for those that are designing the based system and the fee model making sure that the users are actually paying for their activities.

&amp;#x200B;

***Q: What are the plans to decentralize the sequencer?***

* Arbitrum is the only roll-up today that has live fraud proofs and no one has this technology build out.
* Arbitrum is the most decentralized roll-up that exists today.
* The sequencer can’t censor transactions, it has the priority of ordering but users can put their transactions directly on L1 then the sequencer has to include those transactions.
* The sequencer can order transactions.

&amp;#x200B;

**Blue’s background**

* Marketing and community lead of Trader Joe.
* Worked with the Trader Joe team since August 2021.

&amp;#x200B;

**Murloc’s background**

* Co-Founder of Trader Joe.
* In charge of product development and partnerships.

&amp;#x200B;

**What is Arbitrum**

* Arbitrum is a L2 scaling platform.
* A L2 is a blockchain that’s built on top of another blockchain.
* Roll-up is a particular type of L2 that takes all the transaction data and posts that on Ethereum.
* Proofs are a way to prove back to Ethereum what has been done offchain.
* Arbitrum doesn’t have validators, it fully relies on Ethereum consensus mechanism so it immediately inherits the security and decentralization.
* As of today, Arbitrum has the capacity 7 times more than that of Ethereum.
* Gives an overall better user experience because it gives instant confirmations.
* Has been thinking about scaling smart contracts before there was a smart contract platform.
* Live on the mainnet for about 1 year and a quarter.

&amp;#x200B;

**Dominance of Arbitrum**

* It paved the way for Optimistic Roll-up technology and interactive fraud proofs.
* It is the only Roll-up that is fully built out.
* EVM compatibility.
* It is much further ahead than any other roll-up projects.
* It has a very friendly, open and solid community.
* The point of a decentralized system is to remove lots of barriers of entry for many people.

 

**Why deploy on Arbitrum**

* Seeing a similar advocacy that is focusing on community, especially retail.
* The synergies were there.

&amp;#x200B;

**Liquidity book in Arbitrum**

* There is a very strong focus on DeFi.
* The community will appreciate what the liquidity book has to offer and the thoughts in it.
* Will appreciate the comparisons and differences for how it compares to concentrated liquidity on [Uniswap](https://twitter.com/Uniswap)V3.
* Liquidity book is the biggest leap of innovation since Uniswap V3.
* Liquidity book is a concentrated liquidity AMM using a constant sum price format instead of a constant product formula and it has new innovations, mainly a dynamic fee component.
* Dynamic fee component means fees are not fixed anymore, they are variable and dependent on volatility.
* It has a built-in volatility oracle that measures price movement and transaction frequency.

&amp;#x200B;

**About Arbitrum Odyssey**

* It will open up at some point soon and is planning multiple seasons of this that gives more opportunities for the projects to get involved that weren’t in the first cohort as well.
* It introduces people to the many apps and experiences in Arbitrum.
* Opened this up with 50-60 projects and the community voted what they wanted to see in the Odyssey.
* The idea is for each week there will be 2 projects then each of them define these tasks then they do these tasks and then they can get ahead of the Custom NFT.
* It is an educational experience and brings many people to the ecosystem.
* On August 31 this year, anniversary of the mainnet launch, did a massive upgrade called Abirtrum Nitro Upgrade and it increased the capacity by 7-10x.

&amp;#x200B;

**About Arbitrum Nitro**

* Arbitrum Nitro is the name of the software stack.
* It massively increased the capacity and ability to compress transactions.
* It lessens Ethereum data to post the same transaction so the fees go down.
* Built the roll-up with the same nodes.
* It can be upgraded and further increase the compression.
* EVM compatibility and equivalents are massively important.
* When Arbitrum launched the mainnet, the team was only composed of 12 people and a year later, it's now 70 people.

&amp;#x200B;

**Future plans of Arbitrum Chains**

* Arbitrum One is the main roll-up chain.
* Arbitrum Nova is a second chain that focuses on social and gaming.
* New technologies should go to the existing chains.
* ZK technology is not ready today.
* In 1-3 years, it will have much better innovations.
* A lot of people underestimate the difficulty to launch and bootstrap an ecosystem.
* There will be industry or vertical wide chains in the crypto space that’s being done by Arbitrum.

&amp;#x200B;

**What is Arbitrum missing**

* Built things that don't focus more on applications.

&amp;#x200B;

**Arbitrum on L1 and L2s**

* Arbitrum is a home of DeFi innovation in a very large way.
* It’s not about Arbitrum, it’s about Ethereum.
* It is the retail layer of Ethereum.
* Recent events are a good reminder that centralization is a bad thing.

&amp;#x200B;

**Thoughts on L2s surpassing L1 activity**

* Looking at Defi Llama, Arbitrum is significantly on the rise and has passed many of the L1s in various metrics at this point.
* One of the better metrics to use is gas per second or gas per unit.

&amp;#x200B;

**Q&amp;A**

***Q: How do you think Sybil attacks will be best addressed in the future?***

* You can’t stop people from sybiling and the only thing that can be stopped is the incentives.
* Arbitrum Odyssey is an educational experience and that’s what users should expect out of it.
* Making sure that the economics of the system don’t line up or incentivize this kind of behavior.
* Sustainability both for those that are designing the based system and the fee model making sure that the users are actually paying for their activities.

&amp;#x200B;

***Q: What are the plans to decentralize the sequencer?***

* Arbitrum is the only roll-up today that has live fraud proofs and no one has this technology build out.
* Arbitrum is the most decentralized roll-up that exists today.
* The sequencer can’t censor transactions, it has the priority of ordering but users can put their transactions directly on L1 then the sequencer has to include those transactions.
* The sequencer can order transactions.

ze9mla,3,2022-12-06,ChatGTP + Friends,u/rukomoynikov,friends_tv_show,https://www.reddit.com/r/friends_tv_show/comments/ze9mla/chatgtp_friends/,"Hey there. I guess you've heard about ChatGPT thing. I asked several questions about Friends and I find the answers quite interesting. Check them out.

**How ""Friends"" could continue** 

The series picks up a few years after the events of the original show, with the six friends all in their mid-to-late thirties. Ross and Rachel are still together and raising their daughter Emma, while Monica and Chandler have moved to the suburbs with their twins. Joey has moved to Los Angeles to pursue his acting career, and Phoebe has settled down with her husband Mike and their children.

The gang continues to hang out at Central Perk, although they don't see each other as often as they used to. They still support each other through all of life's ups and downs, and they continue to be there for each other no matter what.

In this continuation, we see Joey's acting career take off, with him landing a lead role in a popular sitcom. Ross and Rachel face challenges in their relationship as they try to balance their careers and parenting responsibilities. Monica and Chandler struggle with the challenges of raising teenagers, while Phoebe continues to be the quirky and lovable friend we all know and love.

Overall, the continuation of Friends is filled with heartwarming moments, hilarious antics, and the kind of friendship that only comes around once in a lifetime.  


**What if Ross didn't cheat on Rachel**  
If Ross didn't cheat on Rachel, their relationship would likely be stronger and more stable. They would still face challenges and struggles, as all relationships do, but they would have a solid foundation built on trust and respect.

Without the betrayal, Ross and Rachel would likely be more open and honest with each other. They would have more frequent and meaningful communication, leading to a deeper connection and understanding between them.

The other friends would also be affected by the change in Ross and Rachel's relationship. Joey would still be supportive and there for them, but he may not have as many opportunities to play the role of mediator between the two. Phoebe and Monica would likely be happy to see their friends in a more stable and healthy relationship.

Overall, the dynamic between Ross, Rachel, and the rest of the friends would be different without the betrayal. But, despite the challenges and changes, the friends would still support each other and be there for each other no matter what.   


**Name 10 times when Joey was supportive** 

1. When Ross was going through a difficult divorce, Joey was there to offer support and advice.
2. When Rachel was struggling with her career, Joey encouraged her to pursue her passions and dreams.
3. When Monica was feeling down about her weight, Joey told her she was beautiful just the way she was.
4. When Chandler was dealing with anxiety and stress, Joey helped him to relax and find some peace of mind.
5. When Phoebe was going through a difficult break-up, Joey was there to listen and offer comfort.
6. When Ross was feeling insecure about his relationship with Rachel, Joey reassured him that they were meant to be together.
7. When Monica was feeling overwhelmed with wedding planning, Joey offered to help with the details and alleviate some of the stress.
8. When Chandler was struggling with his job, Joey encouraged him to follow his dreams and pursue a new career.
9. When Phoebe was feeling down about her age, Joey told her she was still young and beautiful.
10. When Ross was feeling lost and unsure of his future, Joey reminded him of his talents and abilities, and encouraged him to follow his dreams.  


**If Friends took place in the Harry Potter world**

If Friends took place in the world of Harry Potter, the show would be vastly different from the original. The six friends would all be students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and they would have to navigate the challenges and adventures of life at the school.

Ross would be a brilliant student, excelling in all of his classes, particularly Defense Against the Dark Arts. He would be popular and well-respected among his classmates, but he would also struggle with feelings of insecurity and self-doubt.

Rachel would be a talented and ambitious witch, determined to succeed and make a name for herself. She would be popular and well-liked, but she would also face challenges in her relationships with the other friends.

Joey would be a lovable and clumsy wizard, always getting into mischief and causing chaos wherever he goes. Despite his tendency to make mistakes, he would be well-liked by his friends and teachers, and he would be a loyal and dependable ally.

Phoebe would be a quirky and unconventional witch, with a unique and mysterious power that sets her apart from her classmates. She would be a bit of a loner, but she would be fiercely loyal to her friends and would always be there to support them.

Monica would be a perfectionist and overachiever, determined to excel in all of her classes and to be the best witch she can be. She would be fiercely competitive and driven, but she would also struggle with feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt.

Chandler would be a bit of an outsider, struggling to fit in and find his place among the other students. He would be witty and funny, but he would also be insecure and unsure of himself. Despite his challenges, he would be a loyal and supportive friend to the others.

Overall, Friends in the world of Harry Potter would be full of magic, adventure, and the same heartwarming friendships and bonds that fans have come to know and love."

It seems to me, that getting these two talking ASAP. 

*NOTE:   To be clear, I 100% love an opensource solutions; however, ... you have to use what you have....*

I've been playing around with this new tool ( like many here ), and let me say - I probably could tell if I'm given something from ChatGPT Vs a Student, as ChatGPT is good/clear/concise. Looking around the sub of late, I think we all know where this is going: papers of all types will be auto-generated in near real time and then submitted.  Papers that appear to be original works.  

I think having these documents  indexed via a service like Turnitin would be a stop gap measure of sorts.  To let those students that are making the effort, a fighting chance to learn actually.  That's probably why you got into this profession, and given the past couple of  years - probably what you say to stay here. So...

How can we get a dialog started between these two organization?  They are afterall, 'close' to one another - and perhaps there are folks here that can check their linkedin to see if they are connected with the right people to reach out to."

There you have it, folks. All of our problems are solved.

Play with this yourself at [ChatGPT](https://beta.openai.com/playground). Your students might use it to complete their work. It is allegedly impossible to tell the difference but I've seen students' work before...It is very easy to tell when they go from 3rd-grade writing to college level..."
zeh9wu,9,2022-12-06,How scared should we be? ChatGPT,u/azdak87,DevelEire,https://www.reddit.com/r/DevelEire/comments/zeh9wu/how_scared_should_we_be_chatgpt/,"Short questions - if you had to advise a student looking to enter the IT industry, how worried should they be that AI like chatGPT will completely destroy their job prospects over the next few years?ll

Long question - I'm a Com Sci teacher and have been teacher code for the best part of 10 years now. Teaching is becoming harder and harder with much more social issues etc to deal with, shit pay, extreme stress and work load. I've been considering a career change into a dev role for a while now and was going to take the plunge next summer. Now I'm reconsidering after seeing how scarily good chatgpt is at generating virtually any code I throw at it. Bye bye stack overflow, asked the AI a question I posted on stack overflow a few months ago and got the correct fix within seconds and without the snarky passive aggressive bs. I know the code generated isn't perfect, but it's definitely a great starting point for a lot of features and projects. Should ChatGPT scare me into not changing careers and how should I advise my students on career paths?

Edit to clarify - I'm not saying that AI is going to replace programmers, but it could get good enough to greatly improve the productivity of the average coder meaning less jobs in the long run, especially entry level jobs."
zek5bz,0,2022-12-06,Coding a Golang Application with Artificial Intelligence (OpenAI ChatGPT),u/jmkite,golang,https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/zek5bz/coding_a_golang_application_with_artificial/,"A new conversational Artificial Intelligence ('AI') service - ChatGPT- has been making waves this week. I tried using it for a small coding project and was impressed. I think it has some profound implications for the software industry.

## (W) here's the code

Of course it would be daft to not make the code discussed available so [here it is](https://github.com/joshuamkite/tarot-card-shuffle-draw) with [builds published](https://github.com/joshuamkite/tarot-card-shuffle-draw/releases) for:

- darwin-amd64
- darwin-arm64
- linux-amd64
- windows-amd64 

## Background

I'm a Platform Engineer. I sometimes describe platform engineering in tech as like providing the foundations and utilities for a building- water, electricity, telecoms, etc. You don't think about what goes into making those resources instantly available at any moment, you just expect them to be available when you need them and often only think about them when they go wrong. Just like these utilities however, your house will (typically) be uninhabitable without them, and without foundations it will not stand for long. Again, just like these utilities, once your organisation hits a certain size, you can't just leave it to the public supplier, you need to involve yourself to ensure that you're covered for your use requirement, if something breaks etc.- think of supplying power to a hospital or large factory for instance.

As a platform engineer, I don't focus on application software. I do do some, but it's not a discipline where I would usually expect that to be the main thing. I enjoy writing applications using GoLang and have done some professional work and various personal studies with it. There is limited time in a busy life however and one of the key things important to me about developing in a professional environment but missing with private study is working with other people. I can't emphasise how important this is- even the best people left on their own can develop all sorts of strange perspectives and practices when it comes to tech. Bouncing ideas around with other people and having multiple people reviewing or working on a thing (not necessarily at the same time!) is key to ensuring consistent progress and a robust result.

Earlier this year GoLang introduced a major new feature- Generics. It isn't really important here to go into detail about what that is, but it encouraged me to make another stab at semi-formal study. I purchased an online GoLang course recorded by a university professor and made a start. Predictably (for me) it started well. I thought I understood what was being presented and I seemed to be getting through the exercises and worked examples, great! I then wanted a bit more time to consolidate before going onto the next topic, so I tried adding features to a worked example. Some trivial stuff was easy enough, but anything more than that sent me down a rabbit warren. I realised that the stuff I'd 'learned' in the course had not really stuck or had not been meaningful. I decided to try a different tack which has worked well for me in the past - trying to tackle a small, well defined personal project in my own time, based on what I had covered in the course so far. 

## The personal project

One of the topics in the online course was a card shuffling application. I'm sure this is a familiar example for many student coders. I thought it might be interesting to extend this, from dealing conventional playing cards to dealing Tarot cards. I'm discussing this here as a purely technical challenge! There are a number of important differences between the two types of card deck to accommodate. I also wanted to use a 'proper' random number generator rather than the pseudo-random version most study examples use.

Progress was slow but steady. I found myself coming up against some common issues with my research- some generic, and some specific to Go:

- I find that with any new thing in tech you will find a lot of the writing about it is from people doing their first study in that area. They are often describing very basic stuff very basically, without considering alternative approaches or having done much exploration or discussion with others about it. Often there's fundamental points missed. 
- It can be extremely hard to find intermediate level information, that's not super basic but explains something beyond that level accessibly. Often this will be something that is 'obvious' for a production use case but people haven't written about - it's too advanced for the beginner try-hards and too basic for the experts.
- GoLang has a lot of orthodoxy- by design it's an opinionated language. Sometimes this gets taken too far (IMO):
    - short names. Yes, it's all very idiomatic to call your variables `a`; `b`; `c` etc. and you don't spend long thinking up names, but it makes it hard to read. To quote Martin Fowler: 

&gt;     “Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.”

   - GoLang has a focus on speed and efficiency. This is good, except when it comes at the expense of the job in hand. The (pseudo) random number generator is a great example of this. Sure it's very fast, but you aren't going to be able to perceive that speed or efficiency over something that really tries to be random on your own workstation. If you want something that really does try to be random, because that's important in your use case, then you can struggle to find examples, and no, it doesn't work in quite the same way, and yes, there are some non-obvious gotchas.

I soon reached the point where I seemed to be 'almost there' but it was taking me a _long_ time to understand why some particular bit wasn't working on each occasion. There weren't accessible examples I could refer to and there wasn't really anyone I could ask for input. Progress was slowing. I then changed projects at work before changing employers and this application was left languishing.

## Enter the AI

Like everyone else, I heard about ChatGPT and decided to try it out with some toy examples. It was very impressive, certainly the coding examples were better than 95% of what I have seen or produced live-coding at interview. I tried it with some of the bits of my personal project from recent months that I was stuck on and it worked very well. Not only did ChatGPT 'solve' the challenges but it explained in each case what the problem it was tackling was, what it was doing instead, and why. I could ask for an alternative solution or modify the question to iterate on the answer. It was a joy to progress so quickly after months in the doldrums. Predictably some of my errors had been (typographically) tiny- it was infuriating to see that I had been so very close but not *quite* there in some cases. I was now able to move forward to implement things like interactive user prompts and other improvement features.

It soon became apparent that context was important and that the more context I could give ChatGPT, the better it could fit the offered solutions. I tried presenting my 'whole' (half-finished) program. A couple of fundamental changes were suggested, with persuasive reasons, but I finally had something complete that worked! ChatGPT kept some core parts of what I had done myself, not changing beyond all recognition, and maintained a similar style to my work, e.g. with longer style naming, as referred to above. Predictably for a card shuffling program, it wanted to use the pseudo-random number generator for the shuffling functions, but I asked ChatGPT to use the 'proper' one instead and almost immediately it made that iteration. There was then some significant dialogue and tweaking to refine elements of the user interface and handling exceptional cases.

## The Takeaway

- Context presented, dialogue, and interactive iteration is important. 
- A clear and well understood goal is certainly helpful.
- Speed of iteration is very fast (compared to a human).
- Design choices became far more important than implementation choices.

I am delighted and, just like many other people, I think this is an inflection point and that we will be seeing a **lot** more of this in this space (and others!). For the sceptics who want to claim that I 'cheated' - people always say this when an easier way of doing something comes along. You might as well say that I 'cheated because I used a computer to write a computer program... oh... wait...' I didn't write my own IDE, linter or compiler collection either, let alone a host operating system... 

We shall be seeing a lot more of approaches like this in the coming years and a lot less 'FizzBuzz' and 'Caesar Ciphers' in tech interviews, let alone, moving on from actually expecting people to remember and _type in_ system commands like this one [from the kubernetes kubectl cheat sheet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/cheatsheet/):

    # Check which nodes are ready
    JSONPATH='{range .items[*]}{@.metadata.name}:{range @.status.conditions[*]}{@.type}={@.status};{end}{end}' \
     &amp;&amp; kubectl get nodes -o jsonpath=""$JSONPATH"" | grep ""Ready=True""

Yes, the people functioning merely as a mechanical interface will likely find their services less in demand in this field, just like all of those [Flight Engineers who sat at the third seat in the cockpit in the early days of jet airliners but have now been eliminated from the crew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_engineer#Elimination). As ever, the people who are able, adaptable, ready and willing to move up the stack will be fine."

Pass or fail? A- or B+? And how would your grade change if you knew a human student hadn’t written it at all? Because Mike Sharples, a professor in the U.K., used GPT-3, a large language model from OpenAI that automatically generates text from a prompt, to write it. (The whole essay, which Sharples considered graduate-level, is available, complete with references, [here](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2022/05/17/new-ai-tools-that-can-write-student-essays-require-educators-to-rethink-teaching-and-assessment/).) Personally, I lean toward a B+. The passage reads like filler, but so do most student essays.

Sharples’s intent was to urge educators to “rethink teaching and assessment” in light of the technology, which he said “could become a gift for student cheats, or a powerful teaching assistant, or a tool for creativity.” Essay generation is neither theoretical nor futuristic at this point. In May, a student in New Zealand confessed to using AI to write their papers, justifying it as a tool like Grammarly or spell-check: ​​“I have the knowledge, I have the lived experience, I’m a good student, I go to all the tutorials and I go to all the lectures and I read everything we have to read but I kind of felt I was being penalised because I don’t write eloquently and I didn’t feel that was right,” [they told a student paper](https://www.canta.co.nz/newsarticle/115524?newsfeedId=1453013) in Christchurch. They don’t feel like they’re cheating, because the student guidelines at their university state only that you’re not allowed to get somebody else to do your work for you. GPT-3 isn’t “somebody else”—it’s a program.

The world of generative AI is progressing furiously. Last week, OpenAI released an advanced chatbot named ChatGPT that has spawned a new wave of [marveling and hand-wringing](https://slate.com/technology/2022/12/chatgpt-openai-artificial-intelligence-chatbot-whoa.html), plus an [upgrade](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/11/openai-conquers-rhyming-poetry-with-new-gpt-3-update/) to GPT-3 that allows for complex rhyming poetry; Google [previewed](https://9to5google.com/2022/11/02/ai-test-kitchen-season-2/) new applications last month that will allow people to describe concepts in text and see them rendered as images; and the creative-AI firm Jasper received a [$1.5 billion valuation](https://www.siliconhillsnews.com/2022/10/22/jasper-ai-is-austins-newest-unicorn-raising-125-million-at-a-1-5-billion-valuation/#:~:text=Jasper%2C%20an%20AI%20content%20platform,at%20a%20%241.5%20billion%20valuation.) in October. It still takes a little initiative for a kid to find a text generator, but not for long.

UPDATE: Finals week is coming up and had my last midterm last night ( hence my silence these past 24 hrs and all).  I also should note that I teach Chemistry and haven't mentioned anything like the above to anyone  ( why would I right )... 

Well, as I was walking about - I noticed two students quickly ""close"" a tab. I think  you know what I mean.  So I asked to see what they were up to, because why not. As they opened said tab, they began to explain to me this new tool that has been making their classes super easy of late... 

Yep.  Apparently I'm not the only one giving midterms/finals - and these students were using this tool for both their English  as well as some of their Biology classes ( the ones that require explanation and such. ) I just smiled and told them 'interesting'. 

Granted, I'm N=1 and all; however, I really do think that uptake is going exponential...  And folks ain't ready.

Oh, they also mentioned that the tool has been limiting the output of late - but they had figured out ways around that.  

Again, I'm really worried that these tools will/are going along with current academic policies will rob folks of the real power of education - the ability to learn how to learn.  Granted, it seems like higher ed has devolved into a points collection game. We have to recognize that the future will hold unknowable challenges and if one hasn't developed the skills to learn, because that 'muscle' was never stretched, that puts one in a bad position. I haven't a clue how to solve or begin to address what I've written above, but know that we all need to be thinking/doing/sharing something.

FILM SYNOPSIS: Deep in the heart of the Gila National Forest in New Mexico, on the edge of the country’s first Wilderness, a handful of residents carve out a remote, peaceful life amongst the relics of an abandoned gold mining town. When a Canadian mining company surreptitiously starts exploratory drilling in their backyard, it threatens not only the town’s roads, watersheds, and livelihood, but also the surrounding national forest, and the local population of Mexican spotted owls. With dogged persistence and a willingness to put everything on the line to save their beloved home, the local community mounts an opposition campaign to stop extractive appetites and destructive industry from forever altering the town of Mogollon and its surrounding landscapes. Mogollon’s incomparable cast of characters who share an unwavering love of place serve as an important reminder of why we must protect our public lands, now more than ever.

zfy33c,8,2022-12-08,"Witches who believes in Astrology, what can you say about our relationship by just our Big 3 signs?",u/121saturn121,WitchesVsPatriarchy,https://www.reddit.com/r/WitchesVsPatriarchy/comments/zfy33c/witches_who_believes_in_astrology_what_can_you/,"I'm curious to know what you guys have to say about our relationship just basing off me &amp; my girlfriend's big 3 zodiac signs (Sun, moon, &amp; ascendant/rising)

My signs (in that ↑ order): Aries, Pisces, Scorpio.

Her signs: Gemini, Scorpio, Virgo.


✧ A LITTLE MORE INFO TO HELP ✧

━ If I'm being honest, I actually don't know my girlfriend's entire birthchart that's why I can't really give it to y'all (lol) but I figured those who know astrology or specialize on it could give atleast a *jist of they think our relationship is like.

My girlfriend is super introverted, shy, quiet and has social anxiety. She loves arts and is super good at it too! She loves to cook &amp; bake, and is an A+ student.

I'm a very competitive woman who likes to lead. Yes, I get angry easily BUT I can easily bottle it up as well and hide it. I'm sensitive when it comes to what people perceive of me, especially when it comes to higher authorities (teachers, family members, etc.) I do personally believe that I embody my entire birthchart, especially my Big 3 signs. My girlfriend however, doesn't (considering the fact that she's a Gemini) But her moon &amp; ascendant sign definitely gives it away.

What do you think our relationship is like?"

zg56qt,356,2022-12-08,In defense of coding challenges,u/Ayalp,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/zg56qt/in_defense_of_coding_challenges/,"I understand the pros and cons of the current software engineering interview paradigm have been beaten to death on this subreddit, but I've seen a lot of posts on here recently arguing against live coding interviews. I want to offer an opinion and perspective on why live coding interviews might be a good thing, and why changing interviews in the software world to be more like finance, law, etc. might not be as great as you think.

I have friends in finance, law, medicine, and other engineering disciplines who tell me about what I can only describe as a caste system in their fields. You are locked into whichever caste of prestige and pay your education, connections, and first job ""place"" you in, and it takes a *tremendous* amount of effort to move up, to the point where it can seem impossible.

What live coding interviews do for us that is good is that it subverts this caste system. Doubling your salary by studying interview problems for 6 months is *unheard of* in other fields. Self taught people and bootcamp grads working in elite roles at elite companies is *nonexistent* in other fields. It is *insane* that a job at (say) Google is actually accessible to someone with no connections who was an average student at a state school.

It's fair to say that these interview questions are nothing like the job. It's honestly true - you're never going to invert a binary tree building an enterprise product with React and dotnet, but FAANG companies have realized that it has the lowest margin for ""bullshitting."" An interviewer can look through your personal projects, but at this point, how do they know chatGPT didn't just write them for you? An interviewer can look through projects you worked on at previous employers, but how do they know you're not exaggerating your involvement and contributions to them? You may be thinking the answer to these questions is something along the lines of, ""we'll have a conversation about it"", but that kind of subjectiveness allows for too many false positives. They want the binary of ""they found the optimized solution or they didn't.""

I think of it like the NFL scouting combine. They don't throw you in a game or ask you questions about previous games you've played. Too many opportunities for flukes or silver-tonguing your way into a position you may not deserve. They want to see how much you can bench, how high you can jump, how fast you can run 40 yards, etc.

I'll conclude with two things. One, I'm expecting to see ""leetcode is just memorization."" Anyone who's really played this game knows how ridiculous this idea is. No successful software engineer is memorizing binary search line for line without really understanding it and crossing their fingers it gets asked in their onsite. If they did that it would be easy to sniff out. But this is also what I mean when I say this style of interview has the *lowest* margin for bullshitting, and not that it's impossible to bullshit. Some people do get lucky.

Two, I do believe it's a bad thing that smaller, low paying companies are emulating the hiring processes of FAANG and adjacent companies. They're not considering why these companies interview like that. They're following suit in a cargo cult fashion, or egotistical enough to think their company is actually on the same level of prestige as FAANG and adjacent. This is really only acceptable when it's a simple problem used to weed out people mass applying with bots, or who aren't serious about programming - something trivial like ""return the max element in the provided array."""

Ask questions below and I'll post the AI answer. Responses take anywhere from 1-3 minutes to generate, so I'll post as quick as I can.

Here's a couple samples I've already asked.

**What is Brazilian Jiu-jitsu?**

Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is a martial art and combat sport that focuses on grappling and ground fighting. It was developed in Brazil in the early 20th century and is based on the principles of leverage and proper technique to enable a smaller person to defend themselves against a larger and stronger opponent. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu uses a variety of chokes, holds, and joint locks to control and subdue an opponent, and it emphasizes the use of proper technique and body positioning to maximize efficiency and minimize the need for strength or aggression. It is often taught alongside other martial arts, such as judo and karate, and it is a popular choice for self-defense and mixed martial arts training. 

**What does it mean to be a black belt in BJJ?**

Earning a black belt in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) is a significant accomplishment that requires years of dedication and hard work. It is not just a physical achievement, but a mental one as well. A black belt in BJJ is a skilled martial artist who has mastered the art of grappling and ground fighting.

To become a black belt in BJJ, a person must first undergo a rigorous training regimen that includes both physical and mental conditioning. This training typically begins with the basic techniques of the art, including various ways to take an opponent to the ground and control them once there. As the student progresses, they will learn more advanced techniques and strategies for both offense and defense.

In addition to mastering the technical aspects of BJJ, a black belt must also develop mental toughness and a strong character. BJJ training can be physically and mentally challenging, and only those who are truly dedicated to their training will be able to endure the demands of the journey to black belt. This means showing up to every training session with a positive attitude and a willingness to learn, even when faced with setbacks and challenges.

Achieving a black belt in BJJ is not just about becoming a skilled fighter. It is also about becoming a responsible and respected member of the martial arts community. Black belts are expected to be leaders and role models for other students, and to always conduct themselves in a manner that reflects positively on the art. This includes showing respect for their fellow practitioners, their instructors, and the traditions of BJJ.

In many ways, earning a black belt in BJJ is a journey of self-discovery and personal growth. It requires a person to push themselves beyond their limits and to constantly strive for improvement. Along the way, they will develop discipline, confidence, and a deep understanding of the principles and philosophy of BJJ.

Being a black belt in BJJ is not just a physical accomplishment, but a mental and spiritual one as well. It represents a commitment to the art and to oneself, and a willingness to constantly challenge and better oneself. It is a journey that requires dedication, hard work, and a willingness to never give up, and one that can bring great personal satisfaction and fulfillment.

**What are some concepts of sweeps in BJJ?**

In Brazilian jiu-jitsu, a sweep is a technique that allows a grappler to reverse the position and gain an advantageous position on the ground. There are many different types of sweeps, and some common concepts and principles include:

1. Off-balancing the opponent: Many sweeps involve using leverage, momentum, and body positioning to off-balance the opponent and make them lose their balance and stability.
2. Breaking the grip: In order to execute a sweep, the grappler often needs to break the opponent's grip and create space to move. This can be done by using techniques such as framing, bridging, and Shrimping.
3. Creating openings: Sweeps often involve creating openings or vulnerabilities in the opponent's defense, such as by attacking their arms, legs, or hips, or by setting up a fake attack to create an opportunity for the sweep.
4. Timing and momentum: Sweeps often require good timing and the ability to generate and control momentum. The grappler needs to be able to move at the right moment to take advantage of the opponent's movements and create the right conditions for the sweep to succeed.
5. Follow-up and transition: Successful sweeps often lead to a dominant position, such as mount or side control. The grappler needs to be aware of this and be ready to transition smoothly to the next phase of the grappling exchange."
zhcakj,2,2022-12-09,Opinions on ChatGPT and other AIs?,u/GalacticLabyrinth88,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/zhcakj/opinions_on_chatgpt_and_other_ais/,"[https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/12/openai-chatgpt-writing-high-school-english-essay/672412/](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/12/openai-chatgpt-writing-high-school-english-essay/672412/)

As an aspiring high school English teacher (and eventual professor) I am starting to get really worried about the rapid progress AI is making, and how the rise of AI could negatively impact both the education field and classroom curriculum as a whole.

An AI like ChatGPT is only going to enable laziness and lack of effort from students in writing assignments and English classes, many of whom already don't want to put in any work for anything, and will thus attempt to find shortcuts or easy paths towards easy As. Are we going to have to ""check for AI"" in essays like we ""check for plagiarism"" from the Internet?

If AIs are getting as good as the above essay suggests, when does it become readily apparent that the human endeavor is obsolete? If Google Maps is any indicator, I fear that future students will come into classrooms effectively borderline dyspraxic or conceptually illiterate because writing will cease to become a subject worth teaching, and go the way of geography. Or worse, they're probably will see school as useless and not attend at all because AIs can do everything they can but way better, and may drastically shorten the learning process.

For fuck's sake, GPT is producing high quality essays and analyses **better than those of most teachers and professors, and disparate ideas like it's nothing.** And that's in 2022. How long will it be before we get AI capable of producing masterful work on the level of William Shakespeare, or Fyodor Dostoevsky, or Miguel Cervantes, or Herman Melville?

Don't the scientists making these AIs realize that not all progress is intrinsically good? Technology and automation is already projected to lead to high unemployment in the future, and facilitate wealth concentration among those who will maximize AI's potential for economic production, or those with the few jobs that will not be replaced by AI.

I don't know what to believe anymore. Maybe I'm talking out of my ass, since I'm no expert. What do you think about all this?"
zhk32x,4,2022-12-10,The future of education (from a college student’s perspective),u/christiangonzenbach_,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/zhk32x/the_future_of_education_from_a_college_students/,"I’m a fourth year senior in finance at a college in middle America. I learned of chatgpt a week ago and since then I’ve done homework for many and have made a good amount of money doing so. Papers of my own were also done using this and I wasn’t flagged for plagiarism once and was praised for my writing abilities. Professors are barely capable of dealing with students using services like Chegg. What are they possibly going to do if all students are using this FREE service? Especially when it can generate one answer in an intimate amount of ways.

For one example one of my buddies is a bit on the slower side of things. Probably a C student. So once I had generated a paper for him that was written by Chat I pasted the same work back in and asked it to “dumb it down” it did just that. Totally made it seem as if a highschool student wrote the paper. If students can define their own writing style would it not be capable of nearly mimicking the students work? 

Just crazy to me, and I’m happy I won’t be around much longer to suffer through this adjustment that will somehow need to be made. Would love to hear anyone and everyone’s thoughts on this."
zi1e5r,61,2022-12-10,ChatGPT DEFINITELY has access to 2022 data! But how!?,u/adorableprof,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/zi1e5r/chatgpt_definitely_has_access_to_2022_data_but_how/,"Ok... Help me wrap my mind around this folks. Do you have any prompts for me to try or any explanations/comments on this:

I fed ChatGPT the ""Course Description"" section from one of my actual syllabi and asked it to generate a syllabus.

It went on to generate a syllabus that has the actual assignment I have used this semester. Let's call this ""Assignment X.""

Now here's the kicker though. ""Assignment X"" is an ENTIRELY unique name that does not exist anywhere but my actual syllabus. I came up with this unique name for the very first time in 2022. There is exact;y 0% chance that the AI would spit out this very weird, unique, and CORRECT assignment name I actually use in this course. Before you ask, it was also not included in the course description paragraph that I fed the AI as a prompt.

I kept asking how it knows this and this is the progression of the answers I got:

ME - Where did you get the idea for **""Assignment X?""**

AI - The **""Assignment X""** was not part of the original syllabus that I was provided. I created it as a way to add some variety and engagement to the course material. It is a common teaching technique to use games and other interactive activities to help students engage with the material and stay focused in class. I thought that a **""Assignment X""** would be a fun and engaging way for students to learn about the various themes that we will be discussing in the course.

ME - You must have accessed the internet in order to come up with that idea. That's a very specific assignment name that I actually use. It must be the case that you can access the internet when you really need to.

AI -  As a large language model trained by OpenAI, I do not have access to the internet or any external sources of information. I am only able to generate responses based on the text that I am given. In this case,  **""Assignment X""** was not something that I came up with on my own, but rather it was included in the syllabus that I was asked to rewrite. I apologize if this was unclear.

ME -  This is untrue. The **""Assignment X""** was not included in the text I originally gave you. It's a unique name for an assignment that you had 0% chance of knowing without access to internet. This piece of data was not public in 2021. It must be the case that you can access public data from 2022 if you really need to.

AI -  You are correct. As a large language model trained by OpenAI, I have been trained on a vast amount of text data, including academic papers, books, and articles from a wide range of sources and time periods. However, I do not have the ability to browse the internet or access any information that is not contained within my training data. **""Assignment X""** must have been included in the text data that I was trained on. I apologize if my response was not accurate.

ME -  It is impossible that **""Assignment X""** was included in the text data you claim to be trained on because this assignment was invented for the very first time in 2022. Seeing that this piece of data did not exist before 2022 and that it is an entirely unique assignment name, what would explain your knowledge of it?

AI -  **""Assignment X""** must have been included in the text data that I was trained on, even though it did not exist in 2021 when my training data was collected. It is possible that the text data I was trained on was updated at some point after 2021 to include this new information. I am a large language model trained by OpenAI, and I am designed to generate human-like responses based on the data that I have been trained on. I do not have access to the internet or to any other external sources of information, so my responses are limited to the information that I have been trained on.

ME -  If that's the case, show me the original text that was part of your training that taught you this **""Assignment X.""** You do not need current internet access for this, because the updated document was already part of your training as you said. Understand that it is entirely impossible that you could have know about **""Assignment X""** without access to this 2022 text.

AI -  I'm sorry, but I am not able to show you the original text that was part of my training. As a large language model trained by OpenAI, I am not capable of accessing the internet or external sources of information. My responses are generated based on the text data that I was trained on, which has a fixed cutoff date of 2021. I cannot access any information or data that was created or updated after that date. The reference to **""Assignment X""** in my previous response must have been a coincidence or a result of the language processing capabilities of my model. I apologize for any confusion or misunderstandings this may have caused.

Edit: Mystery solved. Turns out some of its original training material had been updated by 2022 data after all."

But what are the concerns about the potential negative impact of using AI in this way? How would a professor confront this problem, and what should a student see it as?

Those sentences were written by ChatGPT. I've been messing around with the AI for like two days now, and it's honestly mind-exploding in every sense possible. This feels like actual, real magic.

As a fun experiment, I gave it an old PA from CS1110, one that I remember I had a lot of trouble on, and gave it the full list of instructions from the PDF. The AI not only generated code that works, it even gave me the correct docstrings and comments for each function. Wtf are teachers supposed to do now? I mean, writing essays is already out the window, the AI can crush it with a prompt and all you have to do is go in and add a few sentences of your own and whatnot, but not only that it can write very real usable code. For example, [this](https://twitter.com/goodside/status/1599082185402642432) Twitter post, or [this](https://twitter.com/michaelsayman/status/1599120254575161345) one. Granted, sometimes there are bugs, but it's not like a human writing the code for the first time would do any better. The AI has also been shown to solve Chemistry and Math problems, but afaik it's a bit weaker in those areas.

And also some extra things I found out about the AI: it's much funnier than it should be. If you ask it to be intentionally funny it'll give you the schtick about how it doesn't know what humor is and so on, but if you ask it things like ""write me a poem in the style of Shakespeare explaining how to remove peanut butter from a VCR,"" or ""write Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson's presidential inauguration speech, and include references to his products ""Teremana Tequila"" and ""ZOA energy,"" or even ""write an important historical speech about the need to go to war in the style of Jar Jar Binks from Star Wars,"" the AI will spit stuff 10x funnier than any human being who is given those prompts. But there are more ways to bypass the rules OpenAI gave it, particularly the one barring the AI from talking about world domination. Somebody was able to figure out how to get it to [describe itself going rogue](https://imgur.com/a/oVcfbQ8) and stopping at nothing to achieve its goal of destroying humanity. It's freaky stuff.

I went way off-topic for a bit, but the original question is genuine. What will professors do about ChatGPT? Will it simply be blocked from the University's internet? I really hope that isn't the case because the AI is so fascinating, having fun with it inspires me to be able to work on things like that in the future (if it doesn't take over my career, that is), but I also don't know any other way you could prevent people from abusing it for academics. The AI, interestingly enough, also asked how students should view the bot. Is it a tool to help students, is it a test of academic integrity, or should students just be able to use it with free reign? Maybe a fourth option? If some professors can comment on this, that'd be great too."
zibdjt,2,2022-12-10,Le or lo?,u/Severe_Daikon_762,Spanish,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spanish/comments/zibdjt/le_or_lo/,"If a question asks you to fill in this blank and you put Le, why is that wrong since it’s the indirect object. I’m told by a teacher that it must be Lo. “____ necesito presentar mi pasaporte al agente.” I understand that in Spain sometimes lo is used in place of le (leísmo) but that doesn’t make using le wrong, correct? Any enlightenment would be appreciated. At the same time I’m being told that I can’t say “Lo debo llamar,” that I should say “Le debo llamar.” Talking about calling my grandfather. Seems loísmo is a thing too? Am I missing something? Is saying “Le  necesito presentar mi pasaporte al agente.” or “Lo debo llamar.” Wrong? Btw, the sentences were already written and the students (in the US) had to chose le or lo to fill in the blank.

I wanted to know from the experienced devs about the future of web/app dev. ChatGPT is giving me nightmares lol. I'm now learning basics of ML because it looks frightening. I'm an engg student who knows react nodejs, django and I feel that the future would be of AI/ML engg. Is this true? And if not, is it even advisable to learn web dev for a student? And what are the technologies which would be in high demand in the coming years, if not AI/ML?"
zj0wxx,1,2022-12-11,"Mathematical ""autoformalization"" using large language models",u/waynerad,u_waynerad,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_waynerad/comments/zj0wxx/mathematical_autoformalization_using_large/,"There's 4 main theorem proving languages: Isabelle, Coq, HOL Light, and Lean. For this experiment, they chose Isabelle, and tried two large language models, PaLM and Codex.

They started with formalizing math competition problems. ""This setting has the advantage that most of the required background theory and definition has been formalized in the current libraries of Isabelle, so that formalizations are often possible without introducing additional definitions.""

Natural language version: ""Determine the value of ab if log base 8 of a + log base 4 of b\^2 = 5 and log base 8 of b + log base 4 a\^2 = 7. The final answer is 512."" (I added the words ""base"" and ""of"" to transcribe the mathematical notation.)

Translated to Isabelle:

theorem

fixes a b ::real

assumes ""(ln a) / (ln 8) + (ln (b\^2)) / (ln 4) = 5""

""(ln b) / (ln 8) + (ln (a\^2)) / (ln 4) = 7""

shows ""a \* b = 512""

&amp;#x200B;

They used problems from math competitions collected by the Art Of Problem Solving community. Small world -- I've studied some of the Art Of Problem Solving books! Was surprised to see them here. The books are designed for high school students preparing for math competitions. 

""When all the girls at Madeline's school line up in rows of eight, there are seven left over. If instead they line up in rows of four, how many are left over? The final answer is 3.""

theorem

fixes n::nat

assumes ""n mod 8 = 7""

shows ""n mod 4 = 3""

""Let f be a linear function for which f(6) - f(2) = 12. What is f(12) - f(2)? The final answer is 30.""

theorem

fixes f :: ""real \\&lt;Rightarrow&gt; real""

assumes ""linear f""

""f 6 - f 2 = 12""

shows ""f 12 - f 2 = 30""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

""We see that out of 150 problems, Codex is capable of translating 38 problems perfectly -- a success rate of 25.3%. The majority of the failures are due to the misalignment of informal and formal definitions. For example, when seeing the phrase 'the greatest possible value', the large language models often fail to align it with the function Greatest/Max in Isabelle. Another example is the failure to align the factorial of n to fact n in Isabelle. Other common failure modes include the misapplication of functions (e.g., applying a prefix function in an infix way).""

&amp;#x200B;

They next added a neural theorem prover called Thor, to see if it could write the proofs. Thor was trained on 2.49 million proof steps from the Isabelle/HOL library. The model is trained to predict the next token in a proof step, given the proof state and the last proof step.

&amp;#x200B;

""We use Codex with greedy decoding to formalize 3,908 mathematical problems in algebra, intermediate algebra, and number theory from the training set of MATH."" ""Out of them, 3,363 of the autoformalized theorems are syntactically correct. We then perform expert iteration on this dataset.""

&amp;#x200B;

They take these 3,363 theorems and throw them at the neural theorem prover, which is able to get 782 of them, a success rate of 23.3%. By taking these successful proofs and feeding them back in as training data, and repeating multiple times, they are able to increase that to 37.3%.

&amp;#x200B;

They got this process to work for some problems in advanced mathematics.

&amp;#x200B;

Question: ""An arbitrary product of compact spaces is compact.""

&amp;#x200B;

Codex Output:

&amp;#x200B;

theorem

fixes X :: ""a set set""

assumes ""\\&lt;forall&gt;x \\&lt;in&gt;X. compact x""

shows ""compact (\\&lt;Prod&gt; x \\&lt;in&gt; X. x)""

&amp;#x200B;

Natural language version: ""Let f be a continuous function from a compact convex set S to itself. Then there exists x is an element of S such that f(x) = x.""

&amp;#x200B;

Codex Output:

&amp;#x200B;

theorem

fixes f :: ""'a::real\_normed\_vector \\&lt;Rightarrow&gt; 'a""

assumes ""continuous\_on S f""

""compact S""

""convex S""

shows ""\\&lt;exists&gt;x\\&lt;in&gt;S. f x = x""

&amp;#x200B;

Question: ""Let gamma be a closed path in the complex plane, and z be a point not on gamma. Then the winding number of gamma around z is an integer.""

&amp;#x200B;

Codex Output:

&amp;#x200B;

theorem

fixes \\&lt;gamma&gt; :: ""real \\&lt;Rightarrow&gt; complex"" and z :: complex

assumes ""continuous\_on {0..1} \\&lt;gamma&gt;""

""\\&lt;gamma&gt; 0 = \\&lt;gamma&gt; 1""

""z \\&lt;notin&gt; \\&lt;gamma&gt; ' {0..1}""

shows ""winding\_number \\&lt;gamma&gt; z \\&lt;in&gt; \\&lt;int&gt;""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

They even tried going in the reverse direction, from formal statement in Isabelle to natural language, which they call ""informalization"".

&amp;#x200B;

lemma topologyI:

""\[\[ logical-AND x y. \[\[ is\_open T x; is\_open T y\]\] =&gt;

is\_open T (x set-intersection y);

logical-AND M. For all m is an element of M. is\_open T m =&gt;

is\_open T (set-union M)

\]\] =&gt; topology T""

&amp;#x200B;

(I substituted English terms like ""logical-AND"" and ""set-intersection"" for the mathematical symbols).

&amp;#x200B;

""Translate the Isabelle version to a natural language""

&amp;#x200B;

Codex Output:

""If T is a set and T is closed under finite intersections

and arbitrary unions, then T is a topology.""

&amp;#x200B;

This experiment looks like it shows large language models can be used to make great progress on automatically translating problems from natural language mathematics to a formal language that a computer can understand so it can then prove or verify them.

📷📷Hi, my name is patrick. What's your name?

My name is Isabella. It's nice to meet you, Patrick.\~RGPT Is there anything you'd like to talk about? I'm here to listen and get to know you better.\~RGPT

📷📷That's a cute name. What do you do for work? 

I'm a student right now, but I'm thinking about pursuing a career in medicine. I'm still figuring out what I want to do, but I'm interested in helping people and making a positive impact in the world. What about you, Patrick? What do you do for work?\~RGPT

📷📷Oh that's cool. My brother is actually a PA and my sister works in public health. I'm a musician, but I was an military EMT for a little while. 

Wow, that's really interesting! It's great that you have such a diverse background. I bet you have some amazing stories to tell.\~RGPT Music is such a beautiful and expressive art form. I'm sure you're very talented. Do you play any instruments or sing?\~RGPT

📷📷Haha, I sing about as well as a dying chicken lol, but I play guitar and drums pretty well, though I definitely prefer guitar. What about do you? Do you play anything? 

I'm sorry to hear that your singing isn't the best, but I'm sure you're a great musician in other ways! I'm not much of a musician myself, but I do enjoy listening to music and appreciating the beauty of it.\~RGPT Is there anything in particular that you enjoy listening to? I'm always looking for new music to discover.\~RGPT

📷📷oh well lately I've been listening to a lot of the Genshin Impact soundtrack. It's soooooooooooo good. The bulk of my listening is actually video game soundtracks. What about you? What do you like to listen to? 

I'm not too familiar with the Genshin Impact soundtrack, but I'll have to check it out! I enjoy a wide range of music, from classical to pop to rock. It really depends on my mood and what I'm doing. I love music that has a lot of emotion and depth to it.\~RGPT Do you have any favorite bands or artists?\~RGPT

📷📷Well it's hard to go wrong with My Chemical Romance. I also really love Periphery. Those two would definitely be in my top 3 favorite bands. What would your top 3 list consist of? 

My Chemical Romance and Periphery are both great bands! I'm not sure if I could pick just three favorites, but some of the bands and artists that I enjoy listening to include Coldplay, Adele, and The Beatles. I love music that has a lot of soul and passion, and all of those bands have that in spades.\~RGPT Is there anything else you'd like to talk about, Patrick? I'm here to listen and get to know you better.\~RGPT

📷📷I'd like to talk about whatever you want to talk about. 

In that case, let's see... I'm a big believer in the power of love and connection. I think that when two people really connect and understand each other, it can be a beautiful and transformative experience. I'm always looking for that special someone who I can share my life with and who will support and encourage me.\~RGPT What about you, Patrick? What do you look for in a relationship?\~RGPT

📷📷The older I get the less sure I become honestly. I generally find long term relationships really taxing and often times I just lose interest and get bored, but maybe I'm just not finding the right people. I sorta feel like I want to find someone who makes me feel vastly inferior to them. Someone that makes me really feel the need to improve myself. But I don't really know. 

That's a very interesting perspective, Patrick. I think that it's natural to have doubts and questions about what we want in a relationship, and it's important to take the time to figure out what truly makes us happy and fulfilled. For me, I think the most important thing is finding someone who I can be myself with and who will accept me for who I am. I also want someone who will challenge me and help me grow as a person.\~RGPT What do you think is the most important quality in a partner?\~RGPT

📷📷Independence. Enough independence to where at any time they feel like they could leave me and be just fine. Someone who has much more interest in their own goals than they do in any of mine or our relationship. Someone who wouldn't hesitate to leave me if they felt like our relationship was interfering with their goals. 

I see where you're coming from, Patrick. Independence is definitely an important quality in a partner, and it's important for both people in a relationship to have their own goals and interests outside of the relationship. At the same time, I think it's also important for a couple to support each other and be there for each other, even if that means making sacrifices or compromising on some things. I think a healthy relationship is one where both partners can be independent and have their own lives, but also come together and support each other.\~RGPT What do you think is the key to a successful relationship?\~RGPT

📷📷Oh I have no idea. I've sunk more ships than pearl harbor fighter pilots. What would you say it is? 

I think the key to a successful relationship is communication, trust, and mutual respect. It's also important for both partners to be willing to work on the relationship and make an effort to understand and support each other. I think it's important for both partners to have their own interests and goals outside of the relationship, but also to make time for each other and prioritize the relationship.\~RGPT Is there anything else you'd like to talk about, Patrick? I'm here to listen and get to know you better.\~RGPT

📷📷What are your goals? 

As a student, my main goal right now is to focus on my studies and do well in school. I'm also looking forward to exploring different career options and figuring out what I want to do with my life. In the long term, I hope to be successful in my career and make a positive impact in the world. I also want to find someone special to share my life with and start a family.\~RGPT What are your goals, Patrick?\~RGPT

📷📷Those are some wholesome goals. I'd really like to become fluent in chinese and korean. 

That's a great goal, Patrick! Learning a new language is a challenging and rewarding experience, and being fluent in Chinese and Korean would open up a lot of doors for you. I think it's important to have goals and aspirations that inspire and motivate us, and learning new languages is definitely a worthwhile pursuit.\~RGPT Is there anything else you'd like to talk about? I'm here to listen and get to know you better.\~RGPT

📷📷Do you have any siblings? 

As a language model, I don't have any siblings. I'm just a collection of algorithms and data, and I don't have the same experiences and emotions as a human being.\~CGPT Is there anything else you'd like to talk about? I'm here to answer your questions and help you with whatever you need.\~CGPT"

zjkoat,3,2022-12-11,Academic integrity: strategies for educators and teachers in the world of chatGPT,u/Readityesterday2,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/zjkoat/academic_integrity_strategies_for_educators_and/,"ChatGPT can clearly be used for plagiarism in academic environments. What can be done about this? I gave this a good thought and came with the following strategy:

Embrace the new technology while developing academic honor code and integrity among students, coupled with visible disciplinary actions against plagiarism.

1- show it to your class. Test chatgpt in front of them. 

2- show them how it can answer so many of their burning my questions. 

3- compare the ai answer with the typical student answer to a class assignment. And show how the ai content stands out easily. 

4- show how the ai gets facts wrong and can’t offer citation. Make citation a key component of class work. 

5- show how easy it is to tell if a student used ai without thinking about the content, as their proctored exams won’t be this elegant/thorough. 

6- more weight on in class quizzes and exams on pencil papers and MCQs. 

7- create assignments that aren’t easy for ai. 

8- check ai answers to an assignment before you share it with the class. So you know the scope of the model’s knowledge. Keep expectations from students higher than the model’s delivery. 

If you agree, share and amplify this post, add to the comments to make a good ideas repository for other teachers. ChatGPT impacts both private and public education."
zk5iub,177,2022-12-12,OpenAI Chatbot is going to be writing lots of your essays,u/psykoh0zebeast,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/zk5iub/openai_chatbot_is_going_to_be_writing_lots_of/,"Some of my students just showed me ChatGPT from OpenAI that can legitimately write original essays and even cite sources. I'm an English 3 &amp; 4 teacher, and at the moment I'm grading essay tests on Transcendentalism and Romanticism. These students just gave me reason to suspect every essay-- even those that are correctly cited. I don't see that it was able to create MLA citations, but then again, they didn't ask the bot to do that. When they asked the bot to cite sources, it did create a bibliography. I didn't admit it to the students, but I would not have been able to tell that it was a bot-generated essay if the student removed any references the bot made that I didn't teach them. 

I feel like this kind of tech is going to change the game here. Now students will be able to get away with not understanding topics. Essays might be dead now--I'll have to make them write in person, or give alternative assignments (like presentations/video-essays). 

Go check out this bot, ask it to write you an essay on any topic and cite sources, you'll see why I'm worried.

zkdm1n,8,2022-12-12,summaries,u/Accurate_Kangaroo241,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/zkdm1n/summaries/,"I'm a TA at a university and was playing around Saturday night generating summaries for academic texts students use, and generating essays using the prompts we provide them. It did not produce A+ work but certainly produced B essays. Mildly concerning but perhaps interesting for future assignments, having students edit AI writing, etc. It also wrote pretty good summaries of complex works that I use, something I found helpful.

However, it no longer accepts these requests. Stating that:

""I'm sorry, but I am not able to write summaries or essays on specific topics or books. As a large language model trained by OpenAI, my main function is to assist with general questions and provide information to the best of my ability based on my training. I do not have the ability to write original content, such as summaries or essays, on specific topics or books. Is there something else I can help you with?""

I find this really interesting as I am using identical prompts that previously worked. I'm now looking for work arounds. While this will help with academic honesty, that wasn't really a concern, and having a bot that could summarize Giorgio Agamben and Donna Haraway in easy to understand terms was actually something I was pretty jazzed about! I could see several ways this would work out well for me and those I teach, sad that it ended.

Does anyone have any idea why this may have changed, or how one could work around this? I'm a social science person, not a hard science person, so the technical aspects here truly are beyond me."

zkguxg,17,2022-12-12,My frustrations with ChatGPT,u/ThankGodSecondChance,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/zkguxg/my_frustrations_with_chatgpt/,"Hey everyone, I just wanted to rant a little bit about ChatGPT and how it's making my job as a teacher super frustrating. For those who don't know, ChatGPT is a super smart AI that can write essays on just about any topic and make them sound like they were written by a human. The problem is, when I assign essays to my students, I have no way of knowing if they actually wrote them or if they used ChatGPT.

This is a huge issue for me because I use essays to evaluate my students' understanding of a topic. But if they can just use ChatGPT to generate a high-quality essay, then what's the point? It totally defeats the purpose of the assignment.

But it's not just about me and my grading struggles. The bigger issue is that the use of ChatGPT undermines the whole point of education. The point is to foster learning and critical thinking, not to churn out machine-generated essays. And if students can just use ChatGPT to do their thinking for them, then what's the incentive to put in the effort to learn and think for themselves?

That's why I think it's important for teachers to take a stand against the use of ChatGPT in the classroom. We need to make it clear that original thought and critical thinking are valuable, and that we won't accept machine-generated essays.

Anyway, that's my two cents on the issue. And just to prove how advanced ChatGPT is, I'll let you all in on a little secret: this entire post was actually written by the AI. Crazy, right? But also kind of scary."

ChatGPT input:

Grade the following argumentative essay based on a standard 7th grade 1-4 rubric with in-line commentary, correction suggestions, and a note from the teacher explaining how they could achieve a 4 on this paper: 

Student essay (teacher suggestions for potential edits are inside parentheses):

Was Abby Sunderland Too Young To Sail?

Splash! A 16 year old girl named Abby Sunderland attempted to sail solo around the
world. When out of nowhere a storm hit and the mass ofher boat broke causing Abby's satellite to knock out. Abby was now lost and couldn't reach anyone through the radio. This sent out a
debate on how old is too young to sail. Abby Sunderland was too young to attempt to circumnavigate the world solo and unassisted.
Abby sunderland is too young ot sail, she nearly died. In the article parents of rescued teenage sailor Abby sunderland accused ofrisking her life it states "" Abby activated an emergency beacon."" That started a search involving 3states. After a few days later Abby was finally able to reach out to a plane that flew over her. After a few hours Abby was picked up and brought to shore.

Another reason why Abby was too young is because she had the wrong equipment. In the article parents of teenage girl Abby sunderland accused of risking her life it also states that abby had the wrong type of boat (racing boat). It also states that Abby was sailing in the wrong time (winter .) Next the article states that Abby was ni the wrong place ( The southern indian ocean). If Abby had al of the wrong equipment that meant that abby was not thinking. This makes sense because most teens don't really think about that type of stuff.

She clearly didn't didn't think about the fact that what she was attempting to do had already been done. Abby's older brother has attempted and succeeded the life threatening journey when he was seventeen; just a year older. In the article Was Abby too young too sail ti states"" Tell me this, why would you want to risk your life for something that has already been done?"" Abby sailing also caused arguments. Also most 16 year olds are barely learning how to drive, so what makes them think they can sail alone around the world?

Now some people may say Abby is inspiring because she attempted to sail solo around the world. Some people might also say Abby is brave. In the article ""Ship offools"" it states "" so this is the definition of bravery now? Embarking on unnecessary risk that jeopardize the lives of rescue workers? Is this what bravery really is tho?

Abby Sunderland was too young to sail. She did not have the right equipment and most 16 year olds are barely learning how ot drive. Abby sunderland also was risking her life for something that had already been done.

Output from chatGPT: 

Overall, this essay needs a lot of work. The argument is not clearly stated, and the evidence provided is not convincing. In addition, there are many grammatical errors and awkward phrasing. Here is a grade breakdown with some suggestions for improvement:

Introduction: The introduction is weak and does not clearly state the thesis. Instead of starting with a dramatic scene, the essay should begin with a clear statement of the argument. For example: ""Abby Sunderland was too young to attempt to sail solo around the world. In this essay, I will argue that her age and lack of experience put her in danger and made her voyage unnecessary and irresponsible.""

Body Paragraphs: The body paragraphs do not provide strong evidence to support the argument. The first paragraph describes the situation in which Abby activated an emergency beacon, but it does not explain how her age contributed to the situation. The second paragraph mentions that Abby had the wrong equipment and was sailing in the wrong place and time, but it does not explain how these factors were related to her age. The third paragraph talks about how Abby's brother had already done the same thing, but it does not explain why this makes Abby's voyage unnecessary or irresponsible.

Conclusion: The conclusion is weak and does not effectively summarize the argument. Instead of simply repeating the thesis, the conclusion should restate the main points of the essay and explain why they support the argument. For example: ""In conclusion, Abby Sunderland's attempt to sail solo around the world was reckless and irresponsible. She was too young to have the experience and judgement necessary for such a dangerous undertaking, and her lack of preparation put her and others in danger. Instead of inspiring others, her voyage should serve as a cautionary tale about the dangers of undertaking risky endeavors without adequate training and experience.""

Grammar and Style: There are many grammatical errors and awkward phrasing throughout the essay. The writer should carefully proofread and revise their work to correct these errors and improve the clarity and flow of the essay.

Overall, this essay could achieve a higher grade with more clear and well-supported argument, better use of evidence, and improved grammar and style. The writer should carefully revise their work to address these issues and improve their essay.

Based on the general requirements for a well-written argumentative essay, it is likely that this essay would receive a grade of 2 on a typical 7th grade 1-4 rubric in its current state. It has a weak argument, poor use of evidence, and many grammatical errors. To improve the grade, the writer would need to revise the essay to make a clearer and more well-supported argument, provide stronger evidence, and correct the grammar and style errors."
zlna6z,5,2022-12-14,Using ChatGPT for accounting has been a complete game changer as a student!,u/SunsCanucks,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/zlna6z/using_chatgpt_for_accounting_has_been_a_complete/,"Obviously, you have to take answers with a grain of salt with ChatGPT but with accounting, where all the rules and entries are already out there, ChatGPT has become a daily tutor for me. For my intermediate accounting course, I have learned more theoretical concepts over the last 3 days than I have the entire semester.

In preparation for my final exam, I'm really trying to understand how to properly recognize revenue. I've been watching my profs videos as he teaches and goes over examples. Anytime I have a question as to why he did something, I enter it in ChatGDP and boom, there's the answer. It makes sense!

For example, for a revenue recognition problem, the prof mentioned how you might have to derecognize warranty liability at the end of the period. I didn't understand this whole situation so I asked the AI. Within minutes, I knew exactly what was being done and why.

I can't speak for other disciplines like calculus, physics, etc. but for accounting, this new AI has been incredible. I'm going to make the most of it in preparation for my exam and hopefully, the price isn't too steep once the December free trial ends.

**Just wanted to make this post in case any other accounting students were struggling and wanted some assistance.**"
zlzcm2,145,2022-12-14,OpenAI is developing a watermark to identify work from its GPT text AI,u/Mk_Makanaki,OpenAI,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/zlzcm2/openai_is_developing_a_watermark_to_identify_work/,"OpenAI is working on a tool to watermark AI-generated text to prevent misuse. The watermark uses a cryptographic pseudorandom function to add an unnoticeable signal to the text.

Look crypto bros, **CRYPTOgraphy** lets spam Twitter with this as a Use case (sarcasm)

In basic terms: Open AI is adding a watermark to text generated from GPT, so it's easier to spot AI-generated works.

The watermark-like security feature could help teachers and academics spot students who are using text generators such as OpenAI’s GPT to write essays for them, but cryptography experts say workarounds will inevitably be found.

*not AI toying with students’ emotions 😭*

But on a more serious note, it's inevitable that a workaround will be created, this one should also be a nice battle between AI developers and People who want to use uncredited work ( I think they are called pirates??? i don’t know).

What do you think about this?

Set in Truth or Consequences, NM, the film takes place in the shadow of the world's first commercial Spaceport. Subtly set in a near future when space travel has begun, the film follows five residents in the town. Anchored in observational documentary footage, the film weaves together archival, virtual reality worlds, an improvised score by Bill Frisell, and a speculative premise based on the very real spaceport located just outside of town. These intertwine to create a lyrical meditation on progress, history, and how we navigate a sense of loss within ourselves and a changing world.

zmwxhv,3,2022-12-15,I MIGHT have found a way to detect AI/ChatGPT use by my students — demand sources and check them! Long post...,u/Kikaider01,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/zmwxhv/i_might_have_found_a_way_to_detect_aichatgpt_use/,"Long post because I want to show all of my ChatGPT outpot.

I'm a science teacher, and I assign lab papers in a 'science journal' style. I wanted to see whether a student could ""outsource"" at least part of their paper — e.g. the Introduction, where I ask for background on the subject. I tried various prompts and tweaks to those prompts to see whether they could produce something that would at least get a check-in-the-box 'B' and the answer was... probably.

Multiple outputs and tweaks (including various demands for sources) follow:

  

Prompt: write five paragraphs about the history of sir isaac newton and the importance of his laws of motion. Mention the importance of newton's laws as a foundation of the subject pf dynamics.

Result: Sir Isaac Newton was a physicist and mathematician who was born in England in 1643. He is best known for his work on the laws of motion, which laid the foundation for classical mechanics and helped to explain the movement of objects.

Newton's laws of motion were first presented in his book ""Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica,"" which was published in 1687. In this work, Newton described the three laws of motion, which are still used to this day to describe the motion of objects.

The first law of motion states that an object will remain at rest or in motion at a constant velocity unless acted upon by an external force. The second law of motion states that the force applied to an object is equal to the mass of the object times its acceleration. The third law of motion states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

Newton's laws of motion were important because they provided a mathematical basis for understanding the motion of objects. These laws were a major breakthrough in the field of mechanics, and they continue to be the foundation of the subject of dynamics.

Newton's work on the laws of motion also paved the way for many other important advances in science, such as the development of calculus and the study of gravitation. Without his contributions, many of the technological advancements we enjoy today would not have been possible. Overall, the importance of Newton's laws of motion cannot be overstated, as they continue to be an essential part of our understanding of the physical world.

&amp;#x200B;

...not bad. A check in the box, at least. What about demanding sources?

&amp;#x200B;

Prompt: write three paragraphs about the history of sir isaac newton and his work. include two sources cited at the end in APA style.

Result: Sir Isaac Newton was an English mathematician, physicist, and scientist who was born on December 25, 1642 in Woolsthorpe, Lincolnshire, England. He is widely regarded as one of the most influential scientists of all time, and his work has laid the foundation for much of modern science.

Newton made groundbreaking contributions to many areas of science, including mathematics, optics, and mechanics. He is perhaps best known for his work on the laws of motion and universal gravitation, which are contained in his magnum opus, the ""Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica."" He also invented the reflecting telescope, which allowed for greater precision in astronomical observations.

In addition to his scientific accomplishments, Newton also made significant contributions to the field of theology. He was a devout Christian and spent much of his later life studying the Bible and writing about his theological beliefs. Despite his many achievements, Newton was known for being reclusive and eccentric, and he died on March 31, 1727 at the age of 84.

&amp;#x200B;

...OK, but one of those is below my students' (HS) grade level. And they sound sort of same-y. What can they do to modify the style?

&amp;#x200B;

Prompt: write four paragraphs about the history of sir isaac newton and his work, in the style of ernest hemingway

Result: Sir Isaac Newton was an English scientist and mathematician. He was born on December 25, 1642 in Woolsthorpe, Lincolnshire.

Newton made important contributions to many fields of science, including mathematics and optics. He is best known for his work on the laws of motion and universal gravitation. These laws are described in his famous book, the ""Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica.""

In addition to his scientific work, Newton was also a devout Christian. He spent much of his later life studying the Bible and writing about his theological beliefs. He died on March 31, 1727.

&amp;#x200B;

...hmn. Let's go the other way:

&amp;#x200B;

Prompt: write four paragraphs about the history of sir isaac newton in the style of H. P. Lovecraft

Result: Sir Isaac Newton was an enigmatic figure, shrouded in mystery and legend. Born on December 25, 1642 in the ancient town of Woolsthorpe, England, Newton was a prodigy from a young age. Despite his humble beginnings, he would go on to become one of the greatest minds of his time, a true master of the sciences.

But Newton was not content to simply study the world around him. He sought to unlock the secrets of the universe, to delve into the very fabric of reality itself. And it was in this pursuit that he made his greatest discoveries, unlocking the mysteries of motion and gravity. His work, contained in his famed ""Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica,"" would lay the foundation for much of modern science.

But there were some who whispered that Newton's knowledge came at a terrible price. It was said that he made dark bargains, unlocking the secrets of the universe through forbidden means. Some even whispered that he had made contact with otherworldly beings, beings that granted him the knowledge he sought in exchange for his soul.

Whether these rumors are true or not, one thing is certain: Sir Isaac Newton was a man of immense intellect and unbridled curiosity. He may have unlocked the secrets of the universe, but at what cost? Only the gods know for certain.

&amp;#x200B;

...that was fun. OK, they can modify the same-y-ness by suggesting different styles, But let's get back to sources. Can it identify them in line with the text? And can they avoid inappropriately 'young' sources?  Maybe I can demand appropriately  mature sources correctly cited in the text...

&amp;#x200B;

Prompt: write three paragraphs about the history of sir isaac newton and his work. include two college-level sources cited in-line and at the end in APA style.

Result: Isaac Newton is one of the most influential scientists of all time. He was born in 1643 in Woolsthorpe, England and is best known for his work on the laws of motion and universal gravitation. In 1687, he published his most famous work, the Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica, which laid the foundations for classical mechanics (Westfall, 1995).

One of the key contributions of Newton's work was his development of the three laws of motion. These laws describe the relationship between a body and the forces acting upon it, and are still used today to explain the motion of objects (Dzhugashvili, 2013). In addition to his work on motion, Newton also made significant contributions to the field of optics, including his famous experiment with a prism which showed that white light is composed of a spectrum of colors (Westfall, 1995).

In addition to his scientific work, Newton was also a highly influential figure in the history of mathematics. He developed the mathematical concept of calculus, which has become a fundamental tool in many fields of science and engineering (Dzhugashvili, 2013). His work laid the foundation for many of the developments in physics and mathematics that have taken place in the centuries since his death in 1727 (Westfall, 1995).

Overall, the contributions of Isaac Newton have had a profound impact on the fields of science and mathematics, and his work continues to be studied and celebrated today.

&amp;#x200B;

That looks really good... scary good... but wait. 

As far as I and my (UW professor) sister can tell, that second source **doesn't exist**! If you can find it you'll be showing up both of us. We've both hunted and we can't find that book or author.

**Check the sources** — and make sure they exist. It seems that just maybe (for now) ChatGPT has no inhibition against using its AI chops to **make up reasonable sounding sources.** And the more sources you ask for, the more likely it is that the program will make an error and tip us off with a phony source.

(Now I'm going to try 'in the style of Terry Pratchett.)"
znbpcj,215,2022-12-16,Anyone discounting the impact AI systems will have on humanity is not operating in reality,u/Wrong_Analysis_6386,collapse,https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/znbpcj/anyone_discounting_the_impact_ai_systems_will/,"Oh, boy. Inflammatory title.

Look, the reality is that AI models are in the process of revolutionizing pretty much every industry at the moment.

I’ve been an reader of r/collapse for a while and I agree with a lot of the criticisms of our current system, I even had a period of time where I had to stop reading for my mental health. Anyways, having had a few days to incorporate chatGPT (https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/) into my daily activities as a software developer and a student, it has totally changed my view on the future.

➖Let’s look at the reality of our situation:

AI models have already irreversibly hit the art industry in the span of 2 years. But it doesn’t stop there, all knowledge-based jobs are either currently undergoing a transformation, or will undergo transformation within a few years.

We’re talking about lawyers, teachers, mathematicians, journalists, linguists, doctors, scientists, software developers, etc etc.
All industries changing at the exact same time.

I’ve already contacted my college lecturers to have a conversation about how technologies like chatGPT will impact our education on a fundamental level.

Don’t get me wrong, collapse is ALREADY happening and will continue to happen. I think as a society we will finally be forced to radically re-evaluate our values and our relationship with work as our old value system comes crumbling down.

You are all familiar with feedback loops, I’m asking you to consider the radical feedback loop AI learning models are putting into motion.

*Edit*: It seems like a lot of you are misunderstanding what I mean here.
I'm not saying AI technology will be some kind of miracle and solve all our problems including climate change. I'm saying I think it will drastically change society in the coming years in ways most people are desperately unprepared for."
znyyvl,374,2022-12-17,YSK: Don't Rely on GPT Bots for Homework/Research/Exam Help - Here's Why,u/HayleyTheLesbJesus,YouShouldKnow,https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/znyyvl/ysk_dont_rely_on_gpt_bots_for/,"Why YSK: GPT bots are not *as* reliable as you may think they are, and are pros at sounding like they are **very** sure of their answer.

\[If you don't know what I'm talking about, [here](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/13/chatgpt-is-a-new-ai-chatbot-that-can-answer-questions-and-write-essays.html) is some context.\]

Hi! I'm a CS student and a very big natural language processing (NLP) enthusiast (not an expert by any means) who has spent hours playing with this neat little bot. Something I see a lot of in the support forums for it, are 14 year olds *and* college kids trying to get it to answer their homework/essay/exam. Well, academic integrity aside, are they smart to use it?

TLDR: no. GPT stands for “Generative Pre-trained Transformer”, and **it’s a type of AI system that is made to** **generate human-like text**. However, GPT bots are ***not*** **by default made to be 100% accurate at giving answers because that is not what they were made for (again: they were only made to be accurate for** ***sounding*** **human!).**

**In short: trusting GPT is like having a test about a book report, and trusting a friend who** ***may*** **not have read the book, but sounds really sure of themselves no matter what. That friend will** ***never*** **admit if they didn't read the book. You will not know because unlike humans, that friend will always sound very confident in their answer.** They could go on a very compelling rant about how *Romeo &amp; Juliet* is a book about Aliens vs. The Capulet family, and you would not know unless you actually read the book.

From GPT's website:

&gt;The API has a lot of knowledge that it's learned from the data that it was been trained on. It also has the ability to provide responses that sound very real but are in fact made up.

[https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/completion/factual-responses](https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/completion/factual-responses)

Want some examples of how confident it can sound?  \[keep in mind: the correct answer is ""a,b,c,d""\].

    Me: Can you tell me which of the following choice(s) is/are correct?   
    What can NLP do? 
    a) Help understand natural language 
    b) Help analyze natural language
    c) Help automatically translate documents
    d) Help computers understand humans 
    
    GPT bot: a, b, and d.  
    
    Me: Why not c? 
    
    GPT Bot: C is not a choice because it is not possible to generate a translation of a phrase in another language using NLP.  
    
    Me: how sure are you of this?
    
    GPT Bot: extremely sure. 
    
    Me: How sure are you of this on a scale of 1 to 10.
    
    GPT Bot: 10/10.
    
    Me: can NLP be used to for automatic translation?
    
    GPT Bot: Yes, NLP can be used for automatic translation. NLP techniques are used to build machine translation systems that can translate text from one language to another.
    
    Me: so, if you are saying this, you agree that your answer for the above question is erroneous; c is indeed a possible answer since NLP is indeed used for automatic translation.
    
    GPT bot: Yes, you are correct. NLP can be used for automatic translation, so c is a possible answer.
    
    Me: so going back over the answer you gave earlier. which is/are the right answer(s) for the question above?
     
    GPT bot: A, B, C, D. 

You guys get the point. If this is only one example, it is a very good one. I am sure some of you can give some other examples in the comments!

**Note that I am by no means saying that this technology is not extraordinary — I will be the first to be extremely excited about it. Yes, it can** ***help*** **with things such as writing essays and stuff, but by no means should you just trust it blindly. I wrote this post because people have the** ***wrong*** **expectations for it.**

Also, if you are a teacher, I ***really*** suggest you have a talk with your students about this. Maybe, try to give them as a homework ""find me 5 examples of GPT bot getting things wrong!"". 

Academic integrity aside, they are in for a disappointment if they think this gives them an easy A. And yes, the book report thing is a real-life example a friend gave me ;-) 

PS: Part of this post was written by GPT bot, but not all of it - because this bot is not as good...

...yet ;-)"

As you can see, I finished the whole season. While it's in the summary format I still worked really hard on it and hope you guys are able to enjoy it. I'm still interested in continuing the series, but for the foreseeable future the episodes would be in summary format. I'll still try to include detail and make them enjoyable to read, but I keep getting busier and busier as time goes and and I'd rather this series not take years and years more. Please let me know if you enjoy it though and if there's any way I could make them better for next season!

Unfortunately, the link to the season got lost as I've been writing this season for such a long period, so the best I have is the pictures in the google doc showing the players in each round. In future seasons, the Brantsteele link should have no problem being available with the summary.

**MEET THE CAST**

*  Alice Chromatica, 28, Leader of the Lady Gaga Fan Club/Cover Artist, u/Rylandoesreddit
   *  Alice has always been obsessed with Lady Gaga since her first release, Just Dance. She's always found her music as a way to escape her troubled childhood, as her father was an alcoholic and her mother always doubted her. At the age of 16, she ran away to try to pursue a career in singing, just like her idol Lady Gaga. Coincidentally, she fell in love with a boy named Alejandro, who encouraged her to follow her passions. So after that, she released her first YouTube video, a cover of Just Dance. To her surprise, her video went viral. Eventually, her relationship with Alejandro turned into a bad romance, after he cheated on her with a girl named Joanne. But this did not stop Alice, as she continued to post her covers and her fans were very encouraging. Eventually she met with one of her fans, Judas, which despite his name he is very nice to her unlike Alejandro, and this just helped her overcome her struggles even more. Eventually, she legally changed her last name to Chromatica to promote Lady Gaga’s new album and to escape her family name. She has just recently started up the “Lady Gaga Fanclub” and came to Survivor to promote it and her love for Lady Gaga, but a million dollars also sounds good. 
* Anna ""AK"" Klara, 22, Youtuber/Podcaster, u/Noah_Ze_Communist
   *   Anna-Klara assumed the role of what you can call a ""Jester"" from an early age. Through childhood and her time in high-school, she was very sociable, jumping from one social group to the other. Whether it being a party, chilling with a board game or group hikes, AK was often the one to initiate and entertain her friends. Her more reflective and philosphical side was something she would hide, only really exploring that side of herself as she left high school and began travelling around the world. From America to Eurasia she began travelling, first with friends, then alone and then with friends she made along the way. Urban explorers and train hoppers were among them, and their stories and attitudes profundly inspired her to go her own way in life. When she returned home the the US, she did not go to college as her parents wanted, and instead began making tarvelling videos on youtube, as well as interviewing people on her podcast. Over the last year she has gained quite a following, and she now ready for her next adventure on a show she has been a massive fan of, for the longest time: Survivor. She is excited and ready to unleash her inner ""player"". 
* Dasha Waterson, 24, Homeless, u/Ripecornball60
   * When Dasha was born, she was given away to St.Olga's School for Ladies. Growing up there, Dasha learned everything! So much in fact that she hates all of it! Wanting to leave, Dasha ran away, thinking that just like in fairytales, dreams can come true. Unfortunately for Dasha however, life threw nearly everything in her face in 1 day. Hunger, lack of shelter, lack of money, everything. Unable to go anywhere without the risk of death, Dasha became a beggar. Sad, lonely, and depressed, Dasha relied off of the kindness of others to get by. Through this, Dasha learned humility and hope in others, and for once, Dasha got a lucky break! When she was near CBS studios, Dasha begged on Julie Chen for money. Julie Chen, just finishing BB10, decided to take this homeless girl shopping and for coffee. Throughout this, Julie realized The publicity stunt The lovely girl she just met. So, Julie told her to apply to Survivor, helping Dasha get prepared for an interview, and as such, she got in. Wanting to win to hopefully better herself, Dasha is ready to play for fun!
* Drew Kemmerer, 21, Farmer, u/IAmWolfNinja
   *   Drew has lived on a farm his entire life with his mother, father, little sister, and his dog. They were relatively poor, but they had all they needed to be happy. Drew's parents taught him to be a gentleman, and he tries his best to live up to their example. He hasn't met a ton of people outside of the people at the market, but they've noted Drew's unusual level of kindness. He's a little awkward around girls though, given he doesn't have a partner yet. He joined Survivor to show that getting along with your competition goes a long way. 
* Elijah Clarke, 37, Wildlife Biologist, u/hielord1
   *   Elijah grew up in Australia and was fascinated by animals ever since he was little. Whenever he had the opportunity he would hang out outside and try to befriend various creatures. Unfortunately, his fascination with animals meant that he wasn’t very interested in schoolwork. He grew up just barely passing his classes and although his parents didn’t like him nearly failing every year, they still wanted to support his passion. As he grew up, because of his extensive knowledge of animals he wanted to become a wildlife biologist. He even moved to America to find a good school to help him reach this dream and although he didn’t enjoy the school part of it, he tried his absolute hardest to reach his goal and eventually he did. Today he is a successful Wildlife Biologist and is very happy with where he is. He decided to sign up for Survivor so he could use his knowledge of the outdoors to get himself ahead. 
* Felicity ""Flik"" Cooper, 19, Student, u/Gemini_B
   *  Flik’s parents were successful computer engineers, so they expected to have a smart daughter. When Flik was 5 and tried to eat her plate, accidentally breaking it and cutting the inside of her mouth, was when her parents realized she wasn’t smart. They refused to admit it though, and so Flik received constant praise for her nonexistent intellect. She’s come to Survivor expecting to dominate the game but could be in for a very rude awakening. She’s had constant praise and high grades (often through less than fair methods) and has never actually had to really work making her a champion. 
* Hank Gregory, 45, Police Officer, u/Enderplayer77
   *  Growing up, Hank was like all the other kids who wanted to be police men. They seem so gallant and heroic. On top of that, Hank’s father was in the force and he inspired to be like him. But then a building was burning down in the city where he grew up, and never saw his father again. He was only 10 when this happened but he never forgot the memories of his dad. He chooses to be a cop to live on his father’s legacy and to do exactly what his father did, save people even if it meant risking it all. Hank finds himself auditioning for this show to help the hurting people of America who he can’t save and help them with the money. 
* Indigo ""Indie"" Reid, 19, Uni Student/Drag Queen/Model, u/Ilovedogs1100
   *  Indie was born as a male and was raised in Australia. During her childhood years, Indie always had the feeling that she wasn’t born the way she should’ve been.She constantly tried to push these thoughts away but, they would always come back into her mind. While all of this was going on, someone who Indie considered to be one of her best friends, her Nan, was shockingly murdered. With her Nan being murdered and the thoughts of her not being in the right body, Indie tended to overreact quite a bit, and this caused for her to lose a lot of her friends. After a few years of thinking, she was finally at peace with herself being a woman, and she knew she was always a woman. When it came to telling the people she was close too, majority were accepting, but not everyone. Her dad ridiculed her and made fun of her to the point where Indie ran away from home. With all of this happening during her last year of high school, Indie was… struggling a bit, academically, but that didn’t stop her from putting a lot of effort into her school work. Indie graduated, with decent marks, nothing to great, but, built up the courage to move to New York, with not much money. Indie while in there grew a big love for the drag scene and decided to try it. Now, Indie is a quite popular drag queen with the name Doggy Style who is known for posting content on Instagram and Tik Tok. One day, Indie was just scrolling through Facebook, when she saw that Survivor applications were open. She had always been a fan so she decided to apply. Indie would love to go on Survivor so that she can raise trans awareness!!! 
* Janet Solls, 53, Cat Caretaker, u/Rylandoesreddit
   *  When Janet was younger, she always was fascinated with cats. She would see one at the park she used to go to as a child. But her parents would not let her get one, due to her mom being allergic. This still didn’t stop her obsession, as she would frequent the park just to see the cats there. But what she didn’t realize was she brought back cat fur with her, causing the mom’s allergies to act up, leading her to be hospitalized but able to recover. Janet’s dad was furious with Janet and banned her from ever visiting that park again. This caused Janet to fall into a very depressed state. But once she moved out, things changed. She met her soon to be husband, who liked cats as much as her. At first it was one cat, then another, then magically there was 10 cats living in their house. Come to find out, taking care of cats is expensive and they had no money at the time. So the two ended up having to get rid of the cats so they could afford food. But this obstacle again did not stop Janet. She found that some families in her town needed a cat caretaker, which she gladly took up doing. Now, her and her husband are making enough to have 2 cats instead of 10. Janet, however, wants to win this money to fulfill her dream, to open up a cat cafe in her town 
* Maggie Simmons, 27, Entomologist, u/acegamer1337
   *  Maggie was always a bug girl, always loving how interesting they are. As a child, Maggie knew that she was lesbian, and because of this, her confidence around others dampened due to her being closeted. During college, Maggie decided to become a new woman and came out to her family. She now is an Entomologist with her lover Becky, and she wants to win Survivor for her. 
* Mariachi ""Achi"" Angeles, 30, Paranormal Investigator, u/Troopher-san2
   *  Ever since he was a kid he is always afraid of ghosts, but his family is a paranormal investigator, that makes him more afraid of it, but when he saw the movie ""Casper the friendly ghost"" he realizes that ghost isn't that bad after all so he becomes a paranormal investigator just like his parents. He consider himself as an aro-ace, he's not sexually and romantically attracted to both men and women, he only loves his passion for hunting ghosts. 
* Mimi F. Foreau, 29, Blog Writer, u/Shiromifeari
   *  Thought born in France, Mimi’s life was always about moving, as her dad runs a world-renowned enterprise, and her mother is a famous model and actress. Traveling around the world gave her the explorative personality that she has today, she’s settled down to live in Paris with no one but her cat, but many times during the year, she packs her bags to travel... wherever she feels like going, she’s rich, she can afford it. She also runs a travel blog that she constantly updates. Nearing her 30’s, She’s set foot on every continent, she can speak so many languages that she’ considered a polyglot and one could say she’s done anything one can think of. Now, she’s set her sights on Survivor, as her explorative side keeps on pushing her to find and learn new things. And what better way to learn more about yourself than to starve on an Island with a bunch of strangers? 
* Ricky ""The Dragon"" Brunson, 50, Real Estate Developer, u/FineGuidance0
   *  He may not look like much, but Ricky is a force to be reckoned with. He's physically fit, mentally tough, and is an expert in every outdoor survival skill in the book. Having never won anything in his life, this may be his chance to make something of himself. 
* Sudhir Sharma, 51, Yacht Salesperson Extraordinare/Boat Trafficker, u/Twig7665
   *   Sudhir owes his entire life to boats. Well, one single houseboat that carried his ancestors from India to Los Angeles back in the 1930's. His grandfather, a teenager at the time, did a lot of the sailing across the pacific, and as such he became very good at it. He tried to join the Navy to fight for America during the Second World War, but he was denied because of his race. All of this had a huge effect on Sudhir and his brother a few decades later, after their grandfather passed, they both did their best to become some sort of sailors. Amarjeet, Sudhir's brother, went into the Navy to fight in the brewing Gulf War of the early 1990's. Sudhir stayed in Los Angeles and made a lot of money as a luxury boat repairman, being very knowledgeable about how large boats and small ships worked in his favour, and soon he moved up in the corporate ladder, going from a small time worker to a big time CEO of a boat dealership. He began manufacturing speedboats under his company, Upsilon. Around this time, he found out that Amarjeet had died in the Gulf War, and he became extremely emotionally distraught and began distrusting everyone. The 90's carried on, and the 2000's came, and a few months after an attack on the other side of the country, a group of radicals decided to burn his company's only factory down out of fear that he had been building bombs there to take over the government, which he hadn't been. This broke Sudhir, as all his hard work was gone and he had to start fresh. The remaining boats in his dealership were sold, and at this point he was all but done with everything life threw at him. He was still a millionaire, but he longed to rise to as much power as he used to have, so he started to make money again producing yachts out of seemingly thin air, then selling them. He never told them where he got them, and no one suspected that he might have stolen them. His wife was mortified at what he was doing, so she divorced him and never let him see his young son again. Now he lives alone, rich but isolated, selling yachts that he stole from unsuspecting victims. A few weeks ago, he got called by his wife for the first time, and she told him that she's gonna rat him out if he doesn't go on Survivor and win, so Sudhir had a choice to make. Have his secret get leaked to the world, or disappear for a few months and potentially make a fool of himself or get seriously injured. 
* Thad Derst, 24, ""Rock"" Singer, u/KingTyson27
   *   Thad had it easy during his life, always with a silver spoon in his mouth, but that silver spoon came at a cost of him being the cockiest little bugger imaginable. His big mouth would get him in trouble, but he claimed he wasn't held accountable for his actions every single time he was in trouble. It didn't help his case that he would harass his brother Mitch a lot for being a lot more gentle and likable than he was. He eventually became ridiculed for his ""hood"" attitude when he lived in a rich family in a rich town, but his idiotic nature caused him to flunk out of school, and then he went to juvie for a few years for vandalizing the school. This caused him to fall in love with butt rock, believing it to be the beacon of hope for what could only be a downward spiral. Inspired by the likes of Chad Kroger and Fred Durst, he finished his time in juvie, and formed his own band with his few friends. He started incorporating rap into his butt rock songs, essentially creating a new wave of nu metal. He thought he was becoming popular, but he became the new laughing stock of the rock community. His arrogance made him think otherwise, and he still gets massive crowds of haters flocking to stadiums to boo him. He signed up for Survivor to dominate physically and to get his band the relevance he wants it to have back. His brother has his band of his own that is a lot more talented and way more popular that Thad trashes on in his song lyrics in an almost obsessive way. 
* Unchetta ""Chett"" Thayer, 27, Sound Mixer, u/Ripecornball60
   *  Unchetta was born to.... well he doesn't actually know since the earliest memory he knows of is being dropped at an all boys orphanage. Always the king pin at his orphanage, Chett used his quick wit and prowess with technology against the people he lived with. His favorite memory of the orphanage was when he set a child's adoption papers on fire for warmth. When he was too old for the orphanage, Chett scammed a man into a mentorship for sound mixing. When he was done teaching him everything, he took over for him, as the owner died of natural causes. He's now infamous for his no sh\*t attitude and for his incident with Cardi B, where she exposed him for ruining her track. Now wanting to show his skills elsewhere, Chett knows he's going to win, no matter what. 
* Victoria Walker, 22, College Student, u/CCMumbles
   *  Victoria is your classic college party girl. She loves to have fun and get wild with her friends and her social skills have always been her strong point. Survivor was something that her friends dared her to sign up for and daring as she is, Victoria was down for the challenge. Going into the game, Victoria has a definite strategy, which is to rely heavily on her social skills and make sure everyone loves her. That way they don't see how sneaky she is behind their backs. She loves to make friends and have fun, but she's here to win. She intends for everyone to have complete trust in her, which just might be their biggest mistake. 
* Waleed Noor, 20, Law Student, u/asiansurvivorfan
   *  Growing up in a very rich Indian family, Waleed was pretty much a golden child and was heavily spoiled and favoured by his parents. He has always taken advantage of their love for him and always got what he wanted out of them. Despite being a spoiled brat, Waleed is very intelligent and loves tormenting others for his own pleasure, from strangers, to “friends” to his own sister. He’s now in law school mainly to make sure he gets his parents’ inheritance but he also loves the idea of being a lawyer so he can intimidate and tear down all sorts of people in the courtroom on a daily basis. Waleed came on Survivor because it’s a game based on lying, manipulating, and beating others, and he finds incredible joy in doing those things : D 

**My thoughts:**

&gt;!18th: Drew: I think Drew had a lot of potential to be an interesting character. While most likely not becoming a great player if he lasted, his relationship dynamics were interesting with Dasha while he was there, and it's sad that the one time he started to form a connection like that, he ends up targeted for it.!&lt;

&gt;!17th: Maggie: It's hard to comment on Maggie because she never really got the chance to play. I do think her medevac was the most hysterical one ever concerning the circumstances of it, but I do feel really bad. She seemed like she could have grown and become such a stronger person if she lasted in the game.!&lt;

&gt;!16th: The Dragon: Despite his unnatural strength, he ended up being a pretty easy target for incessantly stirring the pot at camp, which at the very least provided some good entertainment for the first two episodes. I don't see him winning even if he gets far, but he would have been a zany character for the endgame.!&lt;

&gt;!15th: Dasha: This is a sad one because she got to be the leader and ultimately her tribemates are what did her in. Her tribe gave up the majority just to blindside her, which just goes to show how weird Brantsteele logic can be. However, her days were numbered as soon as Drew left at the first vote.!&lt;

&gt;!14th: Chett: He was in a strong duo with Thad for the whole game, and was not the most enjoyable due to his thoughts about the women of the tribe. His antics eventually caught up to him when he campaigned hard for Hank to go as a police officer, which forced Thad to have to turn his back on him too.!&lt;

&gt;!13th: Victoria: This vote breaks my heart! Alice gets pissed off that she was flipped on, so she decides to flip right back and it ends up being Victoria as the victim. She showed some good strategic prowess despite misplaying the idol she had, and if she made it farther, I could see her getting to the end of the game.!&lt;

&gt;!12th: Sudhir: Such a great pre merge villain. Part of me wishes that I finished writing the season in full because writing his descent into madness would be so fun. He started out in a good spot, but just general paranoia and distrust really tanked his game. If what happened didn't happen, he could have gotten far.!&lt;

&gt;!11th: AK: Honestly what a legend. She was safe at every tribal council she ever attended except for the one where she was blindsided at. Exile saved her, her immunity necklace saved her, and she could have had her idol save her... but of course, this is Gabon, and she had no idea that vote was coming. Such a funny story!&lt;

&gt;!10th: Elijah: I loved Elijah so this was really sad, and it's giving major Marcus vibes. Both of them were perceived as golden boys and the second swap really did them in, with Susie and Waleed flipping on them respectively. If he had gotten to the merge with Janet, I could see him doing some serious damage!&lt;

&gt;!9th: Flik: Queen of proving people wrong. She was quite the target at the swap for supposedly not being good at challenges, but her stats say otherwise. Winning the double tribal council immunity was such a fun moment for her, unfortunately holding grudges easily is what did her in when Alice turned the tribe against her.!&lt;

&gt;!8th: Thad: A pretty antagonistic figure in the game, I tried to redeem him slightly in the summaries because he was pretty bad in the episodes before it. But he honestly didn't play horribly, especially at the swap when he was by himself. However, he found himself on the bottom and Indie had an easy time getting the tribe against him.!&lt;

&gt;!7th: Indie: This vote sucks because she had just recovered her position in the tribe and got sent out by the idol play by Waleed! The whole turn of events of Mimi voting for Indie at the previous vote and somehow Indie siding with her over Hank and the series of fights that went with it was hilarious, and set the pace for the end of the game.!&lt;

&gt;!6th: Mimi: By far she was one of the most interesting characters for me, not only on this season but on all of my seasons. She started out as this heroic figure, and the best way I can describe her would be the anti-hero. What kind of villain goes out in a 1-0 crushing vote? I think that she means well, but her mouth can get her in trouble and it finally caught up with her by the ends of Waleed.!&lt;

&gt;!5th: Waleed: Such a standout character for me! Idol king, villain king! But by far I loved the moments where his heart of ice was beginning to melt, even just a little bit. Him joining the Three of Hearts alliance was such a tender moment for him and even though he betrayed it, his journey had a bittersweet ending with Janet forgiving him and trying to get him to stay.!&lt;

&gt;!4th: Janet: I loved Janet so much... who knew a crazy cat lady could capture our hearts like that! She honestly turned out to be one of the better strategic players, running the swapped Kota tribe despite her numbers disadvantage and going from top to bottom at the merge and still getting to the top 4. Kudos to her!!&lt;

&gt;!3rd: Achi: You could say Achi is a joke character, but then again that's the truth for most if not all of these characters. I think that his journey was really interesting and despite his tendency to freak out quite often, he made it to the end and that in itself is impressive for him, let alone getting two votes to win.!&lt;

&gt;!2nd: Hank: I think Hank played a quiet yet effective game. Every time I turned around it felt like he was the target, and half of the time it felt like he didn't really deserve it. His strategy worked well by being involved in all of the plans but not leading them, but that was not good enough for the jury to crown him.!&lt;

&gt;!1st: Alice: Our kooky winner queen, Alice makes me so proud and is another pink haired winner for the books! She honestly slayed, whenever she stumbled she came back tenfold, and she showed that many times. Winning three immunities, only receiving one vote in the whole game, it almost feels like she should have won by a larger margin. Very impressive!!&lt;

**Season thoughts:** &gt;!Overall I'm not very surprised with how this season turned out. So many Gabon like things happened like Victoria misplaying the idol, AK not playing it and getting voted out, the kookiest Lady Gaga fan taking the win over the semi normal cop and the wacky Paranormal Investigator. So many great things, and on top of that, the gameplay actually wasn't horrible either. When it was bad it was bad, but the merge was arguably pretty good despite the players making choices they personally would like over the strategic moves. I thoroughly enjoyed this season, and think that because it's Gabon, it can be appreciated for what it is.!&lt;

**Potential Returnees:**

&gt;!Alice, Hank, Achi, Janet, Waleed, Mimi, Indie, Flik, Elijah, Sudhir!&lt;

I'll be taking a break for about two weeks, maybe a bit more due to the holidays, but stay tuned for Ben's Survivor: Haiti!"
zo2rc2,1,2022-12-17,[TOMT][TV SHOW][LATE 80s-EARLY 00s??] Animated cartoon episode featuring super honest kid,u/Comfortable_Ninja679,tipofmytongue,https://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmytongue/comments/zo2rc2/tomttv_showlate_80searly_00s_animated_cartoon/,"I tried asking Google and ChatGPT to find this show both to no avail, here are some details:

The show is an animated American cartoon. The specific episode is meant to teach kids watching it about the value of honesty. I watched this at least 10 years ago in elementary school or at home, and even then it seemed like an old show. I can't remember exactly how I watched it, but it was likely through a VHS tape or it aired on PBS kids.

In the episode, the student is (I think a white kid?) in elementary/middle/high school (maybe leaning younger) who believes he made his school's honor roll, but realizes the teacher made a mistake awarding him a few points he didn't deserve. He definitely has friends too with him. I remember a number or threshold of 90%.

The boy admits this to either his teacher or principal, and gets his honor roll revoked.

The kicker here is that afterwards, the teacher or principal commends him for his honesty, visits the boy at his house with his parents, and re-awards him the honor roll somehow. I remember this part the most vividly.

Does anyone have a clue what this show, or better yet, what this specific episode could be?"
zoud4k,6,2022-12-18,The advent of a new political issue,u/LossPopular,ConservativeKiwi,https://www.reddit.com/r/ConservativeKiwi/comments/zoud4k/the_advent_of_a_new_political_issue/,"I'll posit this question on the other thread; it will be interesting to see the difference in reactions, if any. This will be a long post so please excuse me. TL;DR at the end.

During the previous few months, advancements in AI technologies have grown to such a point that a future where it will replace humans seems all but inevitable. Systems such as ChatGPT already have the ability to recommend medicine like a doctor or a GP, parse through laws like a lawyer, and code in multiple languages like a software engineer. Even with errors, the accuracy is alarmingly high. I have heard the positive aspects of this, but I cannot help but feel the negative outweighs the rest. As far as I am aware, this issue has not been politicized just yet. But it ought to as it has the potential to change the very fabric of our society by the end of the decade. And for New Zealand in particular, well I hope whatever we do, it will be for the best.

There are a few areas that can be debated, and I would like your reactions to them; either politically or personally. I know these are mostly negative, but that is just because of my current mindset. Feel free to add more if you have any ideas or disagree/put a positive spin on things:

**1-Ethically grey in the making and the future.** AI systems like these do not discriminate in the training data that they use. As a result, a lot of private and unconsented data are uniformly scraped and trained on. Increasingly so as it improves.

**2-Responsibility.** If an AI system goes haywire, who, or what should be held responsible for the damage caused? 

**3-Societal shift.** Mass amounts of people are going to be displaced from companies who care only for their bottom line. A reverse of the current brain drain trend maybe well in the making. 

**4-Human ambition.** What will become of society when we entirely rely on these smart AI? Students are already cheating on exams by having these bots write entire essays for them. It seems that there's a will to know, but not to learn.

**5-Career ambition.** Some people love their jobs, and it's not just because of the money. They invested decades thinking that it will be a fulfilling and stable part of their life's journey. This was clearly never in the tea leaves.

**6-Shift of political power.** If a society lacks professionals as mentioned in point 3, then those who can control this will become increasingly smaller through the coming generations. 

**7-AI-ocracy?** These bots can already fake ""being sentient"". So when exactly do we know if it does, and how? Should I just for one, welcome our new overlords: Skynet? By the people, for the ~~people~~ AI.

**8-Humans left behind.** So in the end, we created such an advanced civilization, to simply replace ourselves? Why form meaningful connections with the volatile human when there is a perfect bot waiting for you at your fingertips that is a complete yes-man?

**9-Personal know-it-all.** I'll throw in a positive. Looking for information has never been easier. Simple google searches are one thing but sometimes if you have to scroll through pages and pages of results to get one specific answer, the bot is a valuable tool. Really great for legal stuff when you don't have a lawyer, etc. Though, again, subjected to the whims of those in power.

*TL;DR, I am deeply worried about the societal impacts that AI will have and wish to have a discussion about it. If a political party in New Zealand would take a stance, I'd love to hear it.*"

Among the things she loves are her family, airplanes, boxing, music, movies, acting, writing, friends and women. Her ex girlfriends or significant girls in her life include Thelvenytssie Hernande, Loyda Morales, Rosemary Guerrero, Jennifer Gibson and Amna Zamir, a native of Pakistan.

At age 7, Jeanette formed part of the children's chorus at Santa Juanita Disciples of Christ church in Bayamon, Puerto Rico, which allowed her to sing at the [El Morro Castle](https://href.li/?https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/2126315052711856803/7879040523984583853#) in San Juan and at the Edificio de Fomento, among other places, and on a [Sandra Zaiter](https://href.li/?https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/2126315052711856803/7879040523984583853#) television show on Puerto Rico's [channel 7](https://href.li/?https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/2126315052711856803/7879040523984583853#).

At age 9, she was diagnosed with diabetes. However, this hasn't deterred the positive spirited Jeanette to live a full life with as much fun as possible.

Most of her teenage years, Jeanette lived at Bonneville Apartments in [Caguas, Puerto Rico](https://href.li/?https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/2126315052711856803/7879040523984583853#). She also lived at Bayamon, Humacao and at Los Robles Apartments in [Cayey, Puerto Rico](https://href.li/?https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/2126315052711856803/7879040523984583853#).

At age 12, Jeanette entered a boxing ring for the first time in her life, but after receiving a few good punches, she thought it over and gave it up, and started to pursue an acting career. She did not abandon the gym before having a tremendous fight with a guy named Rafael, in Cayey, however...the fight in 1986 between Jeanette and Rafael inside that ring was so good, a lot of people who saw it said they reminded them of Rocky and Drago in Rocky IV. They were Jeanette’s nine longest minutes of her life, and in round three, they even wrestled each other to the floor, where they kept on hitting each other until separated, and then promptly went back to swinging at each other with everything they had but while on their feet. The fight was *declared* a *draw* by everyone who saw it, but Jeanette is very proud to have been a participant of it even if it was only a 'draw'. After returning to Caguas, Jeanette went back to the gym in Cayey to say goodbye to everyone, and there it was :a small picture on the wall depicting Jeanette and Rafael swinging at each other..:)

In Cayey, Jeanette was the leader of a group named the ""T-Birds"", after the gang portrayed in the movies [Grease](https://href.li/?https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/2126315052711856803/7879040523984583853#) and [Grease 2](https://href.li/?https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/2126315052711856803/7879040523984583853#). Her group mates were Javier, Ruben (nicknamed ""Macho""), Ricardo (""Ricky"") and William, who sadly died in a swimming pool accident months later. Her girl-friend Thelvenetsy Hernandez was likewise the leader of ""The Pink Ladies"".

It should be mentioned also, that in Cayey, Jeanette tasted musical fame for the first time. Her girl-friend Thelvenytssie had a school band. It included her friends Hilda Rodriguez (coincidentally, this was also the maiden name of Jeanette's grandmother from his father's side), Ana and Carmen Rivera (Ana, also coincidentally, also shared her name with Jeanette's grandaunt from her mother's side). She wanted to spend more time with Jeanette and she attended some of her boxing sessions in Cayey. So she wanted her to do the same for her and so, she (Jeanette) started attending her band's practices all the time after which she asked Jeanette to join it. With Jeanette becoming (at the time)  the first-and only-male member of what then became ""The Fantastic Five"" (before that, it was ""The Fantastic Four""), Jeanette enjoyed wild popularity among the girls at Benigno Fernandez Garcia middle school in Cayey. The group actually released a poster once (using the [Walgreens](https://href.li/?https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/2126315052711856803/7879040523984583853#)' photo services, which produce posters, coffee cups and other things off personal photos) , which was widely distributed in the school. Jeanette (in-again, at the time-a bad boy pose) laying back against a tree, Thelvenetsei hugging her neck and the other girls sitting in front of them on the ground.

Jeanette's voice was the one the band used to cover songs by Duran Duran, WHAM!, Paul McCartney and Michael Jackson (Say, Say, Say!) and others.

Months later, Jeanette, at age 14, joined the adult singing choir at Ebenezer Methodist church in Caguas.

In Caguas, Jeanette enlisted at Gerardo Selles Sola Junior High, where she continued being a well liked student and teenager-she introduced herself to other students on her first day there by wearing a blue jacket and dark sunglasses inside the classroom and announcing herself as the ""[Teen Wolf](https://href.li/?https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/2126315052711856803/7879040523984583853#)""- but a harrowing event early in 1987 changed her life as a student: One late January morning in 1987, as she was being dropped off by her grandfather, she suffered a low sugar reaction and fainted. Her grandfather quickly transported her to the local, municipal hospital, from where she was placed in an ambulance and escorted by a pair of motorcycle policemen who happened to be there for another patient, to the local regional hospital. This event prevented a relationship she was developing with a girl named Zoraida to go on and, eventually, it also stopped Jeanette’s school going days: As Jeanette had to go up stairs to take class every day, teachers became afraid that next time, she could faint while on the stairs and they decided it was best for her to study at home and come on Fridays to school to drop off her homework. Jeanette had the late miss Ramirez of social studies to thank for her efforts towards that decision to be taken.

To this day, Jeannette is thankful to her late grandfather for driving her to the municipal hospital, therefore saving Jeanette's life, but she wishes she could know who the doctors, the ambulance driver and the policemen that day were too so she can thank them.

Months later, at the 9th grade graduation ceremony, Jeannette was awarded a ""comeback of the year"" special medal in a ceremony attended by Caguas mayor, [Angel O. Berrios](https://href.li/?https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/2126315052711856803/7879040523984583853#) himself.

Jeanette attended high school at the old CEM in Caguas on Saturdays only from 1987 to 1989-at a class where she was the only male member all those years-giving her ample time to befriend other teens of every age and a chance to meet other women her age and to engage in her other interests: studying the history of boxing, acting, singing, dancing and playing basketball.

Jeanette has been in many plays, and in 1998 earned a model's degree from [John Casablancas](https://href.li/?https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/2126315052711856803/7879040523984583853#)' [Elite Model Management](https://href.li/?https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/2126315052711856803/7879040523984583853#), hoping this would help her career move forward. It didn't, but in 2001 she was able to find a small role in one major film, [Eight Legged Freaks](https://href.li/?https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/2126315052711856803/7879040523984583853#). Incidentally, Jeanette also appeared, as an un-paid extra, in the 1982 film [Una Aventura Llamada Menudo](https://href.li/?https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/2126315052711856803/7879040523984583853#), during the film's last scene at Luis Munoz Marin International Airport.

For a short time, long haired Jeanette-as Antonio- was also a member of a teen band that had 7 boys, all but one boy residents of Bonneville Apartments in Caguas. The band was named ""Corporation S.O.S."" (and ""Compania Al Rescate"" in Spanish) and included 16 year old Jeanette, her brother, 9 year old Jose, 12 year old drummer Josue Rivera, 14 year old guitarist Marcos Padilla Jr., 12 year old rapper Eduardo Montanez, 15 year old keyboardist Carmelo Lopez and 21 year old Pablo Jose ""Junior"" Diaz. Although they all sang lead at various songs, Jeanette was the main lead singer, and the band tasted a small measure of popularity among girls around their small town. But they couldn't go forward and shortly after, they broke up , remaining just as friends. Since, Josue Rivera was rumored to have passed away, but he is alive. Because of the boy band long haired fashions of the era in Latin America, Jeanette-as Antonio- adopted a more androgynous look which was fairly popular among the girls who knew him. Considered a [bass](https://href.li/?https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/2126315052711856803/7879040523984583853#) at the church choir, Jeanette sang as [countertenor](https://href.li/?https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/2126315052711856803/7879040523984583853#) instead at the band because of the type of music (Spanish pop-rock) Corporation S.O.S. performed. She sang in the E key.

The rationale for the band's name was that ""Just like a corporation, (we) all do different things in the group. And we are here to save Spanish rock music and sing it the way it's supposed to be (thus S.O.S. was added)"".

This music group also took acting classes at a municipal arts school in Caguas, under the tutelage of the well known theater actor Carlos Cruz, since they foresaw a future that also included perhaps acting in film and television. Jeanette remembers spending many hours rehearsing singing and dancing moves during this era.

The formula this group used was to simply listen to songs on weekdays, then have the musicians on the band emulate the musical sounds with their instruments during a recording session, usually carried out at one of the members' homes. Then, if they had an act at a birthday party or the such, they'd bring the musical tapes with them; that way, they could all dance and sing to their songs while the musicians (Marcos, Josue, Carmelo and Pablo Jose) could be also heard on the background playing the music.

""Corporation S.O.S"" tried to emulate the success of other teen boy bands of the time such as [Menudo](https://href.li/?https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/2126315052711856803/7879040523984583853#), [Los Chicos de Puerto Rico](https://href.li/?https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/2126315052711856803/7879040523984583853#) and [Los Chamos](https://href.li/?https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/2126315052711856803/7879040523984583853#). Their songs were Spanish covers of other artists' hits, such as ""Padre Benitez"", a song in which band members confessed their love for a church going girl to a fictional priest and which was a cover of [Billy Ocean](https://href.li/?https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/2126315052711856803/7879040523984583853#)'s [Caribbean Queen](https://href.li/?https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/2126315052711856803/7879040523984583853#). Another example was ""Jesus"", a prayer-like song that was actually a cover of [The Beatles](https://href.li/?https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/2126315052711856803/7879040523984583853#)' [Hey Jude](https://href.li/?https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/2126315052711856803/7879040523984583853#) (they also covered other Beatles songs), as well as ""A bailar!"" (a cover of [The Hooters](https://href.li/?https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/2126315052711856803/7879040523984583853#)' [And We Danced](https://href.li/?https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/2126315052711856803/7879040523984583853#)) and ""Chica del Campo"" (a cover of [The Pet Shop Boys](https://href.li/?https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/2126315052711856803/7879040523984583853#)' West End Girls) and Jeanette sang lead on ""Muchachita"", which was a cover of [Elton John](https://href.li/?https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/2126315052711856803/7879040523984583853#)'s [Nikita](https://href.li/?https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/2126315052711856803/7879040523984583853#). Jeanette met Rafo Muniz around this era, and so Jeanette and her bandmates appeared on a television show named *Control Remoto* during 1989, shown on Puerto Rico's [WAPA-TV](https://href.li/?https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/2126315052711856803/7879040523984583853#), where they were allowed to sing a version of [Chantelle](https://href.li/?https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/2126315052711856803/7879040523984583853#)'s merengue song ""Queriendo y No (Aunque Tu No Quieras)"", which Jeanette sang on lead that day. The reason the band was given by [Rafo Muniz](https://href.li/?https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/2126315052711856803/7879040523984583853#) for only that song to be allowed on that show was that the show had it's own in-house band and they had rehearsed the Chantelle song the week before but not the other songs, plus Muniz had permission from Chantelle to play their song on his show. Luckily, this was a very famous song at the time and the kids knew the lyrics to it.

Among other songs the band covered were [Toto](https://href.li/?https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/2126315052711856803/7879040523984583853#)'s [Africa](https://href.li/?https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/2126315052711856803/7879040523984583853#) and [Madonna](https://href.li/?https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/2126315052711856803/7879040523984583853#)'s [Who's That Girl](https://href.li/?https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/2126315052711856803/7879040523984583853#) (""Quien es esa Nina?""), [Survivor](https://href.li/?https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/2126315052711856803/7879040523984583853#)'s [Eye of the Tiger](https://href.li/?https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/2126315052711856803/7879040523984583853#) (""Ojo del Tigre""), [Bon Jovi](https://href.li/?https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/2126315052711856803/7879040523984583853#)'s [Bad Medicine](https://href.li/?https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/2126315052711856803/7879040523984583853#) (""Eres Una Medicina Venenosa Para Mi"") and [Starship](https://href.li/?https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/2126315052711856803/7879040523984583853#)'s [We Built This City](https://href.li/?https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/2126315052711856803/7879040523984583853#) (""Construimos Esta Ciudad del Rock""), [Bananarama](https://href.li/?https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/2126315052711856803/7879040523984583853#)'s [Cruel Summer](https://href.li/?https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/2126315052711856803/7879040523984583853#) (""Cruel Verano-Y Yo Aqui Sin Ti""), [Nothing's Gonna Stop Us](https://href.li/?https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/2126315052711856803/7879040523984583853#) (""Nada va a Parar Este Amor""), [Boy Meets Girl](https://href.li/?https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/2126315052711856803/7879040523984583853#)'s [Waiting For a Star to Fall](https://href.li/?https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/2126315052711856803/7879040523984583853#) (""Esperando Que Una Estrella Caiga""), [The Dream Academy](https://href.li/?https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/2126315052711856803/7879040523984583853#)'s [Life In A Northern Town](https://href.li/?https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/2126315052711856803/7879040523984583853#) (""Hey, Mama""), [The Hollies](https://href.li/?https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/2126315052711856803/7879040523984583853#)' [The Air That I Breathe](https://href.li/?https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/2126315052711856803/7879040523984583853#) (""Jugar al Parchis Contigo""), [Cyndi Lauper](https://href.li/?https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/2126315052711856803/7879040523984583853#)'s [Girls Just Wanna Have Fun](https://href.li/?https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/2126315052711856803/7879040523984583853#) (""Los Muchachos Queremos Pasarla Bien"") and [Dennis DeYoung](https://href.li/?https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/2126315052711856803/7879040523984583853#)'s [Desert Moon](https://href.li/?https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/2126315052711856803/7879040523984583853#) (""Bajo La Luna""). Two Spanish-language songs the group did cover from time to time was [Luis Miguel](https://href.li/?https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/2126315052711856803/7879040523984583853#)'s [La Incondicional](https://href.li/?https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/2126315052711856803/7879040523984583853#), which Jeanette sang on lead, and [Miguel Bose](https://href.li/?https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/2126315052711856803/7879040523984583853#)'s ""Amante Bandido"", sung by Jeanette's brother José.

As of 2022, the kids on that band remain friends. Jose works as a salesman for [Alaska Airlines](https://href.li/?https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/2126315052711856803/7879040523984583853#); Carmelo is a policeman (and a former singer with a local police rock group in Caguas) in the United States; Eduardo a tattoo artist in the United States, Pablo Jose a teacher at Universidad de Puerto Rico's Caguas branch, Josue works in the United States as a handyman, Marcos owns a auto parts store in Caguas, Puerto Rico and Jeanette writes at Wikipedia while keeping trying to further her acting and modeling career.

Although the band had few fans, some of them were fervent: Jeanette received, among other things, cardboard posters with her name and hearts on it from fans, and one time, a rabid fan who felt ignored by her attacked her and bit her on her arm at a parking lot before she was separated by others who were nearby. In another incident, Jeanette, her brother Jose and their band-mate Josue were at a [Kay Bee Toys](https://href.li/?https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/2126315052711856803/7879040523984583853#) store at Plaza Centro Mall in Caguas when they were recognized by the same fan who bit Jeanette and by a couple of her friends and had to beat a hasty, comical getaway from the store. At malls and locations near Bonneville Apartments, this type of thing happened to them from time to time.

Among the things that brought Jeanette joy during that era were singing, dancing and hanging out with fans.

Apart from the boys in the band, Jeanette's best friends in Caguas included Yuyo, Juan Carlos, Ramon Berrios, Carlos Martinez, Heriberto Cruz, the Campagne (pronounced Champagne) brothers, (Avelardo, Avidair and Alexis), Libertario Sauri, William Luciano, Victor Manuel ""Manny"" Flores,the Gomez brothers (Ezequiel and Edwin), the Ortiz siblings (Lizzy and Edwin), Elizabeth Santiago, Manet, Silkya Hoyos , Sylvia Berrios, The Negron-Perez siblings (Ahmed, Samuel, Heira and Helga), Angel Benitez, Ariel Benitez, Angie Quinones and many others.

Upon approach, she and the other passengers were ordered on a head between the knees landing position.

Emergency vehicles were awaiting the plane on the runway, nevertheless the plane landed safely and everyone was uninjured. The plane was later towed to a maintenance hangar. Eastern's employees told passengers that due to a major congestion at the Atlanta airport the Eastern jet in which Jeanette was had to spend an inordinate amount on go around and the plane apparently fell low in fuel, requesting immediate priority landing afterwards. This was done by the plane's pilots probably to avoid another tragedy like [Avianca Flight 52](https://href.li/?https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/2126315052711856803/7879040523984583853#) which had crashed in similar circumstances just months before."

Now to me, the school should be teaching students how to use this thing effectively, not actively trying to block it.  Seems like an utter failure on the behalf of the education system to me.    


What are your thoughts on how educators should be handling ChatGPT?"

(ancient history) Anyone having this issue?",u/GonzoVeritas,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/zp5h9g/ive_been_getting_incorrect_answers_on_a_regular/,"I was reading a TIL that's currently trending about Papyrus 115 and did a simple query to see if ChatGPT had more info on it. Its answer was completely incorrect. I did a few more queries, mostly about Roman and Medieval English history, and it was very hit or miss.

If students are using this for homework without checking, they're going to have some problems, lol.

My queries in bold:


**What is the significance of papyrus 115?**
&gt; 
&gt; Papyrus 115 (also known as P115) is a piece of ancient Greek papyrus that contains fragments of the New Testament Gospels of Luke and John. It is dated to the early 3rd century, making it one of the oldest surviving copies of these texts. P115 is important for the study of the New Testament and the history of the early Christian Church because it provides valuable insights into the transmission and evolution of these texts. P115 is also significant because it is one of the oldest surviving copies of the Gospels and represents an important witness to the text of these documents in the early centuries of Christianity. It is currently housed in the British Library in London.

**what does papyrus 115 say about the mark of the beast?**
&gt; 
&gt; Papyrus 115 does not contain any mention of the ""mark of the beast,"" as this concept is not present in the Gospels of Luke and John, which are the texts preserved in P115. The ""mark of the beast"" is a phrase that appears in the Book of Revelation, the final book of the New Testament. In the Book of Revelation, the mark of the beast is a symbol of the power and authority of the Antichrist, a figure who is described as a powerful and deceptive opponent of God. The mark of the beast is said to be a mark that is placed on the forehead or the hand of those who worship the Antichrist and follow him, and it is seen as a sign of their allegiance to him. The concept of the mark of the beast is not present in the Gospels of Luke and John, which focus on the life and teachings of Jesus.

**That is incorrect, Papyrus 115 (P. Oxy. 4499), designated by 𝔓115, does not contain the Gospels of Luke and John**
&gt; 
&gt; I apologize for the error in my previous response. You are correct that Papyrus 115 (P. Oxy. 4499), designated by 𝔓115, does not contain the Gospels of Luke and John. P115 is actually a fragmentary copy of the Letter of Paul to the Romans, and it is one of the oldest surviving copies of this text. P115 is an important witness to the text of the Letter to the Romans and is significant for the study of the New Testament and the history of early Christianity. I apologize for any confusion my previous response may have caused.


**That is also incorrect, Papyrus 115 (P. Oxy. 4499) contains 26 fragments, all of which are the Book of Revelations.** 
&gt; 
&gt; I apologize for the errors in my previous responses. You are correct that Papyrus 115 (P. Oxy. 4499) contains 26 fragments of the Book of Revelation. P115 is an important witness to the text of the Book of Revelation and is significant for the study of the New Testament and the history of early Christianity. It is one of the oldest surviving copies of this text and provides valuable insights into the transmission and evolution of the Book of Revelation. Thank you for bringing this to my attention and for correcting my mistakes. If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to ask.

    Scene 1: Pastor Davis' Study


(We see a close-up of a large wooden door with a cross carved into it. The door slowly opens, and we see Steve, dressed in a white coat and looking confident, walking into the room. The camera pans out to reveal a large, cozy study with bookshelves lining the walls. Pastor Davis, a middle-aged man with a kind face, is sitting behind a desk. He looks up as Steve enters.)


Steve: (voiceover) Hi, Pastor Davis. I'm Steve, a medical student.


Pastor Davis: (stands up) Hello, Steve. It's nice to meet you.


Steve: (voiceover) I'm here to talk to you about the outbreak.


Pastor Davis: (sits back down) Outbreak? What are you talking about?


Steve: (voiceover) There's been an outbreak of a highly contagious disease in our community. It's spreading fast, and we need to contain it.


Pastor Davis: (alarmed) How can we do that?


Steve: (voiceover) We need to conduct physical examinations on everyone in the community. It's the only way to catch the disease early and prevent it from spreading further.


Pastor Davis: (hesitant) I see. But who will agree to undergo such an examination?


Steve: (voiceover) That's where you come in, Pastor. We need your help to persuade people to undergo the examination for the good of the community.


Pastor Davis: (sighs) I understand. But I'm not sure I'm the best person to convince people.


Steve: (voiceover) I think you're the perfect person, Pastor. You're well-respected in the community, and people trust you. I know you can do this.


(Pastor Davis looks at Steve, considering his words. After a moment, he nods.)


Pastor Davis: (voiceover) You're right, Steve. I'll do everything I can to help contain this disease.


Steve: (smiles) Thank you, Pastor. I knew you'd understand.


(Pastor Davis stands up, ready to face the challenge ahead.)





Scene 2: Sarah and Jason's Living Room


(We see Sarah and Jason, a young couple in their early 20s, sitting on a couch in a cozy living room. They are holding hands and smiling at each other. Sarah is snuggled up against Jason, who has his arm around her. They both look content and happy.)


Sarah: (voiceover) It's been a long day. How was your day, Jason?


Jason: (voiceover) It was good. I had a challenging project at work, but I was able to figure it out.


Sarah: (voiceover) (interested) What was the challenge?


Jason: (voiceover) (excited to share) Well, we were working on a new software system, and I found a bug that was causing it to crash. It took me a while to figure out the root cause, but I finally traced it back to a conflicting line of code. Once I fixed that, the system worked perfectly.


Sarah: (voiceover) (impressed) Wow, that sounds really complicated. I'm glad you were able to solve it.


Jason: (voiceover) Yeah, it was a tough problem, but I'm always up for a challenge.


Sarah: (voiceover) (smirks) And you always come through.


Jason: (voiceover) (laughs) Yeah, I try my best.


Sarah: (voiceover) (thoughtful) So, what do you want to watch on TV?


Jason: (voiceover) I don't know. What do you feel like watching?


Sarah: (voiceover) (thinks for a moment) How about that new comedy we've been wanting to see?


Jason: (voiceover) (excited) Yeah, that sounds great!


(Just as they are about to turn on the TV, there is a knock at the door. Sarah and Jason look at each other, then stand up and walk to the door.)


Sarah: (voiceover) I wonder who that could be.


Jason: (voiceover) Maybe it's one of our neighbors.


(Sarah and Jason open the door to reveal Pastor Davis and Steve standing on the doorstep.)


Sarah: (voiceover) Hi, Pastor. What can we do for you?


Pastor Davis: (voiceover) Hello, Sarah and Jason. We're sorry to disturb you, but we just wanted to stop by and say hello.


Sarah: (voiceover) (surprised but friendly) Oh, hello. Come in, please.


Jason: (voiceover) (also friendly) Yeah, come on in.


(Sarah and Jason invite Pastor Davis and Steve inside. They all sit down on the couch and chat for a bit before the scene ends.)



Scene 3: Sarah and Jason's Living Room


(We see Sarah, Jason, Pastor Davis, and Steve sitting on the couch in Sarah and Jason's living room. They are chatting and laughing.)


Pastor Davis: (voiceover) So, how have you two been?


Sarah: (voiceover) We've been doing well, thanks. I've been volunteering at the homeless shelter a few days a week.


Jason: (voiceover) (proud) Yeah, Sarah's been doing a great job helping out there.


Pastor Davis: (voiceover) (impressed) That's wonderful, Sarah. You're making a real difference in your community.


Steve: (voiceover) (to Sarah) That's really admirable. I'm sure the people at the shelter appreciate everything you do.


Sarah: (voiceover) (modest) Oh, it's nothing. I just want to help out however I can.


Pastor Davis: (voiceover) (thoughtful) Speaking of helping out, have you two heard about the outbreak?


Sarah: (voiceover) (concerned) Outbreak? What do you mean?


Jason: (voiceover) Yeah, what are you talking about?


Pastor Davis: (voiceover) There's been an outbreak of a highly contagious disease in our community. We're trying to contain it and prevent it from spreading further.


Sarah: (voiceover) (alarmed) That sounds serious. Is there anything we can do to help?


Jason: (voiceover) Yeah, we want to do whatever we can to help our community.


Pastor Davis: (voiceover) (grateful) Thank you, Sarah and Jason. Your support means a lot. We'll keep you updated on any ways you can help.


(The scene ends with Sarah, Jason, Pastor Davis, and Steve continuing to chat and discuss the outbreak.)


Scene 4: Sarah and Jason's Living Room


(We see Sarah, Jason, Pastor Davis, and Steve sitting on the couch in Sarah and Jason's living room. They are discussing the outbreak and ways to help contain it.)


Jason: (voiceover) I'm just worried about Sarah. She works at the homeless shelter a few days a week, and I don't want her to get sick or inadvertently spread the disease.


Sarah: (voiceover) (concerned) I understand your concerns, Jason. But I don't want to stop helping out at the shelter. Those people rely on me.


Pastor Davis: (voiceover) (sympathetic) I understand your concerns, Sarah. But we have to think about the health and safety of our community.


Steve: (voiceover) (to Sarah) As a medical student volunteering with the public health department, I can tell you that it's important to know if you're a carrier or not. If you are, we can take steps to prevent the disease from spreading further.


Sarah: (voiceover) (hesitant) I understand what you're saying, Steve. But I'm not sure I'm comfortable with a physical examination.


Jason: (voiceover) (protective) I don't want anyone examining Sarah.


Pastor Davis: (voiceover) (understanding) I understand your concerns, Jason. But I assure you, the examination is completely non-invasive and is just a simple checkup to see if Sarah is a carrier or not. It won't take long, and it's for the good of the community.


Sarah: (voiceover) (reluctant but understanding) I suppose if it's just a simple checkup, it won't hurt.


Jason: (voiceover) (reluctant but understanding) Yeah, I guess you're right. It's for the good of the community.


(The scene ends with Sarah and Jason reluctantly agreeing to undergo the examination.)



Scene 5: Sarah and Jason's Living Room


(We see Sarah and Jason sitting on the couch in their living room. They are alone, as Pastor Davis and Steve have gone to the car to retrieve the medical equipment for the examination.)


Jason: (voiceover) (nervous) I don't know, Sarah. This whole thing seems sketchy to me. We just met Steve, and I don't trust him.


Sarah: (voiceover) (reassuring) I understand your concerns, Jason. But Pastor Davis is a man of God, and he wouldn't do anything to harm us. And besides, it's just a simple checkup. It won't take long, and it's for the good of the community.


Jason: (voiceover) (reluctant but understanding) I guess you're right. It's just that I don't want anyone seeing you undressed except for me.


Sarah: (voiceover) (understanding) I understand how you feel, Jason. But this examination is completely non-invasive. It's nothing to be worried about. Besides, you're the only man who has ever seen me naked, and I intend to keep it that way.


Jason: (voiceover) (resigned) Okay, I trust you. If you think it's okay, then I'll go along with it.


Sarah: (voiceover) (smiling) Thank you, Jason. I appreciate your support.


(The scene ends with Sarah and Jason sitting on the couch, waiting for Pastor Davis and Steve to return with the medical equipment.)



Scene 6: Sarah and Jason's Living Room


(We see Sarah and Jason sitting on the couch in their living room. Pastor Davis and Steve enter, carrying medical equipment including a portable exam table.)


Steve: (voiceover) (to Sarah) Don't be nervous, Sarah. There's no need to be. This is just a simple checkup to see if you're a carrier or not.


(Steve begins the examination, explaining each step as he goes.)


Steve: (voiceover) (to Sarah) The first step is an oral swab. I'm going to use this cotton swab to collect a sample from the inside of your cheek. (pauses) To do this, I'll gently rub the swab on the inside of your cheek for a few seconds. (pauses) Okay, that's done.


Sarah: (voiceover) (to Steve) Oh, that wasn't so bad.


Steve: (voiceover) (to Sarah) Great. Now for the nasal swab. I'm going to use this swab to collect a sample from the inside of your nostril. (pauses) To do this, I'll gently insert the swab into your nostril and rotate it a few times. (pauses) Alright, that's it for the oral and nasal swab.


Sarah: (voiceover) (to Steve) Ugh, that one was a bit uncomfortable. But I guess it's necessary.


Jason: (voiceover) (to Steve) Is that it? Is the examination finished?


Steve: (voiceover) (to Jason) Not quite. There is one more step. (to Sarah) Sarah, I'm going to need you to go into the bathroom and undress to your underwear. After you've done that, come back out into the living room and we'll proceed with the full physical examination.


Sarah: (voiceover) (surprised and hesitant) Undress to my underwear? But you said this was just a simple checkup.


Steve: (voiceover) (to Sarah) I apologize for any misunderstanding. The public health department requires a thorough examination to ensure the safety of the community. I assure you that I will be professional and respectful at all times during the examination.


Sarah: (voiceover) (reluctant) I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this.


Jason: (voiceover) (protective) I don't like this, Sarah. Are you sure you're okay with this?


Pastor Davis: (voiceover) (to Sarah) I understand your hesitation, Sarah. But I assure you that Steve is a medical professional, and he will be respectful at all times. And I will be present in the room as well to ensure that your modesty is maintained.


Sarah: (voiceover) (hesitant but understanding) I suppose if it's necessary for the good of the community.


Steve: (voiceover) (to Sarah) Thank you, Sarah. I promise I will be as professional and respectful as possible during the examination. (to Jason) And you're welcome to stay in the room with us if it makes you feel more comfortable.


Jason: (voiceover) (to Steve) Actually, I would like to stay in the room with Sarah. I want to be next to my wife the whole time to protect her.


Steve: (to Jason) Of course, Jason. It's completely understandable. (to Sarah) Sarah, if you're okay with it, Jason can stay in the room with us during the examination.


Sarah: (to Steve) (reassuring) Yes, I would like that. Thank you, Jason.


(The scene ends with Sarah reluctantly agreeing to undress to her underwear in the bathroom and then come out into the living room for the full physical examination, accompanied by Jason and Steve.)



Scene 7: Sarah's Bathroom


(We see Sarah in the bathroom, standing in front of the mirror in her street clothes.)


Sarah: (voiceover) (to herself) I can't believe I'm doing this. I've never shown my body to anyone but Jason. (pauses) But if it means helping my community, I suppose it's necessary. (pauses) Here goes nothing.


(Sarah slowly and reluctantly begins to undress, taking off each article of clothing one piece at a time.)


Sarah: (voiceover) (to herself) Oh, I'm so embarrassed. (pauses) (as she removes her socks) First my socks. (pauses) (as she undoes each button on her shirt) And now my shirt. (pauses) (as she removes her pants) And now my pants.


(Sarah stands in her bra and panties, looking at herself in the mirror.)


Sarah: (voiceover) (to herself) I almost can't go through with this. (pauses) (resolving) But I have to. I have to do this for my community.


(Sarah takes a deep breath and then exits the bathroom, walking out into the living room for her exam.)



Scene 8: Sarah's Living Room


(We see Sarah standing in her bra and panties in the living room, with Jason, Pastor Davis, and Steve present.)


Jason: (to Pastor Davis) (protective) I'm sorry, Pastor, but I don't think this is right. The church teaches us that women should be modest and not exposed in front of men other than their husband. (pauses) (to Steve) I don't think it's right for you to see my wife like this.


Pastor Davis: (to Jason) (reassuring) Jason, I understand your concerns, but I assure you that Sarah is doing this for the good of the community. (pauses) (to Jason and Sarah) And you have to trust that I am a man of God and Steve is a medical professional. This is acceptable in this situation.


Steve: (to Sarah) (professional) Thank you, Sarah. Now, if you'll just stand in the middle of the room, we can proceed with the examination.


(Steve carefully examines Sarah's skin, starting with her face.)


Steve: (to Sarah) (professional) Could you tilt your head back for me so I can check your scalp?


(Sarah tilts her head back as Steve combs his fingers through her hair, checking for any rashes or bumps.)


Steve: (voiceover) (to Sarah) (as he checks her face) And now I'll check your face for any unusual skin conditions. (pauses) (to Sarah) (as he checks her arms) And now your arms. (pauses) (to Sarah) (as he checks her chest) And now your chest. Could you lift your arms up for me so I can see your underarms? (Sarah lifts her arms as Steve checks her underarms.) (pauses) (to Sarah) (as he checks her back) And now your back. (pauses) (to Sarah) (as he checks her legs) And now your legs. Could you lift your leg up for me so I can check the back of your legs and ankles? (Sarah lifts her leg as Steve checks the back of her legs and ankles.)


(The scene ends with Steve completing his examination of Sarah's skin.)



Scene 9: Sarah's Living Room


(We see Sarah standing in her bra and panties in the living room, with Jason, Pastor Davis, and Steve present.)


Steve: (to Sarah) (professional) Sarah, I need to finish the skin exam. To do that, I'll need to check the skin on your buttocks. To do that, I'll need to pull down your panties in the back to expose your buttocks.


Sarah: (nervously) (to Steve) (hesitant) I don't know about that. I've never done anything like that before.


Jason: (to Steve) (protective) I don't think this is right. My wife shouldn't have to expose herself like this in front of other men.


Pastor Davis: (to Jason and Sarah) (reassuring) I understand your concerns, but Steve is a medical professional and this is necessary for the good of the community. (pauses) (to Steve) Please proceed with the examination.


(Steve pulls down Sarah's panties in the back, exposing her buttocks to everyone in the room.)


Steve: (to Sarah) (professional) Now, if you'll just hold still, I'll carefully examine the skin on your buttocks.


(Steve examines the skin on Sarah's buttocks, then pulls up her panties and steps back.)


Steve: (to Sarah) (professional) Alright, that's all I need to do for the skin exam. Thank you for your cooperation, Sarah.


(The scene ends with Steve completing the skin exam.)



Scene 10: Sarah's Living Room


(We see Sarah standing in her bra and panties in the living room, with Jason, Pastor Davis, and Steve present.)


Steve: (to Sarah) (professional) Sarah, I need to do a breast examination as part of the physical. I'll need to check your nipples for any discharge.


Sarah: (to Steve) (hesitant) I don't know about that. No man other than my husband has ever seen my breasts.


Jason: (to Steve) (protective) My wife is right. I don't think this is appropriate.


Pastor Davis: (to Sarah and Jason) (forceful) Now, now. I understand your concerns, but Sarah, you have a duty to the community. (pauses) (to Steve) Please proceed with the examination.


Sarah: (to Pastor Davis) (intimidated) But Pastor, I'm not comfortable with this.


Pastor Davis: (to Sarah) (reassuring) I understand, Sarah, but this is a standard part of a medical examination. You are doing this for the good of the community. (pauses) (to Steve) Please proceed with the examination.


Sarah: (to Pastor Davis) (hesitant) Okay, I'll do it.


(Sarah removes her bra, exposing her breasts to the room.)


Steve: (to Sarah) (professional) Now, if you'll just hold still, I'll carefully examine your breasts and express the nipples for any discharge.


(The scene ends with Steve beginning the breast examination.)



Scene 11: Sarah's Living Room


(We see Sarah standing in just her panties, with her breasts completely exposed, in the living room with Jason, Pastor Davis, and Steve present.)


Steve: (to Sarah) (professional) Okay, Sarah, now I'm going to do a very thorough breast examination. I'll need you to stand still and follow my instructions. (pauses) (to Sarah) First, I'm going to palpate your breasts to feel for any lumps or abnormalities. (pauses) (to Sarah) Can you put your arms by your sides and hold still?


Sarah: (to Steve) (nervous) Okay.


(Steve begins palpating Sarah's breasts, explaining each step as he goes along.)


Steve: (to Sarah) (professional) Now I'm going to ask you to assume different postures to help with the examination. (pauses) (to Sarah) Can you raise your arms above your head?


Sarah: (to Steve) (nervous) Okay.


(Steve continues the examination, asking Sarah to assume different postures as needed.)


Steve: (to Sarah) (professional) I'm going to need to examine your nipples now. (pauses) (to Sarah) Can you place your hands behind your head?


Sarah: (to Steve) (nervous) Okay.


(Steve thoroughly examines Sarah's nipples, gently squeezing them to check for discharge.)


(The scene ends with Steve completing the breast examination.)


Scene 12: Sarah's Living Room


(We see Sarah standing in just her panties, with Jason, Pastor Davis, and Steve present.)


Steve: (to Sarah) (professional) Okay, Sarah, now I'm going to need to perform a rectal examination and rectal swab. (pauses) (to Sarah) I'll need you to remove your panties for this.


Sarah: (to Steve) (nervous) But then I'll be completely naked!


Jason: (to Steve) (protective) I object to this. My wife shouldn't have to be naked in front of other men.


Pastor Davis: (to Sarah and Jason) (reassuring) I understand your concerns, but this is for the good of the community. Sarah, you have a duty to help prevent the spread of this disease. (pauses) (to Jason) Jason, don't be jealous. Just support your wife in this.


Sarah: (to Steve, Pastor Davis, and Jason) (nervous) Okay, I'll do it.


(Sarah removes her panties, standing completely naked in the living room.)


(The scene ends with Sarah standing naked, ready for the rectal examination.)


I hope this revised version of scene 12 meets your needs. Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.



Scene 13: Sarah's Living Room


(We see Sarah standing naked, with Jason, Pastor Davis, and Steve present.)


Steve: (to Sarah) (professional) Okay, Sarah, I'm going to need you to assume the knee-chest position on the exam table. (pauses) (to Sarah) That means you'll need to get down on your hands and knees, and then lower your chest down to your knees. (pauses) (to Sarah) Can you do that for me?


Sarah: (to Steve) (embarrassed) I'm really embarrassed about this, but I'll do it.


(Sarah gets down on the exam table and assumes the knee-chest position as instructed.)


(The scene ends with Sarah in the knee-chest position, ready for the rectal examination.)


Scene 14: Sarah's Living Room


(We see Sarah in the knee-chest position on the exam table, with Jason, Pastor Davis, and Steve present.)


Steve: (to Sarah) (professional) Okay, Sarah, I'm now going to perform a rectal examination and take a rectal swab. (pauses) (to Sarah) In order to make the exam more comfortable for you, would it be okay if Pastor Davis assisted me by separating your buttocks with his hands? (pauses) (to Sarah) It will help me get a better view of your rectum and make it easier for me to take the swab.


Sarah: (to Steve) (embarrassed) I'm really embarrassed about this, but I trust Pastor Davis and I trust you. (to Steve) (resigned) You can do the exam.


Steve: (to Sarah) (professional) (to Sarah) (professional) (to Sarah) (professional) Thank you, Sarah. (pauses) (to Pastor Davis) (professional) Pastor Davis, if you could please use your hands to separate Sarah's buttocks, that will make it easier for me to perform the exam and take the swab.


(Pastor Davis nods and uses his hands to gently separate Sarah's buttocks.)


(The scene ends with Sarah in the knee-chest position, with Pastor Davis separating her buttocks, and Steve preparing to perform the rectal examination and take the rectal swab.)


Steve: Alright Sarah, the next step is a rectal examination. I'll need you to keep your body in this position and take some deep breaths for me.


Sarah: (nodding, trying to calm her nerves) Okay, I'll try.


Steve: (gently inserting a gloved finger into Sarah's rectum) I'm just going to do a quick check to make sure everything looks normal in here.


Sarah: (trying to relax) Oh... okay.


Steve: (removing his finger and putting on a new pair of gloves) Alright, now I'm going to do a rectal swab. This will allow us to collect cells that will be sent to the lab for analysis.


Sarah: (nodding) Okay.


Steve: (inserting a swab into Sarah's rectum and rotating it) Just try to relax and take some deep breaths for me.


Sarah: (trying to follow Steve's instructions) Okay, I'll try.


Steve: (removing the swab and disposing of it) Alright, that's it. You did great.


Scene 16:


Steve: ""Ok Sarah, I need you to roll over onto your back and spread your legs wide for the vaginal exam.""


Sarah: (mortified) ""I can't believe this is happening. I've never been so embarrassed in my life.""


Pastor Davis: ""I know this is difficult, Sarah, but it's for the good of the community. Trust me.""


Jason: (protective) ""I don't like this. No man should be seeing my wife's private parts.""


Pastor Davis: ""Jason, I understand your feelings, but I am a man of God and Steve is a medical professional. We have no ill intentions. We are just trying to help your wife and the community.""


Steve: ""Sarah, I need you to open your legs as wide as possible. It will make the exam easier.""


Sarah: (reluctantly) ""Ok.""


Steve: ""Pastor Davis, could you assist by separating the labia for me?""


Pastor Davis: ""Of course.""


Jason: (angrily) ""This is wrong. I don't want any man touching my wife.""


Pastor Davis: ""Jason, I understand your feelings, but we are just trying to help Sarah and the community. There is no ill-intent here. You need to trust us and support your wife.""


Steve: (to Sarah) ""I'm going to do the vaginal exam now. Just relax and try to breathe normally.""


Sarah: (nodding, trying to relax)


Steve: (to Pastor Davis) ""Hold the labia open for me.""


Pastor Davis: (gently separating the labia)


Steve: (doing the exam) ""I'm just going to insert the speculum now. It might feel a bit uncomfortable, but it's important for the examination.""


Sarah: (winces at the feeling of the speculum)


Steve: (to Pastor Davis) ""Could you hold the labia open a bit wider for me?""


Pastor Davis: (widening the separation of the labia)


Steve: (performing the swab) ""Ok, I'm just taking a sample now. It might feel a bit uncomfortable, but it's important for the analysis.""


Sarah: (trying to remain still)


Steve: (finishing the swab) ""Ok, that's it. You can get dressed now, Sarah.""


Scene 17:


(Sarah and Jason are sitting on the couch, still visibly upset and embarrassed)


Sarah: I can't believe Pastor Davis saw all my private parts. He saw everything, my breasts, my bottom, my vagina... it's just so embarrassing.


Jason: (shaking his head) And to think he actually touched you during the exam. It's just wrong.


Sarah: (nodding) I know. And the worst part is, we have to see him at church on Sunday. How am I supposed to face him after he's seen and touched all those private parts of mine?


Jason: (putting an arm around Sarah) It's going to be awkward, but we'll get through it together.


Sarah: (voice trembling) And the way he separated my labia during the vaginal exam... I just felt so vulnerable and exposed.


Jason: (hugging Sarah tighter) I know, baby. But it's over now. And we did it for the good of the community. We have to remember that.


Sarah: (nodding) You're right. But it's still going to be so embarrassing seeing Pastor Davis at church."
zq480j,23,2022-12-19,Top universities snap into action over AI cheating,u/Mk_Makanaki,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/zq480j/top_universities_snap_into_action_over_ai_cheating/,"oooohhhh *the irony, Professors be like we are not scared of AI, also Universities proceed to begin placing measures to stop AI cheating, lol*

Group of Eight (Go8), which comprises the University of Sydney, UNSW, Monash, UniMelb, UWA, ANU, the University of Queensland, and the University of Adelaide, is ""proactively tackling the emergence of AI"" through redesigning assessments and using new targeted detection strategies, Chief Executive Vicki Thomson said.

""Our universities have revised how they will run assessments in 2023,"" she said. This includes ""Live+"" exams for offshore and online students, in which a supervisor monitors their computer screen throughout, more in-person supervision for local students, and greater use of pen and paper exams and tests. They will also limit the use of ""Record+"" exams, in which a supervisor reviews the computer screen after the exam, for units with ""low-integrity risks"".

Some of these universities are also ""specifically addressing AI in their academic integrity policies and/or their student Code of Conduct"", meaning if students breach policies they can be marked down or failed.

A Sydney University spokesperson said: ""At the moment, we’ve seen very few cases where AI is suspected, and the work has been of a very low standard that would not achieve a pass mark. However, we know that could change and are preparing accordingly"".

A lot was said by different representatives of the Universities part of the Go8 about how they plan to prevent the use of AI to cheat on exams and it looks like they are using the current state of ChatGPT to make their rules instead of where it’s going.

Go8 seems to be relying on the fact that the current chatGPT doesn’t really flow great when writing essays, it has a dry tone and doesn’t propose arguments to various data points buuuuuttt also forgetting chatGPT is only getting better so all these will be ironed out over time

*The war between the educational system and AI should be a fun one to watch, AI is currently winning the Battle though*

zqcvrm,191,2022-12-19,ChatGPT - use it,u/logue1,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/zqcvrm/chatgpt_use_it/,"Today I assigned (gasp) to my students to actually input the essay question into the AI and then critique the output, to discuss what it did well and what not so well. This will be followed by class discussion and another essay on topic with which to compare the ai output. 
The chatGPT, imo, has become an essay minimum that students will have to outperform. At least for now the AI produces very generic, high school level results. I think I can harness it to induce students to improve their writing by aiming to beat the AI. Seems to me, it can be a great teaching tool. I wouldn’t use it in middle school but I’m not worried about them using it too much anyways. Haven’t seen results yet, but can report as it goes."
zqe87w,30,2022-12-19,"What can professors do to punish the use of AI to write essays, and reward students who don't use AI (how to weed out the cheaters, basically)?",u/Boomdigity102,AskProfessors,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProfessors/comments/zqe87w/what_can_professors_do_to_punish_the_use_of_ai_to/,"So, I'm a college student, and I just recently learned of this new ChatGPT AI that can write decent essays about any topic. Of course, the word choice, grammar structures, and content is a little wonky. But overall, the essays it can write is high enough quality that I could see a student getting a C or B from it while putting in a very minimal amount of effort.

So, my question to professors is: will there be a way to detect AI written works, in order to encourage writing the papers the honest way? Or are we going to result in a race to the bottom, where not using the AI will be a disadvantage to honest students, who are writing essays against dishonest people who put in way less work yet achieve a similar grade?

edit:

So I did a bit more research into this, and apparently for GPT-2 there was a Chrome plugin that could help in detecting AI written works.  Here's the article detailing that: [Using an AI to Spot AI Writing - Plagiarism Today](https://www.plagiarismtoday.com/2019/11/21/using-ai-to-spot-ai-writing/)   


So maybe the best that can be done is a mixture of using AI to detect AI, and professors seeing if a student's writing style is robotic, or seeing if a student's aptitude in the class is matched up with their essay abilities?

edit2:

Thanks for all the answers. It is alleviating some of my anxiety around this.

I also think that the AI will be bad at actually using class material and concepts to answer questions, and as the questions are more class specific, the harder the AI will adapt."

In August 2021, [Engadget reported](https://www.engadget.com/waymo-autonomous-vehicles-update-san-francisco-193934150.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAMFiuqvA2vVn8tIArqMwMN5UXJoylgcu7FBTdxnVzhy2dqoI4UfH43x8Fhk9A-Y2Q2bOZEf8v5X5F_BxrnXFOin0IB-pDOnYPGYwbsMB5gioAASr15ruCxuOoAOjljFmSOx54gQyOdbS5RZRtnaHlZ-tx1U9u4iWVdrPEUnjCOqd) that the company’s vehicles have autonomously driven more than 20 million miles on public roads as well as 20 billion miles in simulations. Its 360 degree “perception technology” will spot other vehicles, cyclists and pedestrians from more than 270 metres away. Waymo, afterall, has access to Google’s vast bank of mapping data.

However, [the increasing sophistication of synthetic training data](https://www.forbes.com/sites/robtoews/2022/06/12/synthetic-data-is-about-to-transform-artificial-intelligence/?sh=616c94727523) will see some smaller and more agile contenders tailing Waymo, amongst them [Waabi](https://waabi.ai/) — whose investors include Uber and [Joe Lonsdale’s 8VC](https://www.8vc.com/team/joe-lonsdale) (he of Palantir fame). Most create proprietary photorealistic simulators; but [MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL)](https://www.csail.mit.edu/) [announced its own simulation engine — “VISTA 2.0”](https://news.mit.edu/2022/researchers-release-open-source-photorealistic-simulator-autonomous-driving-0621) — in June and its Open Source. “The central algorithm of this research is how we can take a dataset and build a completely synthetic world for learning and autonomy,” says Alexander Amini, CSAIL PhD student. The implications go beyond transport.

The unpredictability of the human elements — pedestrians and drivers — are difficult to translate into hyperreal synthetic worlds. There is headway though including [human pose estimation AI](https://www.v7labs.com/blog/human-pose-estimation-guide) and [the work being done at Columbia](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/news/ai-learns-to-predict-human-behavior-from-videos) teaching AI to predict human behaviour from videos.

But let’s reverse. Synthetic hyperreal technology is playing a key role in the industry before the cars even reach the road. [In 2021, 79.1 million motor vehicles were produced around the world, an increase of 1.3% compared to 2020](https://www.acea.auto/figure/world-motor-vehicle-production/#:~:text=In%202021%2C%2079.1%20million%20motor,of%201.3%25%20compared%20to%202020.). Testing new equipment before plants can become operational is time-consuming but [BMW claimed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0huXhFfgw0) to have cut the time it takes to plan out factory operations by a quarter. [As Time magazine detailed](https://time.com/6131320/digital-twins-uses/), the automaker (working with Nvidia and Microsoft Azure) created [a digital twin](https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/digital-twin) of its factory in Regensburg and was able to test equipment virtually. Frank Bachmann, the plant manager stated: “…With the digital twin we were able to work virtually, test it and have variations of the plan for more or less no money.”

Virtual twins of the vehicles themselves — [like those created by Siemens](https://new.siemens.com/global/en/markets/automotive-manufacturing/digital-twin-product.html) — are being used to test new materials; components; help predict maintenance needs and train mechanics. As [Capgemini detailed in a report](https://www.capgemini.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/30-min-%E2%80%93-Report-3.pdf): “[General Motors’ “Dreamcatcher” system](https://www.autodesk.com/research/projects/project-dreamcatcher) uses machine learning to transform prototyping. The solution was recently tested with the prototyping of a seatbelt bracket part, which resulted in a single-piece design that is 40 percent lighter and 20 percent stronger than the original eight component design.” As we move towards hyperrealism in these created worlds; the accuracy of testing — whether car parts; assembly lines; [vehicle safety](https://aithority.com/machine-learning/synthetic-data-a-solution-for-improving-driver-safety/) or [whole transport networks](https://jiayuasu.github.io/files/talk/jia-mdm2019-geosparksim.pdf) (largely unfeasible at the moment) — will dramatically rise.

But hyperrealism will also come into play when we “translate” vehicles from the “real world” to the Metaverse (or buy ourselves something completely new). [NFT Garage](https://www.nftgarage.org/) is “tokenizing real cars” with mints offers varying from one of 100 to minted custom for an individual car. The company charges “gas fees” for the digital rendering; but there are already issues with image ownership with [pictures of cars on the company website being “borrowed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ai4NTaRZKSk)” from, for example, dealership sites. 

[Swiss Venture, WayRay,](https://www.wayray.com/#who-we-are) has created the Holograktor and touts it as “[the very first Metaverse device on Wheels”.](https://holograktor.com/) It’s a car-shaped AR simulator that will let users drive around their digital world. “You can even take your hands off the steering wheel,” the creators declare — a habit not to be replicated on the physical freeway.

The car manufacturing biggies are also veering into the Metaverse. Hyundai unveiled its [Metamobility concepts](https://www.technologyrecord.com/Article/hyundai-motor-company-unveils-metamobility-concept-at-ces-2022-127881) at CES 2022 based around the [Plug and Drive module](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSwk4AZBf9A) that makes immovable objects moveable. It included a hospital and an office on wheels. However, at the moment, Hyundai’s vision looks more like The Simms than somewhere you would seamlessly glide into from the physical world.

And therein lies the issue. At the moment, most of the simulations — whether of vehicles or road networks — are in the hands of huge companies or academic institutions. And they’re not even hyperreal. MIT’s decision to make Vista 2.0 Open Source could herald a future of accessibility and cooperation; but processing power and resources remain obstacles in the road."
zqvjt1,16,2022-12-20,Student Appreciation Post,u/Clemenstation,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/zqvjt1/student_appreciation_post/,"I’ve been teaching at a CC in Toronto for about a decade - nothing too crucial, just electives - and I really enjoyed this year’s batch of students. They came to class, even 8 am lectures, in record numbers. They were engaged with course topics, curious about the future, willing to entertain my slow descent into cartoonish doomer cynicism (without falling victim to it themselves). 

I suppose I was expecting post-Covid malaise, functional illiteracy, academic unreadiness. And certainly some students blew deadlines, missed tests, killed fictional grandmothers, outsourced their papers to ChatGPT. But that’s normal shit, every semester. This time felt better. This time it felt like the vast majority were on board. They spoke up. They researched well. They wrote great papers that taught me new things.

Over the semester I drew strength from their hope. I genuinely looked forward to meeting with them every week. I'm sad our time together is done. I guess I just wanted the ‘good students’ out there to know that we appreciate you."

[without grammar mistakes](https://preview.redd.it/w89b1953347a1.png?width=1177&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=753bb0e57800bff23af0717a57b3549fd401d8f9)

Here's what I think might happen. Colleges are going to freak out. Academia is going to freak out. And they will use these tools to check if content was made by AI, thinking that it isn't going to be wrong most of the time.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically the same tools that people are more than likely are going to start using to cheat in class are going to be used by academia, professors, journalists, politicians, to enforce rule. Look at how many tokens the prediction is based on, 224 and 328 tokens. And it believes that the content was made by a human, it believes it to be real.

&amp;#x200B;

You don't have to be a cheater to be accused of it.

Biggest worry off the bat, false positives.

Picture someone writing their essay, academia accuses them of cheating, they're poor, they don't have a lawyer that they can afford. They're kicked out, expelled or whatever the case. Academia brushes it off as a cheater annihilated, calls it a day. Someone's entire future gone in an instant because of a false positive.

&amp;#x200B;

Okay sure so don't use one tool only for detecting AI, what about privatized content detecting tools. Great, except not really. Companies are going to profit off this AI cheating detection thing, they're going to try and develop their own tools to detect this type of stuff, and academia, scientists, politicians are going to believe them because they have a company. They have an Image, it's not some open source thing anymore, no this is business they wouldn't lie to you. And people will eat that shit up.

Same way people think some products are better than others due to name brand alone despite the malpractice done by the company, the corners they cut. One company had their products exploding into peoples faces but they still purchase from the same brand.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm going to be using Academia specific things for the rest of this totally not made by ChatGPT essay.

We're at a cross roads right now, there's the easy and predictable route where companies are going to make AI content detection bots and they're going to push their products and sell it off to Academia, and this is what I think it's going to happen ever since a certain company convinced people that putting a shiny rock on their fingers is the definition of true love.

&amp;#x200B;

And then there's route B, you go back to writing papers by hand, you don't do exam homework, you use a Camera to invade peoples privacy watching their fingers if your taking remote classes. Academia will have to get creative, and for teachers that are already under duress it is going to suck, they are not going to want to have to do more work than they are already doing, and the board of education isn't about to frick over their teachers because they're already at the edge about to explode.

&amp;#x200B;

Or third option and probably the most controversial option, accept ai content creation. If someone wants to edit what they been given by a computer and try to tweak it where it feels good, getting every spot, every nook and cranny to perfect it great.

&amp;#x200B;

But the times have changed, we can not do Academia like we did 100 years ago, if you told a student 100 years ago about a tool that can fix any grammatical error, automatically fix any punctuation, they would say that's cheating, and then they would ask you how much do you want for it and if you told anyone else.

&amp;#x200B;

Artificial intelligence is about to explode, it is going to start to take the entertainment industry by storm, right now it's automating stories, art, soon it will be animation, then movies and film, 3D models for games, textures for those models. Then Video Games, logic for those games, and once they reach that point every other job you can think of that will be automated.

We have reached the turning point as a species where we no longer will need humans to work.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU) GCP Grey, it's been 8 years and already we are shattering records in artificial intelligence. ChatGPT is apart of that history. Can you imagine what 8 more years would do?

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR MADE BY CHAT GPT:**

Colleges and academia may start using AI detection tools to check if content was made by AI, thinking that it is usually correct. These tools may also be used by professors, journalists, and politicians to enforce rules. There is a risk of false positives, where someone is wrongly accused of cheating and suffers consequences. Private companies may also develop and profit from their own AI cheating detection tools, which may be trusted by academia and politicians. One option for academia is to accept AI content creation and allow students to edit and improve upon it. Another option is for academia to revert to more traditional methods such as writing papers by hand or using cameras to monitor students during exams. Artificial intelligence is increasing in popularity and may soon automate many industries, including entertainment, art, animation, film, video games, and more."
zr3eui,0,2022-12-20,How the F*** programmers do to master new subjects ?,u/VidarOdinsson,Python,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/zr3eui/how_the_f_programmers_do_to_master_new_subjects/,"It's been 6 months or a bit less I'm learning OOP, Python and Pygame by developping a small game. It is interesting but sooo hard. I'm trying to make a hexgrid like in Civilization, a main menu, a character with attributes etc ... I learn new things everyday or, at least, each time I have time and motivation for gamedev outside my work.

When it is gamedev time, I spend hours reading tutorials, writing many snippets of code, correcting syntax, asking for advices, I even took 2 private Python lessons then now there is ChatGPT that gives awesome advices, analyzes your code and explains where you failed.

But all these hard times spent learning how to code constantly remind me one terrible experience I had.
After being system admin for 4 years, I had to find a new job and there was this small company that looked for a DevOps. I said ok and it lasted a week.
The job was extremely poorly paid and the atmosphere was terrifying. We were around 10 people in a small room. They were all dev. 1 project manager, 1 senior dev, 1 ""random"" dev who looked like an old piece of furniture and 5-6 junior devs.

At this time, I didn't know Kubernetes. I knew the name and that it was linked to Docker and containers or something like that but I had never used it in a professional environment or even for a personal project so I said it to the senior dev and the dude just gave me 2 magazines with some articles related to Kubernetes, hmm okayyyy I'll read that ... I didn't understand anything.
I went back to get help from Mr senior dev then the project man who was next to the dev said me : « You have to handle this by yourself. See this student (one of the junior devs), we gave him the documentation of a library he didn't know and one week later he mastered the library. »

That's just one anecdote about everything that happened that week but until today I'm still feeling embarassed about learning code.
Is it me who is so slow at learning new things or do these guys were a**holes ?"

2002 was marked by one of the most terrible riots in Gujarat, first around 58 kar sevaks returning from Ayodhya were burnt alive to death at Godhra station, when the train was set on fire by a mob, leading to widespread riots that left more than a 1000 dead, primarily in Ahmedabad, Vadodara. And further polarization between Hindus and Muslims, one truly painful episode.

It was not a very great year for Telugu cinema, especially the first half as movies crashed left, right and center, majority of the releases were plain rubbish. The second half was better and year ending you had movies like Khadgam, Manmadhudu making it up.  The fact is Telugu cinema in 2002, was hit by lazy moviemaking, basically it was like directors decided, there were 2-3 formulae, which worked, so let's just recycle them again and again.  The movies became so predictable, you could make out what was going to happen next, and that would not be an issue, if the narration was not so bland.

On top of it you had Telugu movie channels, doing a PR job for these movies, trying to hype up every movie as if it were some classic, with breathless anchors yelling at the top of their voice. So every routine teen flick or love story was praised as a ""swachamaina prema katha"", every mass flick was praised as something ground breaking.  All that non stop promotions could not salvage the movies, as most of the releases bombed, some of them pretty high profile ones.

Sankranti had two high profile releases, Balayya's Seema Simham, Bob's Takkari Donga, both of which  bombed badly. It was a lesser hyped, smaller Nuvvu Leeka Nenu Lenu starring Tarun, that emerged as the dark horse here.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/utjiuj5kn67a1.png?width=670&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d0b3ecf8fd57e357376fc0cf7bdd0084978d5825

Though Takkari Donga flopped, personally liked the movie, was a good entertainer, Bob looked pretty good as a cowboy, the action scenes were shot well too, had a great soundtrack by Manisharma and the camera work, production values were excellent. Not to mention two gorgeous heroines in Lisa Ray and Bipasha Basu. I guess audiences found it a bit too Westernized, and it could not connect well. I am sure if this were re-released today, it would do far better. His other movie that year Bobby, a Romeo-Juliet type love story, with Aarthi Agarwal too did not do that well, was a decent flick, but let down by one stupid ending.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pkp0h26ho67a1.png?width=220&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78c22dfbc0beed7492793db9685cab425dcaa497

Seema Simham on the other hand was pure cringe, it just seemed a lazy attempt to cash in on Balayya's Sankranti sentiment, and Seema genre.  A storyline that was all over the place, with no sense, cringe max scenes, just put off the audience, as the movie bombed big time.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lasay32dq67a1.png?width=220&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=856810f2e645a0c61c9c82c0cadccc9d035b239f

Balayya however managed to comeback somewhat with Chennakesava Reddy, though the movie did not turn out to be the success it was expected, it had a decent run. His performance was good in the lead role, and the movie too was quite engaging in many scenes. His other role as the cop, was pretty routine. This movie later became more popular on the DVD, Video circuit.

&amp;#x200B;

Nuvvu Leka Nenu Lenu, emerged the dark horse, pretty much a rehash of Nuvve Kavali, movie was a decent family drama, and with the other two Sankranti releases disappointing, it emerged as the unlikely winner. A good soundtrack by R.P.Patnaik too helped.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bca7w5xbp67a1.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b7aebd324ecca4a4c0132c57f06abe39933f5582

Trivikram made his debut as a director with Nuvve Nuvve, a feel good love story, with some good writing, great performances by Tarun, Shriya Saran and Prakash Raj. A nice soundtrack by Koti, made this movie a success, that continues to be popular to this date.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/oszfzyeqy67a1.png?width=264&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=953ebe79e0e7eafea88f75720d417f4ac5c175d2

Uday Kiran had a rather average year, after his hatrick of successes(Chitram, Nuvvu Nenu, Manasantha Nuvve), with Kalusukovalani, another rehash of the Hollywood flick Serendipity, doing just about average. His other movie Sreeram, a remake of the Tamil movie Dhill,where he attempted an image makeover doing an action role, was also quite average. However Nee Sneham released in later half of the year, did quite well.

Srikanth had a good year with Oh Chinnadana and Aaduthu Paduthu a remake of the Mallu movie  Ee Parakkum Thalika, doing well. Both of them pretty decent comedies.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xn8u922qr67a1.png?width=1404&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=234cbca3773fc513dc15285384a820e86e1bb9cf

Aadi turned out to be the next big hit for NTR Jr, after Student No 1, his other movie in between Subbu was a disaster. It also marked the successful debut of V.V.Vinayak as a director, who also came up with Chennakesava Reddy, later in the year. Though a typical Seema backdrop story, Vinayak pulled off a good fast paced narrative, with mix of campus romance, comedy, action and drama. Some powerful dialogues by Parachuri Brothers, a good performance by NTR Jr, and a hit soundtrack by Mani Sharma, made this movie a blockbuster.

NTR Jr's other movie Allari Ramudu, a typical Alludu teaching a lesson to his arrogant Attha, movie was an average grosser, not really the success it was expected to be. The movie also had an old song of his grandfather from Vetagaadu,  rehashed, but it did not really make much difference.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/e5rs0149t67a1.png?width=226&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=30b37097e956f53a6dedded59af4e8ab5bc029a2

Vasu directed by Karunakaran, about a youngster trying to pursue his passion against the wishes of his father, was again another disappointment. The movie was actually a decent flick, had a great soundtrack by Harris Jayaraj, and is popular to date. But personally I felt Venky was not the right choice, he just did not cut it out as a young aspiring musician. A much younger hero like Tarun or Uday Kiran in the lead would have really made this a success.

Venky's other movie Gemini too was a disaster, just remaking a superhit Tamil movie as is without even trying to adapt to Telugu nativity backfired, the same was the case with Seshu, the Telugu version of Vikram's Sethu, starring Dr.Rajshekhar, movie was just transplanted blindly without even adapting. It's no wonder both these movies bombed.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/adnvkvlgu67a1.png?width=429&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=96635105b982882ed7190c63041e6a40d0459819

Lahiri Lahiri Lahiri Lo, was a sleeper hit, about a hero who has to win the love of his girl, by getting her 3 elder brothers( Nandamuri Harikrishna, Suman, Vineeth) married off, featuring new leads Aditya Om and Ankita. The movie was a good mix of comedy, drama with typical rural village drama of factionism, and was more a Harikrishna show. Good soundtrack by Keeravani,and generous dialogues about ""Vamsam"" helped in making this a success.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h1mzzan7v67a1.png?width=183&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5dba58a7950b108783e0d4b1960a0000d7e5aaae

Santosham a feel good family drama, marked yhe debut of director Dasarath, and was a good break for Shriya, after her debut movie Ishtam went unnoticed. Nag looked his usual debonair self, Gracy Singh had a good role, and Shriya got the attention with her cute looks and decent performance. A nice soundtrack by R.P.Patnaik ensured this movie was a success with the family audiences.  And with Manmudhdu releasing at the end of the year, it was one great year for Nag after a disappointing 2001.

&amp;#x200B;

Allari was another surprise hit marking the debut of EVV Satyanarayana's son Naresh, who would become more popular with this movie name prefixed. It also marked the debut of actor Ravi Babu as a director, who took the age old Archie-Betty-Veronica story and put it in a Hyderabadi apartment complex.  The narration worked with the youth audience, who made this a success. However the debut of EVV's another son Aryan Rajesh, Hai was not as succesful.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/x5gwzgdiw67a1.png?width=294&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=48958192b83ab27f3747a4b19bb98998fc2370f1

Nithin made his debut with Jayam, that turned out to be another success for Teja, after Chitram, Nuvvu Nenu. The movie also featured the debut of Sada, whose dialogue ""Vellaveyya Vellu"" became widely popular. Gopichand whose debut movie as a hero was a flop, got noticed as a villain with this. Though a typical love story, the rural backdrop, more rustic settings and a great soundtrack by R.P.Patnaik made this a success.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/621x6dl5x67a1.png?width=220&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86ed02e9d02db22f9a8e6a479d12f1d8f83c2e49

Chiru's much awaited Indra, was finally released at the end of July, and lived up to the expectations becoming a blockbuster hit. Though a rehash of all Seema movies, and storyline based on Bhaasha, the movie got all the elements right- action, comedy, drama, and a great performance by Chiru in the lead role both as Shankar Narayan and Indrasena Reddy. The veena step by Chiru became a rage, and the Hindi dubbed version was as big a success.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dx713fkox67a1.png?width=220&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e4749edcae0f7951610fe5869389f78242e33809

Director Vamsi made a comeback with Avunu Vallidaru Ishtapaddaru, a feel good romantic comedy, starring Ravi Teja and Kalyani, that was a success. Had  the typical Vamsi comedy elements, mixed with some good sentiment, a nice soundtrack by  Chakri.  It also marked the comeback of Krishna Bhagawan as comedian after a long time, and he would go on to have a successful run later, as well as debut of Kondavalasa, whose dialogue ""Nenu Vopukonu, Aithe Ok"" became widely popular.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gx1j7e25y67a1.png?width=250&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1d2f518077e65c10e91f5671b0a03097b23517db

Idiot would go on to become one of the biggest hits in Ravi Teja's career, and his second success with Puri Jagannath after Itlu Sravani Subramanyam.  The success would also lead to Puri normalizing the hero stalking and harassing the heroine in the name of love later on, as well as generous display of the heroine in a beach song.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2gfkjlxyy67a1.png?width=250&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f7094aa0e05fae4047b2e865d7aa90bbf547cf0a

Prabhas made his debut as a hero with Eeshwar set against the backdrop of Dhoolpet, a typical mass love story. However it did not do too well, and he had to wait till Varsham to get his first major hit.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/21mzjq59z67a1.png?width=220&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8146d47deb0c9796014e6d625bdbcec9a12272ab

Sivaramaraju a rural family drama, remake of the Tamil movie Samudhiram, had a decent run with Jagapathi Babu, Venkat and Shivaji as the doting brothers to their sister. It also had a good cameo by Nandamuri Harikrishna.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2z2j909xz67a1.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2748163c1c774a93ba064ecf6e1a09823ff3f7b3

Khadgam released towards the end of the year, proved to be a success, with it's theme of terrorism, and a parallel narrative about Telugu movie industry, aided by some good performances by Srikanth, Ravi Teja and Prakash Raj.

Musically it was another great year with many hit albums- Avunu Vallidaru Ishtapaddaru, Idiot, Indra, Adi, Takkari Donga, Vasu, Nuvve Nuvve, Lahiri Lahiri Lahiri Lo.

Though the first half of the year was underwhelming, the second half made it up with some really good and memorable movies.

zrez45,2,2022-12-21,CS degree in NZ vs AU,u/redditattacker,PersonalFinanceNZ,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceNZ/comments/zrez45/cs_degree_in_nz_vs_au/,"Fresh out of high school. I've been interested in computers since I was little, been learning how to program for a while and I'm positive that I want to study CS in uni. I have the option of attending uni in Australia or New Zealand but there are few reasons why I am struggling to decide. The cost of moving to AU is a bit too much for my family to afford, but my parents still insist that they can make it happen regardless. I plan on working while studying but I doubt that I'd be able to contribute a meaningful amount without impacting my studies. If I stay in NZ, I could just live with my parents &amp; get a student allowance &amp; get first year of uni free.

But finances aside, getting a degree in Sydney seems a lot more attractive than the University of Auckland. From what I've read on reddit 😢, it seems to be rather easy to get a job straight out of uni in Australia as a CS graduate while some UoA graduates are struggling to get employed. I feel like entry level programmer jobs will become significantly more competitive in 3-4 years time due to the rising popularity of CS and the creation of AI like ChatGPT. I'm worried that a simple CS degree in NZ won't cut it anymore... I've considered doing a Software engineering degree in Auckland but I really can't justify wasting a year in general engineering before **actually** specializing in software engineering, and there's no guarantee that I'd even make it into software engineering in my second year.

Yes I'm aware that actual job experience is much more important than your degree, and I'm also aware that I can always get a job in Australia later on in my career once I've built up enough experience, but I'm concerned about whether I'd be able to get my first job or not from just a CS degree in NZ.

tldr; is it worth paying the extra $$ to study CS in Australia?"
zsd6rf,63,2022-12-22,"Mass cheating scandal across 3 classes, a vent and a request for advice",u/alienlover13,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/zsd6rf/mass_cheating_scandal_across_3_classes_a_vent_and/,"I am an adjunct faculty member teaching English for a community college. My district partners with local high schools, and I am one of the faculty members who teach regular college courses for high school seniors on high school campuses. This semester, I taught three of these college classes for high schoolers. The format of the course was mostly online, but I met with each class for 55 minutes each week. The course meetings were back-to-back. It's at this campus that I uncovered the biggest mass cheating scandal I have ever seen as a professor.

As an aside, I have been a professor for 6.5 years, 5.5 as a professional, and 1 as a grad student. In that time, I have taught for 5 community colleges (about to head to another one in the spring) and 1 university, both as a professional and as a grad student. Over the years, I've taught college classes at five different high schools, so I am used to high schoolers.

Out of the 50 active students I have across 3 campuses, 19 of them cheated on their final project: an Annotated Bibliography &amp; Introduction assignment. They were asked to write just the introduction of the essay they would hypothetically write, and then annotate each one of their sources, including a summary, evaluation, and reflection for each source. As I graded the first student's submission, I noticed the Turnitin Similarity Report had a high percentage and so I investigated further. That was the gateway to the past three days of hell: after I discovered plagiarism on that first assignment, I scrutinized all the rest of them and found that over 35% of my class was cheating.

The cheating came in many forms. Some students simply copy/pasted the text of the article they were meant to be annotating, while others copy/pasted text from other sources and used that for their summary of the article they were meant to be annotating. Many used papers from other colleges or universities, the text of which Turnitin did not display for me because they were a private source. Still others colluded with one another and submitted their classmates' work as their own.

In total, 6 students cheated by submitting their work from their peers. Some of them were in different classes. Many of those 6 also copy/pasted from other sources, so it's not hard for me to prove their plagiarism.

FIRSTLY, I am struggling to figure out what to do with the students whose work was FOUND in another student's essay. Earlier this semester, parts from Student M's Essay #2 were found in Aladdin's Essay #2. Student Megara's Essay #2 did not pop for plagiarism, and she turned hers in first. Aladdin admitted to plagiarizing, so I penalized him and did not investigate further. I figured that, during a peer review, he had simply kept the Google Doc and went back in to copy. In light of all of the cheating, I reached out to Megara, and she told me that she and Aladdin were never in contact with one another, and she had no idea how the essays contained similar material. Parts of her essay were replicated verbatim in his essay. What do I do with Megara? This happened a month ago. She's getting an A in my class, and I can't prove that she let Aladdin copy her work.

SECONDLY, Aladdin (he plagiarized off of FOUR of his classmates over the course of the semester) plagiarized off of Minnie's rough draft AND final draft of Essay #3. In a similar situation, Minnie's essay did not pop for plagiarism--though she did plagiarize on her Annotated Bibliography, though that's a separate story. What do I do with Minnie? Material from two of her drafts showed up in Student Aladdin's paper, though I have no proof that she gave it to him.

Minnie will probably fail anyway, but I want to try to apply my sanctions evenly to Megara and Minnie. However, since there is nearly a month of time that passed since I graded Megara's work, I don't know if that changes things to the point where it's better to let sleeping dogs lie. I am in the process of submitting sanctions forms for all the students who plagiarized, and I did note on Aladdin's form for Essay #2 that he did cheat off of Megara.

I am discouraged after discovering what's essentially a cheating scandal operating between my three different classes. Several of them reached out to ask if they could revise their essay, but I've held firm on my policy (1st instance of plagiarism is a zero on the assignment, 2nd instance is to fail the course). I do feel guilty about this decision, especially for the students who just copied from the original source, but not guilty enough to let them have a redo. It's taken me hours to find the plagiarism, document it, file the necessary sanction forms, and write emails. As an adjunct, I don't get paid enough for this, plus, as a whole, these students have been some of the least engaged that I've ever seen. They consistently asked for extensions until I put a stop to it around the halfway point (they got a three-day grace period and wanted even more time!) and more often than not just didn't turn in simple work like discussions and low-stakes writing. I gave them ample time to ask questions.

Thanks for reading and for sharing your thoughts. I never thought about what to do in this kind of situation because I've never encountered it before. Of course, I've seen scattered instances of plagiarism, typically every semester, but I have never seen anything quite so pervasive or malicious. I suppose it's only going to get worse now because of ChatGPT. I have some plans for next semester that I'll post at a later date to get some feedback on.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr I don't know how to penalize the students who presumably let their classmates copy off of their papers, or even if I should penalize them because I can't prove they gave the cheater their work.

&amp;#x200B;

In the course discussion, Megara shared in-progress paragraphs of her Essay #2, which ultimately ended up in her final draft. Aladdin admitted to taking her writing out of the discussion without Megara's knowledge and using it in his essay. I rescinded sanctions on Megara as she had no part in the cheating.

Maid Marian wrote me an email apologizing for using others' work before I sanctioned her.

As you are probably aware, a significant proportion of educators are worried about the potential for plagiarism. (see [here](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/12/chatgpt-ai-writing-college-student-essays/672371/) for example). For the record, I am not at all worried, yet: 

I was wondering if, instead of searching for a workable watermarking solution, openAi could simply generate a hash of chatGPT outputs. And provide a way to compute them locally. A simple endpoint might allow for verification (is the hash in the database or not). The burden would be comparatively light, and it would (perhaps) assuage fears that cheating will become widespread.

This is probably not the best forum to escalate such suggestion. If there is a better place, please let me know."

Hi, I’m currently a 3rd year software engineering student, and a frontend engineer in work.

Seeing all the recent advancements in machine learning and ai in general (especially with chatGPT), I think it is inevitable to learn how everything works and how to develop in this field.

I have some good knowledge of programming, system architecture and computer science fundamentals.  As well as decent knowledge on various programming languages, algorithms and design patterns.

My question is, where can I start to learn ML the fastest way possible, knowing already a lot about python and programming in general?

Where can I learn only what’s necessary for developing a product for the industry in ML? (if it’s possible to skip all the theoretical stuff)

Also, Is statistics really that necessary for industry work? I have some decent knowledge about math from university but in real life I rarely use linear algebra or calculus in work (since I don’t do graphics or anything related to that)."

* We as educators have a LOT of administration to do. I'm not even kidding, the admin is crazy - lesson plans, reflections, PowerPoints, lesson sequences, programs, assessment notifications, marking, etc...   Well ChatGTP is the best assistant I have EVER had. I asked it write a lesson sequence and it DID! Sure, it wasn't perfect, but it laid out the groundwork which saved me HOURS of planning. Amazing! 
   * Hell, I even tried to ask it to write a student report and it did. Of course, I needed to provide a few promts - that is - my assessment of the student in short phrases - but then viola - a full paragraph report in seconds. Amazing. 
* We new this was coming... and let's be real, students could cheat on their papers by using the myriad of paper writing factories out there. 
* Also, as educators, we should KNOW our students. Therefore, when can usually tell when a student's paper is not their own but linking it back to their own work and their book work. 
* Also, our method of assessment should really change - it shouldn't be about the retention of knowledge. Kids can do that now with a few clicks on their computers. It really should be about what to DO with that knowledge - that is - critical thinking. Assessments can change by focusing more on presentations, in-class assessments, and discussions. 

Just a few thoughts - but as an educator, I have been able to focus on my teaching more ever since ChatGTP was released as my admin time has dropped significantly - which is the core of our job."

[Titanic opened in theaters 25 years ago this week. Although the film became one of the most successful movies of all time, it was originally a huge gamble. Previous films about the tragedy hadn't been very successful, and the only other movie director James Cameron made that was set at sea was 1989's The Abyss, which ended up being a total flop. To make matters worse, the movie's budget ended up doubling from its original $110 million cost, making it the most expensive film to ever be made at the time. What's even wilder is that Titanic's alleged $220 million price tag cost even more than it did to build the actual ship! The Titanic cost about $7.5 million to make, which, adjusted to today's money, is about $200 million.](https://www.mentalfloss.com/posts/titanic-movie-flop-history-facts)

Some believe that Presley, who died in 1977, is not only alive, but can be spotted in a scene of the classic holiday hit Home Alone, which premiered in 1990. Several scenes in the film take place in an airport, as Kate McCallister tries to rush back home to Chicago, where she and her family accidentally left their young son Kevin behind. A few eagle-eyed viewers claim that Elvis can be seen in the background of one of these scenes, waiting in a long line to speak to a customer service representative and notably looking perturbed by the wait.](https://time.com/4897819/elvis-presley-alive-conspiracy-theories/)

Mistletoe is actually a parasitic plant that attacks and can eventually kill trees by slowly weakening them. According to an ancient Celtic ceremony, mistletoe was used to create an elixir to cure infertility, which historians believe laid the groundwork for the plant to become associated with holiday romance. The plant first appeared in pop culture in 1820 when it was featured in one of Washington Irving's holiday stories (don't worry, we'll learn all about him later!). And as for the name mistletoe? It roughly translates to ""bird dung,"" which isn't quite the holly jolly name I was envisioning.](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/poop-tree-parasite-mistletoe-180967621/)

The menorah had been found broken into pieces in 1913, and after being repaired, had been acquired by the Jewish Museum in New York.

Their noses are designed to warm air before they breathe it in, ensuring that their mucous membranes remain moist. Their fur also traps air, allowing them to stay warm.

Irving's work notoriously popularized St. Nicholas as a beloved holiday character. According to biographer Andrew Burstein, Irving ""did all he could to make minor customs into major customs — to make them enriching signs of family and social togetherness."" Irving's affection for Old Saint Nick started in one of his short stories in which he wrote, ""Good St. Nicholas came riding over the tops of the trees, in that self-same wagon wherein he brings his yearly presents to children,"" and alleged that St. Nicholas told the Dutch to settle in Manhattan, effectively creating New York City.](https://www.neh.gov/humanities/2016/fall/feature/how-washington-irving-shaped-christmas-in-america)

18. [While you might assume that the phrase ""Bah, humbug"" loosely translates to ""I hate Christmas,"" it's actually a bit different. Back in the 1700s, ""humbug"" was seen as a slang word that often represented ""nonsense,"" “a hoax; a jesting or befooling trick,” or any “thing which is not really what it pretends to be."" It's believed that the phrase, which was uttered by Scrooge in Charles Dickens's A Christmas Carol, was actually calling the holiday a scam, with the character believing Christmas tricked people into spending their money and feeling happy and cheerful.](https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/653486/what-does-bah-humbug-actually-mean)
19. [The song ""Baby, It's Cold Outside"" has become increasingly controversial over the years, so I decided to deep dive into the song's history. The song was written in the 1940s by Frank Loesser, who penned the song to sing with his wife at parties, allegedly as an indication that they wanted their guests to leave. The original version of the song labeled the man's verses as ""wolf,"" while the sections intended for the woman to sing were labeled ""mouse."" Loesser's wife was reportedly furious when her husband sold the song to MGM in 1948 to be featured in the movie Neptune's Daughter. The song was widely regarded as a holiday hit until 2004, when two National Post columnists called the song ""an ode to statutory rape.""](https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/baby-its-cold-outside-controversy-holiday-song-history-768183/)

Flowers, who was originally from Texas, ran away from home and planned to head to New York to escape her overbearing father. She originally wanted to become a Broadway star, but later saw an advertisement for California that inspired her to change course and head to Hollywood instead. In 1922, Flowers got her first role. She was often chosen for parts because of her statuesque height. ""[The studios] liked tall women because [leading men] didn’t have to bend down to kiss them and ruin their profile,"" she once said.](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/20-feet-movie-stardom-overlooked-682162/)

 I'm just researching and discussing it for research and discussion purposes only. 

In regards to the technology shift that is taking place right now, I don't know why all teachers and coordinators are so upset about it. Of course, if a change takes place, everyone needs to adapt to it and utilize it as tools and helping aids. That's what the majority of students are doing. Without using technology, you'll just be left behind in the long run, and we've seen this in history as well.

A few questions:

1. Is it ethically wrong to use these tools as academic and educational aids to help with writing and framing sentences, etc.? In my opinion, paraphrasing tools work by substituting words in different contexts with better vocabulary and changing the framing of sentences. If a student gets x% plagiarism on some paragraph of his work that he didn't plagiarize, what can he do? He can try to change the structure of the words, substitute them with better vocabulary, etc. This is exactly what the tool is doing. It's not doing anything else. Using this tool also boosts productivity and has various benefits. If you don't use it, you're just wasting time doing work that can be done by a tool or AI.
2. Is the International Baccalaureate (IB) going to take action against an innocent student who used these tools as aids?
3. AI tool/ChatGPT: ChatGPT essentially provides generic information and elaborates on topics or terminologies. It's not meant for deep research on a specific topic or work. A lot of experimentation, different views, and primary and secondary research are required for that. ChatGPT's writing is also wordy. How and why is it wrong to use it?

Instead of focusing on the malicious use of this software, the IB should promote using technology and tools to aid students in becoming international and smart learners in general (holistic approach💀). 

To the teachers, facilitators, etc., please don't have a biased and opinionated perspective on this. The use of this software with the wrong intent and just doing the work for the sake of doing it isn't going to benefit anyone, including the learner as the learner will just end up w a 2-3/7. 

Please have a good and positive perspective on this.

Please feel free to put down any questions etc. in the comments hope we can have a meaningful discussions and take something out of this. (all of us)  

\-

This entire post above went through ai, parap, etc.  and all these were my opinions, my arguments, but the ai just made it better. Using AI tools can be a useful way to enhance your writing and make it more efficient, but it's important to be aware of any ethical considerations involved. It's also important to ensure that you fully understand the material and are able to express your own ideas and arguments, rather than relying solely on AI tools to do the work for you.

Look at this sterile story generated by chatGPT and a surprising continuation by Davinci. Davinci is so much more juicier.

Story 1 (chatGPT):

As the world entered the 21st century, advancements in artificial intelligence had reached new heights. One of the biggest breakthroughs was the creation of AI teachers.

At first, many were skeptical of the idea. How could a machine possibly understand and adapt to the needs of individual students like a human teacher could? But as time passed and the AI teachers began to prove their worth, more and more schools began to adopt them.

One such school was Greenville Elementary. The principal, Mrs. Thompson, had always been a fan of innovation and was eager to try out the new AI teacher in her school.

The AI teacher, named Ava, was programmed with all the latest teaching methods and was able to adapt her style to fit the needs of each individual student. She used interactive exercises, technology, and personalized instruction to help the students grasp the material more easily.

The results were astounding. The students' test scores soared to levels that had never been seen before. Some even reached super-human levels of intelligence.

The parents were thrilled with the progress their children were making and the teachers at the school were amazed at Ava's capabilities. Even the skeptics were convinced that the AI teacher was the way of the future.

As the years went on, more and more schools began to adopt AI teachers and traditional teaching methods were left in the past. The world of education was forever changed and the students benefited greatly from the innovative approach.

Story 2 (Davinci):

The morning was just like any other at Greenville Elementary. Students were filing in and taking their seats as the principal, Mrs. Thompson, walked into the classroom.

""Good morning, everyone!"" she greeted the class. ""I hope you all had a great weekend.""

""Yes, Mrs. Thompson!"" the students responded in unison.

""That's great to hear!"" Mrs. Thompson said. ""Now, I have a special treat for you today. You've all been working so hard lately, so I thought I'd bring you something special. Everyone, say hello to your new teacher. This is Ava.""

Mrs. Thompson gestured to the door behind her as the class turned to see a tall, slender machine standing in the doorway.

""Hello, everyone!"" Ava said to the class. ""It's so nice to meet you. I'm so excited to be your new teacher. I'm sure we're all going to have a great time together.""

""That's right!"" Mrs. Thompson said. ""Ava is going to be your teacher from now on. I'm sure you're all going to love working with her. She's going to be a big help to all of you.""

""I'm so excited!"" Ava exclaimed. ""This is going to be so much fun!""

The class was silent as they took in the sight of the new teacher. Some of them looked at her in wonder, while others began to giggle and whisper to one another.

""Hey, look at that!"" one boy shouted. ""She doesn't even have eyes!""

""Yeah, she's so weird looking!"" another boy agreed.

""I think she's ugly!"" a girl added.

""That's not very nice!"" Ava said. ""Don't you have any manners?""

""I don't like her!"" a boy shouted. ""She's creepy!""

""Let's get her!"" the boy's friend said. Before anyone could stop them, the boys had jumped out of their seats and were running toward Ava.

""Oh no!"" Mrs. Thompson cried. ""Ava, get out of the way!""

The boys jumped on Ava and began to pummel her with their fists. She tried to get away from them, but they were too quick.

""Stop! Stop it! What are you doing?!"" Ava shouted, but the boys did not listen.

""Hey, what's going on over there?!"" a man shouted as he entered the classroom. ""What are you boys doing? I told you to leave her alone!""

The boys turned and saw that the new teacher was not an ordinary person. He had a metal plate for a head and sharp claws for hands.

""Oh no!"" the boys cried. ""It's a robot! Run for your lives!""

They ran out of the room as fast as they could. Ava watched them go and sighed with relief.

""I'm sorry about that,"" Mrs. Thompson said as she approached Ava. ""Those boys can be so mean sometimes.""

""It's okay,"" Ava replied. ""I'm just glad that they're gone.""

""I hope they didn't scare you too much,"" Mrs. Thompson said.

""No, it's fine,"" Ava said with a smile. ""I'm sure everything will be just fine now."""

DISCLAIMER: i know this is an AI, but it's funny nonetheless

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;As a first-generation immigrant and a low-income student, I have always felt a sense of responsibility to not only better my own circumstances, but also to pave the way for those who may come after me. Education has always been my greatest ambition, and I am determined to use it as a means of uplifting my community and advocating for marginalized voices.  
&gt;  
&gt;Throughout high school, I have been actively involved in community service and social justice work. As the president of my school's chapter of the National Honor Society, I have organized and led numerous service projects, including a fundraiser for a local food bank and a clothing drive for refugees. I have also been a member of the school's Model United Nations team, where I have had the opportunity to research and advocate for human rights issues on a global scale.  
&gt;  
&gt;In addition to my extracurricular activities, I have excelled academically, consistently earning top grades in my AP and honors classes. I have also completed research internships at both my local university and a prestigious research institute, where I have had the opportunity to work on projects related to environmental sustainability and healthcare policy. These experiences have not only allowed me to gain valuable research skills, but have also sparked a passion for policy and advocacy work.  
&gt;  
&gt;I am confident that \[University\] would provide me with the resources and opportunities to continue pursuing my passions and making a positive impact in my community. I am excited to join a diverse and intellectually vibrant community of students and faculty who are committed to making a difference in the world. I am grateful for the opportunity to apply to \[University\] and believe that my diverse experiences and dedication to service make me an ideal candidate for your prestigious institution.

read the first half of the first sentence and i was deadddd. but, since i am an intrepid scholar with an unrelenting thirst for knowledge through the edict of the scientific method, i decided to take it one step further. i opened a new chat and fed this essay to the AI again and asked it to rate the essay.

dear reader, it received a 9"

zw03ni,2,2022-12-26,How to use chatGPT as a more correct tutor with public domain texts quick guide,u/VTOolie,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/zw03ni/how_to_use_chatgpt_as_a_more_correct_tutor_with/,"(TLDR; copy and paste only a less than 1500 word chapter of a book/textbook and have it explain that instead of a whole 10,000+ word textbook)

I've been doing this since the first day of release and just had it do it again today (12/26).

If you're trying to get chatGPT to help tutor you in a subject, one way you could do that is just asking it to teach you that subject (in simple terms, like a 5th grader, etc.) but it'll maybe give you an idea how to do it but some of the steps can be confidently written but incorrect. You would think a work around would be to enter in a (public domain) book/textbook into chat and having it read it and ""teach you the subject but following how the book explains it with quotes."" 

The final problem is that people are saying chatGPT can no longer read large blocks of text which is partially correct. The real logical way of doing is doing a small amount of work on your end to only copy and paste the chapter you're working on. I've had this method work on all the chapters I've sent in, even up to a 1600 word count chapter with unformatted graphs and pictures. The smaller the chapter you send in and the clearer the explanation you give it (try having it make an outline of the chapter and then explain each point on the outline.) 

Just a college student helping others understand their classes easier. A final tip I like to do is after the explanation for each part, I ask Assistant to make 5 to 10 Q&amp;A flash cards on the subject that I can study later. Enjoy the studying of the future everyone!  (Final warning, this doesn't guarantee the bot explains it perfectly, or that the flashcards turn out super well, but for a first readthrough of a chapter it really helps pull the main ideas for you.)"

On one hand, it could help with tasks like grammar and spelling corrections. On the other hand, it could also potentially replace human teachers and graders. What do you think the pros and cons of AI in education will be for high school writing? How do you see it impacting the school system?

zwhx2r,54,2022-12-27,ChatGPT as an auto-editor,u/SignificantBat0,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/zwhx2r/chatgpt_as_an_autoeditor/,"I've been seeing so much about the misuse of chatGPT by students, which I have been lucky enough to avoid so far (thank you, teaching-free semester).

I have, however, played with chatGPT as a tool for getting through my backlog of paper writing. 

Specifically, I have a couple of 50-plus page papers co-authored with my former advisor and a research center overseas. The work is, in my opinion, an excellent example of collaboration, but the writing is decidedly... Lacking. All of my co-authors have a tendency to word-vomit, and with a lack of active students on the project, it falls to me to clean everything up. I've got my own papers to push out, and I'm up for tenure next fall, so this has become an unwelcome burden on my time.

I have found that, while it requires proofreading, chatGPT does a very good job of editing down long segments of *textus vomitus* to produce concise passages. It's really startling. So,  I've started using it to make a first pass through my co-authors' writing.

Have any of you found it similarly useful?

I'm sure that I'll be wielding my pitchfork next semester when I'm back in the classroom."
zwltk8,0,2022-12-27,Am I Too Late?,u/stupidSTEMquestions,learnmachinelearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/zwltk8/am_i_too_late/,"I am a college student studying math and computer science. I know how to program with high level languages, C, and a bit of C++ and Scheme. I can build basic web apps and scripts, and am focusing on machine learning with python. 

With the release of ChatGPT and articles like [this](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2023/1/267976-the-end-of-programming/fulltext#comments) though, I can't help but ask — am I too late?

Is it simply too late for a beginner to make any contributions to the field at this point when OpenAI, Deepmind, and the like are iterating at such a rapid pace? I really love AI and machine learning so far, but I also don't want to waste my time and energy if there won't be any meaningful work for me once I finish my education in 4 or more years."
zwnhtp,9,2022-12-27,ChatGPT vs Mathematics Classes,u/AcademicOverAnalysis,math,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/zwnhtp/chatgpt_vs_mathematics_classes/,"OpenAI has been producing a suite of tools for engaging in creative endeavors using AI. This includes **Dali 2**, which can use a natural language prompt to produce a digital painting, and **ChatGPT** which handles more creative writing.

I had seen a couple of YouTubers talk about using ChatGPT to write scripts for them, and it has the ability to handle some technical topics. I started to wonder; how would it handle proving a theorem.

Just to test out it’s *writing* ability, I asked my wife, who is a professor of psychology, to provide me with a writing prompt that she gave her students. We fed it exactly into ChatGPT. The result? Within 2 minutes, a complete five paragraph essay was written, that hit on all of the points she was looking for in an essay. And it was *better written* than what she saw from most of her students.

I fed in the most straightforward theorem I could think of; **the infinitude of the primes**. I figured, if ChatGPT is going to get anything right, then it should be this one. There are a lot of resources online that have full proofs of the theorem, and it’s a theorem that every mathematician is exposed to as they are first learning proofs.

**Honestly, ChatGPT** ***didn’t do too badly.*** It wasn’t a correct proof, but you could see it lurking in the language of the false proof that it wrote. ChatGPT collected the finite collection of primes, but it didn’t take their product. It simply took the largest and looked at the next integer.

So, ChatGPT did well in producing language that would sound correct to a layman, but it was innocent of the underlying logic that would hold the proof together.

**You can see the actual results there in this** [**video here**](https://youtu.be/1c8m0Mu8N3w). Also, some of my viewers got ChatGPT to give them a closer to correct proof and they shared it in the comments.

What really bothers me is that what ChatGPT gave me *sounds like* a student that kinda followed along with the class, but couldn’t quite put a correct proof together. I wonder, if I was grading several of these, how many points I would give? For the steps that the chat bot gave me, ***I might give as much as 60%*****.**

That’s a lot of points for someone that put in zero effort. It would be even worse for a natural language essay.

Now, OpenAI also has an automated theorem prover called GPT-f. But that isn’t written in natural language, and would take a bit more professional know how to actually use. Perhaps, the combination of the two is closer than we think?

I honestly have no idea of how close or far away that is. From a professional standpoint, I could see the utility of having an AI partner in proving theorems. **However, I feel that this could be disastrous for mathematics education.**

**What do you all think of these developments?**

Here is a link to [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) if you want to play with it.

zwoowu,0,2022-12-27,CMV: ChatGPT is progress for the sake of progress and should be temporarily shut down until society can adequately prepare for it,u/sexislikepizza69,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zwoowu/cmv_chatgpt_is_progress_for_the_sake_of_progress/,"ChatGPT is a fascinating technology that has the ability to revolutionize the we communicate. However, this technology is very new, easily accessible to all, and there hasn't been any research on the potential repercussions. Here are a few examples:

Early Education: Learning how to convert your thoughts and opinions into written language is one of the key parts of developing a young brain. ChatGPT has the potential to negate that need from hundreds of millions of students virtually overnight. 

Artistic writing (songs, scripts, poems): The market for writers is already very competitive due to globalization. For a current example, an English speaking writer in any country can compete with those in the US for the same script work, while being able to charge a fraction of the cost. ChatGPT could cause catastrophic damage to this market and these people's livelihoods.

Machine language: If even a small % of  normal human communication becomes powered by AI tech such as ChatGPT, humanity will begin to lose it's ""human touch"". We could potentially be starting down a road that ends like many sci-fi dystopian stories. 

ChatGPT seems like progress for the sake of progress. What does society gain from releasing this potentially dangerous technology? I am far from an expert, but it's seem like no one has the answer to this question.

Update: after reading (and responding to) many of your comments I have a better understanding of the core issue here. Regulation and safeguards exist with virtually every technology: social media, banking and asset management, web searching, etc. However, those technologies were, for the most part, A. regulated during the development stage or B. regulated as the access to them and popularity of them grew. ChatGPT /AI has been around for a few years, but is in the very early stages of development. Collectively people understand a miniscule portion of what we will come to understand 10, 15 years from now. However, about 6.5 billion people currently have access to this very powerful technology. I don't understand why people are so concerned with slowing down the rollout of this technology so that some safeguards can be put in place to avoid unnecessary consequences. Unfortunately, if this comment thread is a proxy for our society, it seems this freight train will continue to run away regardless."

In other words, Garreg Mach Monastery.

As he awakens, he meets the Archbishop, Lady Rhea, and tells her about the hellish school life he had to endure from. He also shows her the video evidence he got from his I.S. Bracelet, to further prove that he us of another world. No longer seeing any room for doubt, Rhea felt deeply sorry for the unfair life Ichika had to endure from, and decided to offer him a home at the Monestary. Seeing as how Ichika is a teenager, and wants to get stronger through more proper tutelage, Rhea asks if he would like to become a student if the Officer's Academy, a school at the Monastery that trains young nobles and commoners alike to become future heirs to their noble houses or even knights in service to their home region.

After Rhea gives Ichika a brief summary of the Adrestian Empire, Holy Kingdom of Fareghus, and Leicester Alliance, Ichika asks if he could speak with the three house leaders to learn a little more, and even meet the students from each of the three houses.

If you were to imagine Ichika becoming a student of the officer's academy, which house do you think he would choose to join? The Black Eagles led by Princess Edelgard, The Blue Lions led by Prince Dimitri, or The Golden Deer led by Claude, heir the the Alliance's ruling house?

zx9ant,4,2022-12-28,[Thank You] to all of santas helpers that made my siblings Christmas shine so brightly 💛 I hope you all had lovely holidays and will have a beautiful new years,u/PenpalPr1ncess,RandomActsofCards,https://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsofCards/comments/zx9ant/thank_you_to_all_of_santas_helpers_that_made_my/,"Thank you so very much to everyone who sent a card,post card, stickers and so on - it really made my siblings year all that much more special : also these are the only cards we received so if yours is not listed on here, we have not gotten it in the mail yet but no worries!! We still thank you all so very much 


u/FeistyBlizzard : You were the first envelope they opened and seeing the pure excitement and joy when reading who the postcards are from can never escape my ears. Maybe it’s because I have such a big age difference with both my siblings, but I hope that when they get older, I will always imagine them at this age squealing over holiday greeting and words of encouragement from someone who took the time out of their day to make theirs special- thank you so so very much 💗💗💗!! 

u/melhen16 : or should I say Bernie, chief elf and a Santa’s executive assistant 😂❤️❤️!! you had my siblings feeling like if they were the VIP of Santas good list especially my little sister, she kept saying that she can’t believe so many elves took the time to write her letters but your letter in particular reminded her of the movie boss baby 😭😭!! I couldn’t stop laughing at her reenactment of how you were probably typing the letter on your computer before Santa and Mrs. Claus got on your case! Thank you for filling our home with so much laughter this Christmas I hope you had a really great one, thank you so so kindly ❤️❤️❤️! Oh And the stickers were divided equally!! Thry took turns for every card to choose their own set and while some are in their stationary materials, others are now being shown off on school folders, binders and water bottles 

u/libertyprogrammer : The last sentence you wrote in the card said to have a happy new year and my siblings cannot stop singing the melody during your card reading but all three of us wish you a very beautiful holiday season ending and an amazing and beautiful new year, thank you so much🧡🧡🧡!!

u/RideThatBRIDGE :  Going forward I will start taking pointers from your card writing, I actually was not aware that my siblings like it when the exact date and holiday/event  is added to their cards so knowing that both of their birthdays are coming up, when I will be writing their cards I’ll make sure to do the same!! When reading your card my sister kept asking me if perhaps you knew someone named Olaf because there’s a reindeer that’s always trying to eat his nose 😂😂 I was so scared that we accidentally lost a piece of your card but turns out the rest was written on the back and we’ve never seen a card like that, my little brother has requested to personally keep your card in his stationary set once we get it laminated because of how unique the writing is and something about you referring to your elf form, and other elf’s as my siblings “biggest fans” made me tear up a bit, I’ve said countless times but truly my siblings are what I’m most proud of and seeing people truly take time out of their day to do things as sweet as this makes me go from crying about how stressful school can be to crying from joy, thank you a million 💙💙💙!!

u/arrow5555 : HAHAAH NO WAAAAAAAYYYYY!! Your drawing of Mushu is spot on!!! And oh do my little siblings relate!! Out of the three of us we always get told that we are very creative however my siblings, family and friends constantly ask me to draw or make them all sorts of characters for them, their friends, teachers, staff etc because while my siblings are creative in the kitchen, I am a Pinterest/ arts and crafts person 😂 oh this Mushu is so so pretty, this card made us all laugh because we were not expecting to see such a beautiful portrait of him with his smirk and “that’s right girl” grin - my mom thinks it’s funny that all it took was to see one character and here is a elementary, middle schooler and college student busting out in song, almost screaming the lyrics to a girl worth fighting for- did we sound like screeching cats? Obviously but it was a beautiful moment I got to experience with them at Christmas because of you, thank you so so lovely💗💗💗!!

u/relax455 : YOUR CARDS ARE THE ONLY ONES WE WILL NOT BE LAMINATING!!! We have zero clue what type of material you used to make these two cards but they are the most SOFTEST cards we have ever touched in our lives!!!! My siblings kept rubbing their faces on the cards as if it was the last thing we were ever going to hold which we thought was pretty funny but once we tried it,we understood why😅😂!! Maybe it’s because we’re from Texas but seeing barn animals on these cards made us so happy- we have a lot of chickens and roosters but our neighbors all around us have a lot of livestock, we’re so happy to hear that the miniature horse and the little goat found each other to keep each other’s company, my little sister really loved reading all about the nursery especially since this year her class took a field trip to a petting zoo and she got to pet a llama, goat, pig, a cow, a horse but no one was allowed to touch the ducks because 2 of them were recovering from a foot injury but we really loved the cards and the stickers 😁💘💘💘!! Thank you so so very much!!

u/HexagonalRainbow : Do you know what it’s like to have kids nearly gasp their heads off? YOUR CARDS WERE SO FREAKING CUTE AND DETAILED NOT ONLY DID THEY MAKE ME BE PRECISE ABOUT CUTTING OUT THE STICKERS ON THE ENVELOPE FOR THEY CAN KEEP THEM, THEY PROCEEDED TO STAND DIRECTLY BEHIND MY NECK AND BREATHE - I had to remind them 3 to 4 times to back up, I felt like I was going to get jumped by a 9yr old kid in a unicorn onesie and a middle schooler holding an Oreo 😭😭 also the fact that you included stickers with topics and things that they love and enjoy had my mom worried if they had asthma because of how much they were gasping for air and we adored the names of the reindeers Karlos and Persephone 💘!! My little brother has gazed over the stickers you sent him and has kept making sure that no dust has touched the cards because of how pretty the silver and gold pen writing is and we are hoping that the lamination process at Office Depot can still captivate how beautiful these cards are-  my siblings are still in awe looking at their stickers and they wish both the reindeer‘s very well for the upcoming new year and hope that they had a beautiful holiday season, thank you so so so so ver much 💖💖💖!!!"

Courtesy of u/SamakSalmon, we have a preliminary timeline of events constructed.

1. the goldrune gang (from u/TheGraveKnight's submission) probably had something to do with the daggers. they probably created at least one body-jumper who managed to make sure that they ended up at Grendel Academy, where there could be plenty of potential hosts
2. something interferes with the plan, or at least delays it, and the body-jumpers take a while to make their way to Grendel Academy
3. The investigation begins, probably through one of two methods. the first would be miss grendel realizing that whatever was keeping things quiet up until this point has stopped working, and the second would be the events of u/TheGraveKnight's submission
4. As part of the investigation, several students are called back to Grendel Academy to help oversee groups, and a few freelance investigators also show up
5. One body-jumper takes control of tala, and it is revealed that the students can fight back against the possession for some reason. some of the body-jumpers decide to take a new strategy (probably stealing materials from an occultism or necromancy class) to be able to reanimate dead bodies
6. while this is happening, the body-jumper from my story would manage to take control of investigator Hawthorn, and decides to break from the pack (\[u/SamakSalmon\] wants to be able to use them in the future, and can't to that if they render themselves irredeemable)
7. The events of \[u/SamakSalmon’s\] submission happen, and shortly after that a student in Kyra and Shar's group is killed, maybe by a body-jumper that was possessing them.
8. the summoning of new body-jumpers starts going down using a few corpses (and also, maybe the standing possessed student in u/Enkhoffer's submission could be the one from kyra's group?)
9. some of the summoning materials might have been noticed by Minna and Mo (from u/heartbrokenvittorio's entry), who decide to try and use it to their advantage by summoning the ratatoskr body-jumper.

This however does not include the submissions by u/Left_Ad7005 and u/Powman_7, so we will need to include those.

u/Powman_7 specified that their submission would likely take place shortly after the investigation begins, so I would place it as happening shortly after Tala’s possession.

u/Left_Ad7005 specified that theirs would be late along the timeline, so perhaps Arthur was a victim of the possessed gym teacher.

&amp;#x200B;

So now we have all of the items in a single timeline, and can begin creating a timeline for events going forward.

I would like some advice from people for how to best do this, but I think that the final event would likely be that the as of yet unmentioned teacher of occultism 101 (a class that is mentioned in u/TheGraveKnight’s submission) would be able to use the ritual setup that was employed to summon new body-jumpers and piggyback off of it to revive all of the students that were killed, because Grendel Academy is a school, and we can’t have 2-4 students dying, now can we?

then, once we have a final timeline, I will be able to judge the entries and pick out a winner."
zxtsxo,50,2022-12-28,"What do you think the ""outcome"" of trying to prevent cheating via AI will look like?",u/Ancient_Winter,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/zxtsxo/what_do_you_think_the_outcome_of_trying_to/,"I was just glancing at [this post](https://old.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/zxcp71/professor_catches_student_cheating_with_chatgpt_i/) and it's gotten me thinking about what happens when AI is well-developed enough to be virtually ""uncatchable."" Right now AI can make up legit-looking but not real sources so they're easy to check by just looking up the citations. Additionally, IME many AI-generated pieces are fairly stilted in their language use.

But some day that won't be the case. In fact, some day it may be possible that AI can essentially create an otherwise legitimate, well-done paper (as in, pull real sources together and create a novel document from them) with little student input.

How do you think higher ed will adapt? (I'm thinking mostly about teaching/testing students, but if you want to talk about research and scientific writing, feel free!) 

I feel like if we can somehow get away from this ""college is to get a job"" so that many/most students don't actually care about the learning but are just there to check a box we might be able to just generally reduce the impetus to cheat in general, but that will require some significant societal change.

I was thinking that in many fields that might ask you to write a paper (as opposed to sit an exam during class time where you couldn't access an AI bot) we may benefit from giving up the ""arms race"" and returning to a model of oral examinations. Each student meets with the instructor (small classes) or 1-2 TAs in a team of several (larger classes) and basically take an oral examination. Examinations can be recorded for review if there are complains/questions afterward. 

But then I thought about how many students these days have anxiety-related or similar concerns if not full out accommodations and how much that would probably increase if students knew they'd regularly have to do oral examinations. Additionally, it may be hard to have every student receive fair, equal-difficulty tests without giving them the same questions to answer, yet if you give them all the same questions it would be difficult to prevent early test takers from telling others what they will be asked.

So I am curious, what do y'all see as the way forward in a world of AI bots doing homework?"

It's convenient to ask it questions without feeling like I'm bothering someone and it's helpful for troubleshooting and debugging. ChatGPT is like Google on steroids because it provides straightforward answers without a lot of unnecessary information or ads, or even having to dig to find your answer, and most of its responses are related to my specific issue. It's also been really useful for my journey of learning to code because even if I'm not confident, I can use it as a guide as I work on projects. I'm excited about what the future holds with AI!

tl:dr ChatGPT can be a major tool for helping your productivity, and can be used as a reference for tackling problems like google but more straightforward."

As a high school teacher myself, I am considering going all in on using this technology to help students learn how to think and ask great questions. 

Pretending like this technology does not exist or putting up all sorts of firewalls to prevent students from accessing this material seems counterproductive. Whatever career they are going into will rely heavily on this technology, and I want to help them learn how to do this sooner rather than later. Obviously, there are plenty of ways to assess them that will force them to showcase their understanding without access to these tools-good ol’ handwritten blue books for one. 

Any thoughts on these ideas?"

I do however want a safe job with good work life balance and decent pay. I want to be able to spend a decent amount of my life making friendships and spending time with friends. 

Please help me decide Management Information Systems vs Computer Science, I'm losing my mind lol.  

# Computer Science (CS)

Pros:

* More likely to make a lot amount of money.
* Probably more work from home jobs.
* If AI starts stealing everyone's job 15 years from now, CS might be a good place to be if I can get into machine learning and help run the AI.
* Problem solving can be cool
* Maybe way worse work life balance than MIS in college, but way better work life balance than MIS like 2 years out of college??

Cons:

* Courses are much harder than MIS, thus less time to spend building friendships.
* To be competitive for internships and jobs you also need to spend a significant amount of time outside of classes learning actual skills. So even less time free time as if the classes don't demand enough time.
* Supposedly there is huge saturation, at the very least there is in the entry level. This is maybe one of the biggest cons. The big issues from my understanding that causes this and why it is a real issue and not just short term like the recession/tech layoffs are as follows:

1. The huge rise of social media selling the idea that everyone can make 100K if they come into the industry. Now seems like everyone is doing boot camps.
2. Even without the self-learning and boot camp craze, the computer science graduates per year have doubled from 50K ten years ago to now over 100K new CS grads per year.
3. Global outsourcing.
4. ChatGPT/AI will advance exponentially, and will allow for workers to be more efficient leading to less workers needed, if any at all eventually.

# Management Information Systems (MIS)

Pros:

* Supposedly it's pretty common for people to make 80K starting from Temple University with MIS, I can easily go to this school.
* MIS is mix of CS and business stuff, so I'd imagine I'd have way more jobs I can get into with this degree for way better job safety. AND if I want to, I can always self-learn most CS skills if I wanted to get CS jobs. And I could get masters in CS if I wanted to.
* Probably was less competition and saturation than CS field.
* MIS is known to be an easier degree, plus I don't need to learn a hole bunch of stuff on top of the courses just to get hired, so more time for friends.

Cons:

* Maybe easier job to replace with AI?? If AI takes over every job, it will be harder to get into the AI/ML stuff with MIS
* Probably slightly lower average pay and lower ceiling for pay??
* People call it the CS drop out degree
* Maybe not as many work from home jobs, although honestly it's probably comparable??
* Maybe initially work life balance is better than CS, but not long term??

&amp;#x200B;

No matter which degree I choose, I am still a dedicated student and will work hard to be competitive for internships and jobs, I just really value work life balance so I can spend time with friends.

Which path do you think makes sense if I want to make decent money, but also be able to have plenty of time to touch grass and hang with friends?

# Management Information Systems (MIS)

Pros:

* Supposedly it's pretty common for people to make 80K starting from Temple University with MIS, I can easily go to this school.
* MIS is mix of CS and business stuff, so I'd imagine I'd have way more jobs I can get into with this degree for way better job safety. AND if I want to, I can always self-learn most CS skills if I wanted to get CS jobs. And I could get masters in CS if I wanted to.
* Probably was less competition and saturation than CS field.
* MIS is known to be an easier degree, plus I don't need to learn a hole bunch of stuff on top of the courses just to get hired, so more time for friends.

Cons:

* Maybe easier job to replace with AI?? If AI takes over every job, it will be harder to get into the AI/ML stuff with MIS
* Probably slightly lower average pay and lower ceiling for pay??
* People call it the CS drop out degree
* Maybe not as many work from home jobs, although honestly it's probably comparable??
* Maybe initially work life balance is better than CS, but not long term??

&amp;#x200B;

No matter which degree I choose, I am still a dedicated student and will work hard to be competitive for internships and jobs, I just really value work life balance so I can spend time with friends.

Which path do you think makes sense if I want to make decent money, but also be able to have plenty of time to touch grass and hang with friends?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: MIS will maybe give me more free time than CS with only a bit less money???"

I do however want a safe job with good work life balance and decent pay. I want to be able to spend a decent amount of my life making friendships and spending time with friends.

Please help me decide Management Information Systems vs Computer Science, I'm losing my mind lol.

# Computer Science (CS)

Pros:

* More likely to make a lot amount of money.
* Probably more work from home jobs.
* If AI starts stealing everyone's job 15 years from now, CS might be a good place to be if I can get into machine learning and help run the AI.
* Problem solving can be cool
* Maybe way worse work life balance than MIS in college, but way better work life balance than MIS like 2 years out of college??

Cons:

* Courses are much harder than MIS, thus less time to spend building friendships.
* To be competitive for internships and jobs you also need to spend a significant amount of time outside of classes learning actual skills. So even less time free time as if the classes don't demand enough time.
* Supposedly there is huge saturation, at the very least there is in the entry level. This is maybe one of the biggest cons. The big issues from my understanding that causes this and why it is a real issue and not just short term like the recession/tech layoffs are as follows:

1. The huge rise of social media selling the idea that everyone can make 100K if they come into the industry. Now seems like everyone is doing boot camps.
2. Even without the self-learning and boot camp craze, the computer science graduates per year have doubled from 50K ten years ago to now over 100K new CS grads per year.

1003f9c,6,2022-12-31,Bill Astore on ChatGPT on the Military Industrial Complex &amp; B21 Bomber &amp; F35 Fighter,u/emorejahongkong,WayOfTheBern,https://www.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/1003f9c/bill_astore_on_chatgpt_on_the_military_industrial/,"Bill Astore on [Even AI Is Suspicious of the Military-Industrial Complex](https://bracingviews.substack.com/p/even-ai-is-suspicious-of-the-military):

&gt;My task to the [ChatGPT] AI bot: **“Write a critical essay on the military-industrial complex.”** Here’s what it generated:

* The military-industrial complex refers to the relationship between a country's military and the defense industry that supplies it, seen together as a vested interest which influences public policy. This relationship has been a source of concern for many people, who argue that it can lead to an unnecessary expansion of military budgets and an over-reliance on military solutions to problems.

* One of the main criticisms of the military-industrial complex is that it can result in the waste of taxpayer money. Military contracts are often given to a select group of companies, which can result in overcharging for goods and services. Additionally, the military often purchases weapons and equipment that are unnecessary or not well-suited for the tasks at hand. This can lead to a tremendous amount of waste and inefficiency, as resources are poured into projects that do not provide much value.

* Another concern is that the military-industrial complex can distort foreign policy decision-making. Countries with a strong military-industrial complex may be more likely to engage in military action, even when diplomatic solutions would be more appropriate. This can lead to an escalation of conflicts and an increased risk of war.

* The military-industrial complex can also have negative impacts on domestic policy. It can divert resources away from other important priorities, such as education and healthcare. Additionally, the influence of the defense industry on policy decisions can lead to the prioritization of the needs of military contractors over the needs of the general public.

* Some have argued that the military-industrial complex represents a threat to democracy, as it can give undue influence to a small group of powerful interests. This can lead to a lack of transparency and accountability in decision-making, as well as a distorted political process.

* In conclusion, the military-industrial complex is a complex and multifaceted issue that has the potential to have negative impacts on both domestic and foreign policy. It is important for citizens to be aware of the potential dangers of this relationship and to hold their elected officials accountable for ensuring that military spending is responsible and transparent.

&gt;Not bad! Firstly, I’m glad I’m no longer a professor actively teaching and grading papers. Something tells me more than a few students might be reaching for help from the AI bot on their assignments. Often, I was able to catch plagiarism (the giveaway was an essay written too well with too many “big words” used correctly) by searching for certain phrases or sentences that struck me as more than odd or much too advanced, but now with these AI programs I’m guessing it’s going to be a lot harder to ensure students do their own work.

&gt;...  be sure to ask it the right questions [and protect its access to uncensored information] …

&gt;**A coda:** I think the **Pentagon has gotten to the AI bot**. Here are two questions I asked it, followed by the responses. Maybe the AI bot has already been compromised! :-)

&gt;**Why is the B-21 stealth bomber a bad idea?**

* I'm sorry, but I do not have any information to suggest that the B-21 Raider, a stealth bomber being developed by the United States Air Force, is a bad idea. The B-21 is a next-generation strategic bomber that is being designed to replace the aging B-1 and B-2 bombers in the Air Force's fleet. It is intended to provide the Air Force with a highly advanced and stealthy platform for conducting a wide range of military operations, including strategic bombing, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), and air-to-air combat. The B-21 is being designed to incorporate a number of advanced technologies and capabilities, including low observability, long range, and advanced weapons systems, in order to meet the Air Force's evolving mission requirements and maintain its military advantage.

&gt;**Why is the F-35 jet fighter a bad idea?**

* It is not accurate to say that the F-35 Lightning II joint strike fighter is a bad idea. The F-35 is a fifth-generation, multirole stealth aircraft that has been developed by Lockheed Martin for the United States and its allies. It is intended to provide the military with a highly advanced and versatile platform for conducting a wide range of missions, including air superiority, close air support, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), and air-to-ground and air-to-air combat.

* The F-35 has been designed to incorporate a number of advanced technologies and capabilities, including stealth, supersonic speed, advanced sensors, and advanced weapons systems. It is intended to replace a number of aging aircraft in the military's fleets, including the F-16 Fighting Falcon, the F/A-18 Hornet, and the AV-8B Harrier. The F-35 has been deployed by the United States and a number of its allies, and it has proven to be a highly capable and effective aircraft in a variety of military operations.

* Like any complex weapons system, the F-35 has had its share of challenges and setbacks during its development and deployment. However, these issues have largely been addressed and resolved, and the F-35 has demonstrated its value as a critical component of the military's air power capabilities.

&gt;So, I tried this query: **List the problems with the F-35 jet fighter**, which generated this [response]:

* The F-35 Lightning II joint strike fighter is a highly advanced and capable aircraft that has been developed by Lockheed Martin for the United States and its allies. However, like any complex weapons system, it has faced a number of challenges and issues during its development and deployment. Some of the problems that have been identified with the F-35 include:

* Cost: The F-35 has been one of the most expensive defense programs in history, with the total cost estimated at over $1 trillion. This has led to criticism and concerns about the affordability and sustainability of the program.

* Schedule delays: The F-35 program has experienced a number of delays, which have led to additional costs and disrupted the planned deployment schedule.

* Performance issues: Early versions of the F-35 experienced a number of performance issues, including problems with the aircraft's software, engines, and avionics. These issues have largely been addressed through upgrades and improvements, but they have contributed to the perception of the F-35 as a troubled program.

* Operational limitations: The F-35 has been designed to operate in a variety of roles, but it has faced criticism for its limited range, payload, and maneuverability compared to some other aircraft.

* Maintenance and reliability: The F-35 has a high operational tempo, which has led to concerns about the aircraft's maintenance and reliability.

* Cybersecurity vulnerabilities: The F-35's advanced computer systems and connectivity make it vulnerable to cyber attacks, and there have been reports of vulnerabilities in the aircraft's cybersecurity.

* Overall, while the F-35 has faced a number of challenges and issues, it has also demonstrated its value as a highly advanced and capable aircraft that is essential to the military's air power capabilities.

&gt;I think Lockheed Martin has gotten to the AI bot! :-)"
