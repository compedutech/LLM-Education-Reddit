Every student had their own login, and the login page (or the page that showed while it was logging you in?) was a brick school with a school bus in front. Once you logged on, it looked like you were seated at a desk with various school items to click on. I believe there was a notebook, and sticky notes that let you send messages to other students in the school (it was not an instant messenger; the messages would show up on their “desk” the next time they logged in).

I asked ChatGPT, and it suggested The Learning Odyssey/Odyssey/Compass Learning, but Google results for that do not look right.  "
1eh7602,135,2024-07-31,Finished as someone with NO prior experience. Review of all classes.,u/vwin90,WGU_CompSci,https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU_CompSci/comments/1eh7602/finished_as_someone_with_no_prior_experience/,"There are others that have made this post, but I think it would be helpful if people gave context to who they are and their level of proficiencies so that others can more accurately predict how the experience will go for them.

  
**Who I am:**

*  Early 30s male
* Wife and kid (toddler)
* Working full time while doing the degree in an unrelated field (High school AP physics teacher)
* No prior work experience in the tech field
* Did a Udemy course about 2 months before enrollment, which taught basic programming (Angela Yu's 100 Days of Python... and I did about 20 days of that and had never coded before)
* Have always had a strong interest in tech and computers as a USER. Built my own custom gaming PC and in my childhood knew how to torrent pirated movies and games and how to follow tutorials to crack software without having any clue of what I was actually doing.
* ADHD, unmedicated but have always seemed to cope fine.
* Prior STEM bachelors degree from a top 40 college. Masters degree in education.
* I REALLY like math and logic, hence I teach AP Physics.
* I don't mind reading textbooks (mostly skimming) and always have had a knack for test taking.

**How long it took me and how hard I studied:**

* 2 years (4 terms total) although I probably could have done it in 1.5 if I didn't slack so hard in my 3rd term
* 8-10 hours a week studying. Some weeks it was 1-2 hours a night on the weekdays, other weeks I might do a burst of 3-4 hours on the weekends.
* I used ChatGPT to reinforce my studying. I'd often reexplain concepts to it and asked if I was being accurate. I did not use it to write any code, but would use it to help clean and debug my code if I was having issues. It's also very useful for quick questions like ""How do make a list out of just the values of this dictionary again?"" I never used it to write my papers for me, but might use it to bounce ideas off of before I started. I always used the PAID models to ensure I got better outputs. I started out paying $20 per month for ChatGPT Plus and eventually just learned how to use API keys so that I could access both ChatGPT and Claude for WAY cheaper through a chat client.
* I very infrequently met with course instructors. Instead, I might send an email if I need any clarifying questions. I didn't join the discord or anything. Guides on this subreddit were OKAY for some courses, but bad for others.
* I didn't do any of the acceleration tricks like taking the practice tests first thing. Almost every class, I just opened it up, started working through the textbook or study guide posted by the instructor, and then took the tests once I finished.

**What are my next steps?**

Honestly if the market was better, I'd be more aggressively applying. With all my other responsibilities, I never did an internship. By the time I felt ready for an internship anyways I was blazing through my last term because I left a lot of coding classes until the end.

  
I'm currently grinding leetcode and that's been fun. I'll probably start applying to jobs in a few months but will continue teaching this upcoming school year.

  
I did apply to GTech's OMSCS program. I figured I'll continue learning while job searching and can pause it if I land anything that I want. The problem is that I am already making a good amount of money ($115k /year) teaching, so I feel like I get to be picky. Maybe I'll do an internship next summer while I'm still doing the OMSCS program.

  
If I never transition out of teaching, that's okay too. This program has been fun and I really value knowledge in general. I can build apps to help automate my job and can also teach my students some programming too if I'd like.



**Overall thoughts:**

This is a good CS program in that it is HARD. Nobody finishes this program and thinks that it is comparable at all to a boot camp. You thoroughly have to learn most of the things you would at a traditional CS program, like architecture, OS, machine learning, DSA, discrete math, etc. If anybody is looking at this program as an easy way to get a CS degree, you're going to be disappointed. **It's not easy. It's just really convenient.**

  
There are some things missing that I wished was included, like linear algebra and a larger focus on advanced statistics. The difficulty of the courses are all over the place. Many of the courses are laughably easy, but the same can be said of many of my classes from my top 40 STEM degree. Some of these classes are so ridiculously hard, I seriously estimate that a big chunk of students drop out when they hit them and are humbled by how hard the degree is (DM2, Computer Architecture, Operating Systems, DSA2, Java Frameworks/Backend).

  
My overall opinion is somewhat mixed actually and leaning on the positive side. The program felt way easier than my first STEM bachelors, but maybe it's because I'm older and have a better work ethic. When I talk to my own former students who have finished or are in traditional CS programs at good schools, I can't help but feel like the WGU program might be on the easier side just based off of the description of what they're learning compared to what I'm learning. At the same time, people talk about how some folks get CS degrees from well known schools and come out being able to barely code or explain how computers work, and I CANNOT imagine that to be true of anybody that finishes the WGU program. It's extremely difficult to fake it through a lot of these courses because of the way the tests are proctored.

  
It's an unpopular opinion, but I'm glad the hardest classes are as hard as they are. It'll gatekeep the graduates of this program so that anybody that holds this degree will actually know their stuff when they get employed. If the program was easy to get through, you'd get a bunch of terrible graduates giving managers all over the world a bad outlook on the school. Instead, by keeping the program difficult to pass, it somewhat ensures that once any of us get hired, the school might get a positive reputation for cranking out capable individuals who can self-learn and self-manage properly.



**Alright enough! Just tell me about the classes**

I transferred in all my gen eds. I didn't do any of those Sophia/Straighterline/Saylor classes or anything.

  
Here are my thoughts on each class in the order I took them:



**Term 1:**

C182 Introduction to IT - Pretty easy. Clicked through all of the pages in about 3 hours total and took the test later that night. I think it does a good job giving you a preview of CS content so that you can decide yourself if this is the program for you. If you read the material and go ""wow that is SO boring,"" well the bad news is you're gonna burn out of this program because that's what you'll be learning for the rest of the program.

  
C958 Calculus I - Super easy. I took AP Calculus in high school and then again in college 15 years ago. Didn't take math higher than that, but I do teach physics for a living, so these ideas are part of my every day life. I used Khan Academy's Calc AB course and reviewed it over the course of a week. There's a few lessons in the Calc BC course that you need to do for integration by parts, but it wasn't bad. Buy yourself a TI-84 and learn how to use it. Use YouTube tutorials to teach yourself how to solve certain problems. There's very little that the calculator can't do. Aced the test.

  
C172 Network and Security Foundations - Also really easy, but sort of a chore to get through. I just read the material. I found people's recommended playlists to not be deep enough and took longer than just skimming the actual material. Aced the test after 2 weeks of reading. I probably should have taken notes though.

  
C836 Fundamentals of Information Security - Take this right after the C172 Network and Security Foundations class. There's a lot of overlap. This isn't a traditional textbook and is actually just a book about Network Security, so it reads a bit differently than a textbook. It's another 2 weeks of reading essentially. I think at this point, a student might find themselves either really interested in this stuff or not. If you are, you might as well switch to cybersecurity because that's what these two courses introduce.

  
C173 Scripting and Programming Foundations - Super easy if you already know coding basics. You don't even use a real language here, it's just pseudocode using something called Coral. Goes over things like if/else branches, for/while loops, variables, definitions, etc. but in a basic way. This class is for people who have NEVER coded before. Everyone else will be able to pass this class in less than a week of just reviewing over the material.



C779 Web Development Foundations - Dude I freaking hated this class. HTML and CSS and those languages are just NOT fun for me. You're just essentially memorizing what different tags do and making sure you know the syntax for it. I also made the mistake of thinking ""hey why don't I just do a udemy course on HTML or web dev?"" Ended up wasting so much time on it. Probably could have just read the book, taken notes, and passed over the course of a few weeks. Instead this class took me like 2 months because I was just not using my time wisely and also go busy in my normal life. Don't know if I actually hate HTML/CSS or if I just have a bad taste because of my experience in this class (which was totally my own doing).

  
C959 Discrete Math I - Ahhhhh the first class that felt worthy to me. I actually love this stuff. It comes naturally if you're good at logic, but even then there's a good amount of information, most of which you probably have never encountered. This class really feels like you're learning a ton of NEW information that you've never seen before, whereas a lot of the stuff prior to this is stuff that you're sort of familiar with (like routers and PCs and stuff). I liked this class a lot. I know people hate math, but if you're like me and like math, you'll enjoy this class. It took me a 6 weeks and I didn't miss a single question on the test.

  
**Term 2:**

C867 Scripting and Programming Applications - Another great class. This class is C++ and if it's your first foray into real coding, it might take awhile. I enjoyed going through the textbook and doing the built in exercises (mini easy leetcode problems) while learning the language, which can be daunting compared to python since it's more verbose. The project is sort of cool (not portfolio worthy though) and introduces you to C++ specific techniques like using pointers and deallocating memory when you code with objects. This course will teach you OOP if you've never done it before. This course took me about 6 weeks.

  
C175 Data Management Foundations - The first of three SQL classes. Honestly the data classes made me seriously consider a career in data engineering or management. SQL is fun and I had no idea what it was before. My biggest advice is to go through this textbook thoroughly even though you probably could pass the tests with a lot less effort. The more you take notes and learn the material, the easier the second and third SQL classes will be. This course took me another 6 weeks.

  
C170 Data Management Applications - So basically if you did a good job actually learning the textbook in C175, this class is way easier. There's a new textbook and you can go through it to learn some more advanced ideas about optimizing tables for performance and non-redundancy. This class has a project and the project (like almost all of the WGU CS projects) doesn't actually take that long to do. I think I actually only spend 3 weeks on this class, but only because I thoroughly studied SQL in the prior course. It'll probably take longer if you only skimmed the first data textbook.

  
D191 Advanced Data Management - People complain about this class because the training wheels disappear and there doesn't seem to be a lot of support. There's basically just a few documents explaining some advanced techniques like triggers and procedures (essentially they are function definitions in SQL with the ability to set auto update features to database tables). Then there's just a project. If you didn't really learn that much SQL in the first two classes and sort of half-assed it to this point, I imagine this class will be punishing because you don't know where to start. On the other hand, if you did a good job learning the material from the first two courses, this class is basically a weekend of coding. This class took me like 3 days. 1 day to read up about triggers and procedures, and the 2 days to code the project. It felt like it could have just been a part of the C170 class, but maybe they wanted to break it up a bit. By the way, none of these data projects are portfolio worthy. You're essentially just populating tables and then doing complicated queries linking tables together.

  
C176 Business of IT Project Management - I think this class no longer exists. I took this class before the CS program updated and replaced this class with the linux course. I opted to switch to the new program knowing that this class no longer counts towards degree completion. Anyways, this is the Project+ certification class. I kind of liked it and entertained the idea of being a project manager. You learn how project managers keep track of ongoing projects through different visual tools and how scheduling works. I found it decently useful to know how real life team collaboration might look like. The test for this isn't that easy though, so if you hate reading this stuff, it'll be a chore. I'd say it's a medium difficulty class for a test based class, just because there's a lot of specific things to know. Took me 2 weeks and I used an online program that someone suggested on this subreddit for most of it (something like CB nuggets or something that sounds like that).

  
C846 Business of IT Applications - Or is it this class that no longer exists? This is the ITIL 4 certification class. Boy oh boy this class is boring. You're just learning business terminology and it's eyerollingly dry. You just memorize a bunch of phrases like ""co-creating value with clientele"" and take a test to prove that you know how to sound like a soulless corporate suit having zoom meetings with stakeholders. I get that it's important to know how to speak to your managers, but by god this class was boring. I don't know maybe you'll like it and if you do, probably switch to an MBA or something. This class took me 2 weeks.

  
D194 IT Leadership Foundations - This is a one day class, no joke. You take a little personality test and then write a paper about your strengths and weaknesses as a leader. Boring, busy work. One thing that I noted was that the evaluators really care about how good your grammar and syntax is. They ultimately force Grammarly down your throat for this one, and honestly I had never used it before and I'll probably use it going forward. I thought I was already a decent writer. Turns out my syntax could be a lot better.

  
**Term 3 (Uh oh):**

  
C949 Data Structures and Algorithms I - I love this topic. This class introduces you to all of the building blocks that will allow you to learn leetcode and prepare for tech interviews. It doesn't get you all the way there, but it gives you all of the foundational knowledge. I bought a book called ""A Common Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms"" and read it fervently over the course of a week. It's a really cool topic. After reading that book, I skimmed over the textbook and did targeted practice problems. You could probably speed through this course since the test didn't feel that difficult, but honestly this is probably THE class to take seriously if you want to be a software engineer. I think I spent 2 months on it.

  
C960 Discrete Math II - Are you bad at math? If you are, this class might make you drop out entirely. HUGE difficulty spike here in terms of math abilities. I thought calc was a piece of cake and DM1 was a fun little experience. DM2 is the first class that made me go ""oh yeah, this is the difficulty of college classes that I remember from my first degree."" So much information and a lot of it is just hard to do. Probability made me start doubting my own math skills and I've always felt confident with math. It WAS interesting though. Learning how to do RSA by hand was cool and insightful and so was learning Bayesian probability. I don't blame people for saying that it's the hardest course in the program. I definitely can see how it will weed a LOT of people out from earning this degree. I spent a little more than 2 months on it.

  
C950 Data Structures and Algorithms II - My favorite class of the entire program. The project is a really cool one that you code from scratch using your own ideas. There's not a lot of new material that's required, but I went over the textbook anyways to learn about advanced data structures like red-black trees and specific algorithms like floyd-warshall and djikstra's. Basically the new material is REQUIRED to do the project, but the more tools you are aware of, the more creative you solution will be. If someone wanted to cheat themselves out of the experience, they can probably look at other student projects and base their solution off it. It turns out that the project constraints are a lot looser than you think (It's pretty easy to come up with a solution with lower mileage than they say), but I really enjoyed implementing my own solution. This project is portfolio worthy and the best part is that I would be prepared to talk at length about my problem solving strategy and how I built my solution, which is ultimately what projects are good for in interviews. The class took me 3 weeks to do. The first week was brainstorming, the second week was coding, and the third week was writing it up. It's a huge paper.



**Term 4:**

  
D197 Version Control - Kind of annoying if you've never used Git. I was taken aback at how complicated it felt doing all of this for the first time. Git is super important and while I understood the idea of version control, I couldn't help but think ""there's got to be a better way of doing this."" There really isn't, it just gets easier. Took me 1 week as there's not actually much to it. I probably should have done this a bit closer to the Java classes since you have to use git for those projects. Instead, I had to relearn a lot of this when I got to those classes.

  
C952 Computer Architecture - HAHAHA WOW this class is a beast. Imagine having to sit there and read a 400 page technical manual about how your CPU works. The material is DRY and sorry, there's no way around this class but to sit there and READ READ READ. If you try to shortcut out of this class, you'll fail that test miserably. Seriously, search this sub for this class and see how many people are begging for help and how many guides just say ""read the textbook."" There's an instructor video series that can cut down your time a LITTLE bit, but it's more of a guide to tell you which sections to read more carefully and which sections to skim. Guess what? It's still a TON of reading. This class is the closest this program will get to traditional ""low level"" classes where you're learning assembly (ARM). I wish it talked more about how different logic gates worked, but whatever I'm gonna take the pass and move on. I don't think I want to be a hardware engineer based on this class. This took me 1 month of heavy studying (actual 15 hours per week).

C191 Operating Systems - Basically the same experience as Computer Architecture. People will debate which class is harder and honestly it's close. Between the Computer Architecture class and this one, a lot of people will drop out of the program quietly because they're just such hard classes. Its hard both because there's so much material and also that the material is really hard to follow when you're reading it. So much detail and so much vocab on vocab on vocab. You need to know vocab just to get through each new section of reading. Reading these textbooks feel like reading another language at times. Just grind through it and know that once you finish these two courses, everything else will feel easier. Both these classes should have been split into two or more courses. This took me another month of heavy studying. The only good thing about these two courses is that since it's a straightforward ""read and take the test"" sort of class, it's easy to just schedule time every day to grind through the content. I find with some of the other classes with projects and papers, you might take longer just because you reach mental blocks where you need to find the motivation to do the next creative part. With these two classes it's just like ""I guess I'll read another 20 pages tonight.""

  
D281 Linux Foundations - WTF why didn't anyone warn me about this class. I thought it was going to be easy and then it turns out it's just a little easier than Computer Architecture and Operating Systems. You're basically reading the Linux manual, so it's really dry. There's not a lot of hands-on learning, so you're just trying to memorize a bunch of letters that represent shortcuts. For each linux command, you need to know what the optional arguments are and what they do. Seriously, its basically a flashcard class with a LOT of flashcards. There's a CISCO course that you can do, but essentially it's all the same. Memorize a bunch of letters and then take a linux certification test. This also took me a month.



D286 Java Fundamentals - If you take this after the other coding classes, then it's a joke. It's just basic programming again, but with Java. I literally went ""are you serious?"" and scheduled the test after 3 days of looking at the material. It's just like any programming languages with slightly different syntax for stuff like printing. The test is interesting because you actually have to code solutions from scratch. The test is identical to the 14 problems at the end of the textbook, so just make sure you know how to do those problems. Don't memorize, just know how to code the answers. The test is almost word for word identical. Just a few numbers and instructions are switched. The class took me 3 days.

  
D287 Java Frameworks - Okay if you actually have no real work experience and have never used a framework before, this class is a huge wake up call. I bought a book called ""Spring Start Here"" because people said it's better for beginners than the one in the course materials, and I agree. At least that book explains WHAT spring even IS and the basics of it. You only need to read half that book and then you can start your project. There are some decent guides on this sub for this class, but essentially you're learning how to write a springboot web app. The class feels very much like the training wheels are off and nobody is holding your hand, so this class can be very frustrating just trying to learn stuff yourself. The worse part is that you can't code the project from scratch. You have to use a lot of their starter code, so a lot of the project is just understanding what the existing code is doing and what you need to do to fix it and enhance it. I found this class more difficult than the DSA 2 project simply because at least with the DSA 2 project, the entire code file is mine and I knew how to build everything from scratch. This project feels like you're walking into spaghetti code and trying to make heads or tails of it without ever having seen this type of code. This took me 3 weeks.

  
D288 Backend Programming - This project is even WORSE than the frameworks project because you're forced to code this project inside of a virtual lab environment. This is because you have to code your project to connect to a front-end angular project (written in typescript I believe) and a SQL database that is loaded into the lab environment. You can't modify the angular project and the database, so you just have to take the existing java code and connect up all the pieces. This is a frustratingly tedious project because you're essentially going through all three parts (front-end, spring app, and database) with a fine-toothed comb making sure that every single variable name and endpoint is meticulously typed correctly. Any mistake and boom, it doesn't work. Because you're working with so much existing code that is hard to decipher, this project feels very overwhelming. In the end, I guess it's sort of cool to know that your code is part of what looks to be a real life (albeit ugly) web app. I think people caution against using these java projects in your portfolio because so much of it isn't your actual code or even good clean code. This took me 2 weeks of coding while wanting to pull my hairs out. There's not that much new information, so you can just get to work when you open up this class.

  
D387 Advanced Java - Why is this project ultimately easier than the other Java projects? The techniques themselves are more advanced for sure. You're basically messing around with multi-threaded code, but there's actually a lot less to do than the other projects. The project itself is weird. Why would anyone want their webapp to even have these functionalities. It's just sort of an excuse to get students introduced to using threads and seeing how race conditions work. This took me about a week to complete. You can just open up the project and get started.

  
**Then I went Super Saiyan:**

  
D284 Software Engineering - Piece of cake. You're just making stuff up and writing a project proposal. You can literally do it in a day. There's no new information to learn here really. You're just going through the motions of coming up with a solution for a client request. It's just a paper. Start the course and then start writing. You don't code anything, you just write the paperwork and answer things like ""How will you solve this problem?"" I did this in two days (5 hours total of nonstop writing).

  
D480 Software Design and Quality Assurance - Another piece of cake. A fake ticket comes in for a bug in an existing software. The bug seems like it's a really obvious fix, so you just write a paper about how you're gonna fix it. Another 1-2 day class. Just open up the class and start writing. I did this in another two days (5 hours total of nonstop writing).

  
C951 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence - I spent time on this class because I am particularly interested in AI and always have been, even before this ChatGPT stuff. A lot of this class actually isn't about the modern AI stuff that you're probably thinking about, like generative AI and neural networks. They do talk about that near the end of the textbook, but most of it is old school AI techniques (which are still very relevant). There's three projects total. The first project is a chatbot (not ChatGPT style, think more like old school hard coded bots) and that takes maybe a day or two after learning about AIML (the markup language, not like AI/ML). The second project is kind of annoying because you're working with what seems to be software from two decades ago. You have to follow a tutorial to build this 3d model of a robot and add sensors to it. There's some coding, but it's done in Lua, which is like python. You don't really need to learn the language thoroughly, just enough to script some behavior. Most of the time will be spent clicking around this glitchy software and then writing up the paper. You can do the second project in about 3-4 days. The third project is basically a big proposal sort of like the Software Engineering class. That's a very long paper, but at least you can just start writing it. It'll take you about 3-4 days to write. However, I spent about 2 weeks just reading the textbook because I liked the topic. You learn a lot about machine learning algorithms that are used in forecasting and all sorts of applications. The textbook gets REALLY technical very quickly, so I got lost eventually in the math and focused more on the concepts of what these algorithms are trying to do. It makes the capstone project a lot easier to navigate since you know what you're doing. In all, I took 3 weeks for this class even though if you only did the projects, it'll take you maybe 1 week and a half. You might pay for that during the capstone though.



**I asked for a one month extension on my final term:**

C964 Computer Science Capstone - This project is portfolio worthy in my opinion. It's what you make of it, but either way, you're asked to apply a machine learning solution to any sort of problem you want. You have to actually code it though unlike the AI writeups and present it somehow. I just learned how to use Jupyter and how to create widgets in the notebook. The first part of the project is basically a data analysis project, similar to what the data science people would do. You take a Kaggle dataset and analyze and clean the data. Then you use the cleaned data to train a machine learning model by splitting it up into a training set and testing set. Essentially machine learning algos are ways for the computer to figure out ""hidden patterns"" in data. So the training set helps the algo search for a technique on how to match inputs and outputs. Then you can use the test set to test how well it does for new data points. Then you have to take this model and present it such that a user could create a new data point on the fly and get a prediction. This project went into my portfoilio. I spent about 3 weeks total on this: one week brainstorming, one week coding, and one week writing.

  
Anyways that's it. I got tired of typing all of this so I skimped on the details, but if you have any questions, ask!"

1ehiqa5,17,2024-08-01,How I studied enough to feel confident walking out of the exam room while being in residency and only using flashcards!,u/snwobelaC,NAPLEX_Prep,https://www.reddit.com/r/NAPLEX_Prep/comments/1ehiqa5/how_i_studied_enough_to_feel_confident_walking/,"Hi everyone! I just got my exam results today and figured I’d add to the plethora of examination tips as I felt finding a situation similar to mine helped ease my stress and improved my confidence.

**Before I begin**: the second half of my studying was during full time residency, which I advise you NOT to do – please take your exams before you start – it was a horrible experience.

**Background**: I am **~NOT~** a student that can read something a few times and remember it, I have to put in a lot of work before something sticks with me – my #1 method for studying is flashcards… that’s it! No writing, reading or highlighting (does not work for me)

**Resources**: RxPrep book + RxPrep question bank

**My methods**: I use spaced repetition/flashcards for the ENTIRE exam (made an Anki of 4,000 + notecards from every single chapter in the RxPrep book + made paper flashcards for things I felt were key topics and B/G) and studied almost daily for 3ish months.

1.        I tried to do at least one chapter a day during the week and 2-3 small chapters on the weekends or 1 big chapter.

2.       After learning the new chapters listed above, I would re-study the flashcards for the last 3 learned topics – so 4 sets on weekdays (1 new and 3 old) and 4-6 on weekends (1-3 new and 3 old) – this helped me solidify the past chapters so they weren’t lost a week later.

3.       At the beginning and end of every day, I would do 20 questions from the test bank for all of the chapters I studied

4.       Pneumonics – For everything!

**MATH**: Math is a very important topic for the exam – it can make or break your pass. For me, I did math daily until I felt comfortable with it, then would do practice questions on RxPrep test bank every other day to make sure I had time for my flashcards.

**ChatGPT**: I see lots of questions about “how do I memorize Y” or “what pneumonic do you use for X”. I used ChatGPT for all of my pneumonics – it can give you basically an unlimited number of options until you find one that works best for you. It can also help you solidify questions such as “why does X drug cause Y effect”.

**Options for Practice:** I utilized the Pre-Naplex a week prior to the exam – I felt that it was less about being prepared and more about seeing how questions are written and practice on what to look for.

**Approaching the exam**: I have a reply here that shows how I approached the exam questions [https://www.reddit.com/r/NAPLEX\_Prep/comments/1e7q1zw/comment/le3bnf6/](https://www.reddit.com/r/NAPLEX_Prep/comments/1e7q1zw/comment/le3bnf6/)

1.       Please use the break that you are given during the exam, it will be really nice to have a little 10-minute brain reset and to use the bathroom

**My Exam:** Like I said, I studied the entire book – and I felt like 60 of the 80 topics were not even on my exam – so don’t skip anything, that could be the topic you get 10 questions on even though it’s only 2 pages in the RxPrep book

If anyone has any other questions for me or would like any other advice, feel free to comment it below or DM me – I did not want to make this a super extensive post, I tried to keep it very baseline.

Good luck everyone and congrats to those who have passed."
1ehk0sm,43,2024-08-01,Finally done with Windows!,u/Joey6543210,linuxmint,https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxmint/comments/1ehk0sm/finally_done_with_windows/,"TL:DR - today is the day I finally say good-bye to windows at my work desktop! I found workarounds for all my needs of a windows virtual machine.

Bit a long story. I'm a faculty member that does computational research, so I have been tinkering with Linux Mint since 2016. I'm more of an experienced user than a power user because my use case mainly involves Google Chrome and Dropbox outside of the computational software I use. I have a high performance workstation (acquired in 2016) that runs Linux Mint but my main work desktop is still Windows. Because my main desktop was purchased using a research grant in 2012, I have total control of the hardware.

However, that has always been a contentious point between IT and myself because I also need total control of the software environment and IT does like that (or can't allow that) that I need admin access to Windows. Since I acquired my workstation in 2016, the main desktop has been shifted to more of an office computer than a computational machine, which is kinda a shame because it has an old i7 CPU and 24GB ram.

Fast forward to 2020, the desktop hard drive finally gave out after years of using (or abusing, lots of data write/rewrite due to the computational process), and I needed a replacement. The dean was kind enough to give me a small budget that I put an SSD in there (still typing on that computer right now), but IT refused to give me a windows installation disc (drive) at that time. After some argument, I was like, the heck with that. I put Linux Mint on the desktop and have been using it ever since.

However, there were some Windows specific tasks I need to do. Some other IT dude that I'm in good terms with (and he left already) gave me a windows laptop. Over the next year or so, I realized the main reason I use the windows laptop was to print something. After IT helped me with setting up my phone for printing, I returned the laptop.

Then I also found out other tasks I needed a windows computer. For one, there is no native Google Drive client for Linux, and I didn't want to use a third-party client with my employee credentials. The other is the support for MS office, specifically PowerPoint, because there is a poster file that needs a special PowerPoint template. The third reason is to preview the file before uploading. It would be disastrous if I upload the wrong student exam into the Learning Management system!

So I endured the windows virtual machine, even found hacks to install Windows 11 on Virtual box 6, and update the windows VM religiously, probably more religiously because I update the machine more frequently than I actually prayed. All was good until this May. The VM would NOT UPDATE for some stupid reason. I tried all kinds of fixes suggested by Google and ChatGPT and eventually I realized, I don't want the headache anymore!

So what did I do with my needs? Now I use Gnome online accounts for Google Drive. It's not as convenient as native Google Drive client because the constant needs to copy/paste files to and from Google Drive, but at least I have access to Google Drive from the file manager. I also found out the office online now does a decent job (not the case a few years back) for opening large, non-standard ppt files. As for preview before uploading, I don't have a good solution but to manually open the file to make sure it's the correct one before uploading, but that's the small price I'm willing to pay to be rid of Windows completely. 

Side note: my kids have two windows gaming laptops I maintain at home, grrr"
1ei11nq,3,2024-08-02,Anxious about next semester? Here’s How to Make It Fun and Effective! 🎉,u/founder_of_penseum,study,https://www.reddit.com/r/study/comments/1ei11nq/anxious_about_next_semester_heres_how_to_make_it/,"  
Gearing up for the next semester and wanna make a real difference, here’s the scoop from a fellow student who’s not lost his sanity (yet)  
  
**Know Your Why**: Studying without a goal is like wandering in the desert without water. Aim for that 4.0 GPA, or at least not falling asleep in lectures. Goals, people!

**Play Favorites**: All assignments aren’t created equal. Some are like gold, others like dust. Focus on the big fish that’ll boost your learning and grades. 🎯

**Tiny Bites**: Got a mammoth task? Slice it like pizza. More slices = more yum. Plan it out. You can't devour an XL pizza in one sitting, right? 🍕✂️

**Get Involved**: Don’t just read; chat, debate, or pretend you’re on a quiz show. Rubber duck method, baby. Teach someone, even if it’s your dog. 🦆

**Be the Clock’s BFF**: Pick study hours and stick to them like glue on glitter. Pomodoro technique is the secret sauce. ⏰🍅

**Brains Need TLC**: Sleep, snack smart, move a bit. Treat your brain like the royalty it is. 🛌🥑🏋️‍♂️

**Tech-Up**: Use tools like Perplexity, ChatGPT, [~Penseum~](https://www.penseum.com/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=post), etc., to pimp your study setup. 🚀📱

**Class Isn’t Just Attendance**: Show up, ask questions, act like Sherlock. 🕵️‍♂️🔍

**Study Squads**: Team up. Two heads (or more) are better than one and way more fun! 👯‍♂️

**Ask, Don’t Stash**: Stuck? Shout out. Professors, mates, the uni cat – someone knows the answer. 🙋‍♀️🐱

Remember, every setback’s just a setup for a comeback. Let’s crush this semester together! Hope this helps! 🎓🚀

Feel free to add your own tips and share the love. Let’s ace this! 💪💥"
1ei6el6,1,2024-08-02,"Need some clarification in bringing my cats to Germany, specifically Pet Passport and Import Permit.",u/RAyLV,germany,https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/1ei6el6/need_some_clarification_in_bringing_my_cats_to/,"I have been living here in NRW as a student. I am not living in a student dorm, and have already talked about a possibility of bringing my cats when I moved in, and they've assured that it's not a problem.

A bit of a background:    

I have [two cats](https://imgur.com/a/nqmEN1x) in Pakistan. I wasn't planning to bring them here when I moved in for my studies, mainly because they're also adored by my parents and were in a very loving environment. However, very recently, a newest member of the family, my nephew, arrived, and he started having breathing problems because of the cats. After getting second opinions from doctors, and discussing any other possible workarounds, it was decided that the cats needed to be moved out. I was devastated upon hearing this, I felt helpless as there wasn't much I can do while being so far away from them. 

We didn't have a lot of options, it was either to give the cats for adoption or give them to a shelter. No one was happy with these options. We still hesitantly went for the adoption route, and received no positive response. I understand that my cats were strays, and now they're 7 years old \[may develop health issues soon\], so it seemed that the chances of getting them adopted into a loving home is minimal. I don't want to put them in a shelter, I want to give them a good life. So now I am planning to bring them here with me.

Now:      
  
After reading up about bringing pets to Germany and traveling with pets, these are the requirements  I found that need to fulfilled before traveling/entering Germany, based on some reference: \[[reference1](https://www.simplegermany.com/moving-to-germany-with-pets/), [reference2](https://www.pettravel.com/immigration/Germany.cfm)\]

1. Microchip: ISO 11784/11785
2. Rabies Vaccination (after microchipping) (wait 30 days)
3. Documentation:
   1. Health Certificate (within 5 days of travel) 
   2. Pet Passport 
   3. Import Permit
4. Check requirements for the specific Airline (I am looking currently into Turkish Airlines)

  
I am already working on the first two as I have discussed these with my vet in Pakistan. I am more concerned about the point 3.2. Pet Passport, I learned about it when I contacted Turkish Airlines for information, they mentioned that it is required for the pet to enter Germany. I am not aware if Pet Passport can be issued in Pakistan, is there any possibility that I can issue a Pet Passport right here Germany even before the arrive? (I doubt it, but still wanted to ask). 

And I recently learned about the ""Import Permit"" - Point 3.3. from ChatGPT, but it mentions that it is optional. I couldn't find much about it right now except that is a document issued by Germany to grant permission for the pet to be imported.

  
Since I don't know or have any experience regarding this situation at all, any clarification, suggestions, or note on things that I am missing, would be really appreciated thank you! "
1ei6to0,1,2024-08-02,ULPT Request - ChatGPT to help writing text for a master’s thesis,u/Shurets,UnethicalLifeProTips,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnethicalLifeProTips/comments/1ei6to0/ulpt_request_chatgpt_to_help_writing_text_for_a/,"Hey everyone!

I am a foreign student on my fourth year of two year Master’s program struggling to finish my degree in Europe. I was diagnosed with adhd but unfortunately here nobody really cares about this disability. I’ve got covered to some extent with medication and I am also in a therapy but that is not enough.

After managing to finish my last most difficult exam in February which I was postponing for three years, I’ve continued to be frozen unable to start writing my thesis. My advising professor is not really helping mostly just ignoring my questions.

In June after a lot of pressure from my family I was able to start the work. I managed to find a nice book on my topic and a dozen of articles for my literature review. I also used ChatGPT to get some ideas on hypothesis and preliminary research. I made a quite detailed table of contents for my work and decided on what to have in a “practical” part of the work. Basically I am doing a descriptive thesis with some easy case studies. It was approved by my professor and he agreed to let me write something simple to just get a passable grade, nothing fancy.

So, currently I have some articles for the start, a nice book and some industry reports but I am struggling to start writing text and I need some tips how ChatGPT (I got the paid version) could help me write as much relevant text as possible. I need to write around 80 pages and I’ve got 59 days until the deadline.

I am not really going to blatantly steal others’ work and I am going to properly quote everything mentioning everything in the bibliography. I am willing to rewrite generated text correcting and  paraphrasing where necessary. Nobody would really care about my work and read it under a magnifying glass so I am willing to take some risk. I will also be running the text through paid plagiarism checker which is used by my university to make sure it doesn’t detect any plagiarism and AI  written text.

If someone also got something more tricky and cunning that could help me but that may be considered forbidden to write here, please PM me

P.S. I know it is borderline grey zone but all I ask is some tips to get over education thing which is already stretching over 10+ years instead of 5 for bachelor+masters."
1ei972p,1,2024-08-02,Aggregation Query result is null. Can someone help?,u/Bitter_General5483,mongodb,https://www.reddit.com/r/mongodb/comments/1ei972p/aggregation_query_result_is_null_can_someone_help/,"I was following [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWmMvudBgFU&list=PLA3GkZPtsafZydhN4nP0h7hw7PQuLsBv1&index=29) and learning aggregation pipeline at 31:00 he shares a query for finding average of score but does not show the output and when I tried the same query,

  db.students.aggregate(\[{$group:{\_id:null,avgS:{$avg:{$filter:{input:""$scores"",as:""score"",cond:{$gt:\[""$score"",12\]}}}}}}\])

 my output was : \[ { \_id: null, avgS: null } \]

what could be wrong here. And this is what Chatgpt says ""The problem with your query is that the $filter operator is being used in a way that doesn't make sense for calculating the average of the scores for students older than 12. Specifically:  
  
Incorrect Use of $filter: The $filter operator is intended to filter elements within an array, but you are using it to compare age, which is not an array element.  
Invalid Condition: The condition {$gt:\[""$age"",12\]} inside $filter is intended to filter array elements based on a property of the array elements themselves, but age is a top-level document field, not a property within the scores array.""

1eidmw1,18,2024-08-02,Sister signs and axis,u/novaleenationstate,astrologymemes,https://www.reddit.com/r/astrologymemes/comments/1eidmw1/sister_signs_and_axis/,"I find the connection between sister signs fascinating and recently discovered that they’re said to exist along a certain axis, and despite how different they seem, they have a certain theme or vibe in common. Apparently it goes:

Aries (fire) // Libra (air): The Axis of Identity (representing the 1H and 7H house, the struggle between the self and relationships) 

Taurus (earth) // Scorpio (water): The Axis of Possession (covers the 2H and 8H, representing the pursuit of material and spiritual possession and elimination, learning what to value and what to let go of) 

Gemini (air) // Sagittarius (fire): The Axis of Information (represents 3H and 9H, the tension between logic vs philosophy, but mutually share in the pursuit of knowledge. One is typically the student—Gemini—while the other is teacher) 

Cancer (water) // Capricorn (earth): The Axis of Security (exists along the 4H and 10H, a tension between domestic security and needing to venture outside the home to gain that success. Also, both seek security but in different forms—emotional security for Cancers, material security for Caps. Also literally embodies mom—Cancer—and dad—Cap—energy) 

Leo (fire) // Aquarius (air): The Axis of Ego  (covers the 5H and 11H; both have a strong, singular sense of character and drive, the axis represents the tension between the ego serving the self versus the collective; also suggests a clash of heart—Leo—and mind, and needing to balance the two) 

Virgo (earth) // Pisces (water): The Axis of Service (covers the 6H and 12H, representing the clash between Virgo’s rational, analytical mind and Pisces more intuitive, imaginative way of thinking. Both are kindly and compassionate; one side could learn to soften up though and balance reason with compassion to the self and perhaps spirituality, while the other can learn from Virgo’s example to create order) 

Do these resonate for you? Do you feel close to your sister sign or is there tension? "

I work as a server at a hotel for events such as weddings, birthday parties, business retreats. I love it and I hate it, the pay is why I’m still there. 

I love listening to music, my favorite genres are rap, r&b, and alternative rock. I love to journal. I love pretty much anything art in general, traveling, learning new things, basketball and going out. Also play video games, but I haven’t had much time lately. I’m pretty much a pothead so I hope you’d be fine with that lmao. I feel like I can get along with anyone as long as you can put effort into the conversation lol. 

I’d appreciate if you tell me a bit about yourself once you message. I’m cool with moving onto a different platform later on."

1eiv1o8,67,2024-08-03,Weekend Thread #4: LinkedIn-ing Yourself,u/No_Guarantee9023,Btechtards,https://www.reddit.com/r/Btechtards/comments/1eiv1o8/weekend_thread_4_linkedining_yourself/,"In case you missed the previous three weekend threads, [here they are](https://www.reddit.com/r/Btechtards/?f=flair_name%3A%22Weekend%20Threads%20%3AMod%3A%22). I tried to cover Mechanical and Electrical in them. If you wish to contribute to some other helpful content for future threads, please DM!

I'll try covering some basics on how you can navigate LinkedIn, focusing on profile, connections and cold messaging. I will not cover content creation here, but you're free to discuss anything in the comments.

* Follow this resource thoroughly: [https://careered.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj22801/files/media/file/linkedin-profile-checklist.pdf](https://careered.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj22801/files/media/file/linkedin-profile-checklist.pdf)
* Be thorough with everything. Add all your projects, experiences, education, etc. Add a good summary.
* Remember to be PROFESSIONAL. This means
   * No Instagram pics, no pics of anime or Avengers characters. Use a professional headshot of yourself.
   * No GenZ language.
* Don't add words like ""hustler"", ""hardworking"", ""XYZ enthusiast"" in your headline or summary. These don't help, they're just cringe.
* Headline: For students, you could put in degree, college, year of graduation, past intern company, 1-2 words that highlights your specialization/field of interest, etc. Use | to separate them. Keep it simple, don't clog it with everything, then no one will read it. For example, ""ML | Manipal EEE '26"" is short, simple, good. ""PM Intern @ X | Research @ IIT-X"" is also a good headline. ""B2B SaaS Enthusiast || ML Enthusiast || AI || Campus Ambassador @ IIT Bombay || Hustler || Entrepreneur || Retail Investor || Aspiring Engineer || SRK Fan"" isn't.
* You may or may not include school stuff. It's useful for 1st/2nd yrs who may not have anything else to put in their profile, but later your goal should be to slowly phase them off with better stuff.
* On your profile page (Desktop), there is a ""Public profile & URL"" edit button. Edit your LinkedIn URL. linkedin.com/in/firstname\_lastname looks so much better than linkedin.com/in/firstnamelastname-8d7sd9fgd. It's also easier to put on your resume.
* Education: Add your club/activity, relevant coursework, etc. under your college name and degree.
* Test scores: Only add your entrance exam ranks if they are good enough. Don't add which coaching you go to.
* Spelling mistakes: Use Grammarly plugin for all text boxes.
* Link your portfolio. Before that, make a portfolio. I could make a new weekend thread on this too.
* Pro tip: If you want to avoid mentioning your CG or degree name for various reasons, no need to mention them. Just add your college name with ""BTech"" as the degree name in the Education section. 



Now coming onto the fun part:

* Build up your connections first by sending requests to batchmates, juniors, seniors, alumni of your college, etc.
* Use LinkedIn for searching and friendly profile viewing. Search for recent grads or professionals who are doing well and in areas you aspire to be in. See what they did in their college life, send them connection requests, follow up and ask further. People love to give gyaan especially when it boosts their self-esteem. 
* Cold messaging: Please DO NOT use the AI features or use ChatGPT to send cold messages. Also, do not small talk. People are too busy to respond to ""Hi how are you hope you're doing well"". The number of people I know way too many people (including myself) who get irritated by small talk DMs on LinkedIn. Be frank and upfront - ask your doubts clearly, message why you're reaching out. But don't put a ton of text. It's ok if they don't respond - give a follow-up later but don't nag them too much. Also, do not use the autofill/suggestions.
* Cold messaging success rates increase if you have something in common with the other person - could be the same school, same college, similar paths when they were at your level, ex-interns at the same place, etc.
* Searching for people:
   * Use keywords. For example, if you want to find someone in CMU studying robotics, search for ""undergrad\_name Carnegie robotics"". 
   * Use filters in the ""people"" section of the company. For example, if you want to find people in McKinsey who studied mechanical engineering, go to the company's LinkedIn page -> People -> What they studied -> Mechanical Engineering. This is a pretty powerful (and recommended tool).

  
Public Service Announcements:

* Do not take posts and the whole ""social media"" aspect of LinkedIn too seriously. Do not get FOMO, and don't blindly copy others. Take advice and suggestions, but sort them based on how you see fit for yourself.
* If you're ever feeling low, r/LinkedInLunatics is your go-to place for good content.
* All those posts giving out resources when you comment ""interested"" are usually not that helpful (may or may not be scams). They're meant to increase engagement for influencers. If they really were helpful enough, they would have just linked the resource directly.
* Can you get a job after doing all of this? Maybe, maybe not. End of disclaimer.

  
For some of you, this might be too beginner-level. If you have any other tips, do share them. For most of you, please follow them. I still receive many connection requests from ""Tony Stark"" with an SRK dp, or DMs with ""Hi"". 

Finally, if you wish to get your profile reviewed, drop your links below and I'll check them out. If you wish to stay anonymous, you can DM as well. If you also have suggestions for future weekend thread content for this sub, drop your suggestions. "

I am Rohan, CTO and cofounder of [TuneAI](https://tunehq.ai/). My tech journey began at 14 with the ridiculously ambitious goal of creating my own operating system. I spent countless hours learning Linux, C++, Java, kernel programming, and networking, building my own prototypes along the way.

By college, I co-founded Next Tech Lab and won many hackathons (in India and US), including the Reality Virtually Hackathon at MIT. My research at Harvard Medical School on deep learning in medical fields has been widely published and cited (over 400 times!).

This experience laid the foundation for my next venture - co-founding Tune AI, a cloud-based development environment that's democratizing access to large-language models. At Tune AI, we're building a platform that enables developers to build, deploy, and manage their own AI models without requiring extensive infrastructure or expertise. Our hosted LLMs offering has already attracted over 400k users (used by students and researchers to startups and enterprises), and our developer offerings are seeing impressive traction. My goal is to empower the next generation of AI innovators and help them bring their ideas to life.

Throughout my journey, I've been driven by a passion for innovation, collaboration, and making AI more accessible to everyone.

[Here is my X post](https://x.com/rohan_pooniwala/status/1819621031222419934) for proof :)

I'd love to chat about all things AI, machine learning, and startups - from building, deploying, and utilizing large language models in production to navigating the challenges of creating a deep tech product from India. Let's also talk about how AI is shaping the future for India and the world!

Ask me anything!

------------

Update: I am stepping out for lunch, I will try to reply to all the questions here for next couple of days
It was lovely talking to you all, I love this community.

You guys are amazing ❤️❤️

Update 2: Also if I haven't answered you, either I need to think a bit before I do, or I have already answered. 
But once I am back, I will try to reply to everyone :)"

Data Science grad student here, looking for some ideas for my capstone project. I'm aiming to work on something in the LLM space that combines both research and implementation. The project will span my final semester, so I've got a decent chunk of time to dive deep.

Some quick details:

* Timeline: One semester (about 3-4 months)
* Focus: Large Language Models
* Goal: Balance between research and practical implementation

I'm pretty comfortable with the usual ML/DL stack, but I'm open to learning new tools if needed.

Any suggestions for interesting problems or areas to explore?

If you've come across any cool papers or projects lately that could be extended, I'd love to hear about those too.

Thanks in advance for any input!"

1ejt067,1,2024-08-04,Are y'all using AI to learn faster?,u/Desperate_Parking985,ucr,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucr/comments/1ejt067/are_yall_using_ai_to_learn_faster/,"Hey y'all! This is an ex-bcoe student. I'm kinda jealous that the current students get to experience university in the world AI. I was class of 2018 and we didn't have any AI. I can just imagine how easy academics would have been if I had GPT back then. 

To that end, I still learn a lot in my career as a tech entrepreneur. I built this app called [learnbrain.ai](http://learnbrain.ai) which is specifically designed to learn anything much faster (scenarios like you have test tomorrow, need to learn as much as possible before the night). Normally, if you use ChatGPT or Claude or Perplexity, you get a single threaded conversation in a window. Such single-threaded conversations don't necessarily allows to deep dive into a particular topic. 

Learnbrain allow us to have an infinite canvas where each node is a conversations with latest Pro model AI of your choice (GPT / Claude). You can go into rabbit holes about your class subjects / research and have everything on a single canvas; no context switching. 

Moreover, you can create branches from a conversation to derive context from the souce conversation -- this will help the AI remember the original context much better, which in case of single threaded conversations is bad as the AI tends to forget the original point after a while. 

It's free to try, and if anyone of you wants a Pro subscription, DM me for a alumni discount :)

1eju9x1,78,2024-08-04,Less reading/requirements these days?,u/PatientSector583,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1eju9x1/less_readingrequirements_these_days/,"This is for all of you who teach English or other reading based courses. Compared to say, 20 years ago if you remember or can go back that far, do you think there is less reading now required in college courses? Aside from the tech factor, what are some of the biggest differences you notice between course requirements now and back then? 

I teach Math courses as an adjunct since I also have another job, but I love teaching on the side and have been doing this for more than 15 years. One thing I have noticed is that a lot of the teaching has gotten to the point (speaking only for Math as I do not know what's happening in other courses to compare) where there is rampant cheating. Students just plug in the problem on AI and even students who would normally get an F, are now getting perfect scores on hw assignments if they use some program like ALEKS or Cengage. I am growing frustrated with this because I have a feeling that more and more of this is becoming pointless....like why teach complex procedures if you can just plug it into Chatgpt and solve? Chatgpt is getting better and better at even pretty ""tough"" Math word problems, unfortunately. Anyway I digress...I'd be curious to read your thoughts. "
1ejv7ml,1,2024-08-04,LaTeXGPT: Compile ChatGPT's LaTeX Code in Chat Interface and Get PDFs,u/ninbit,LaTeX,https://www.reddit.com/r/LaTeX/comments/1ejv7ml/latexgpt_compile_chatgpts_latex_code_in_chat/,"I’ve been extensively using ChatGPT and other AI platforms to generate LaTeX code, but encountered some significant challenges. One of the main issues was the tedious process of copying and pasting the generated LaTeX code into a separate editor just to compile and view the results. This not only disrupted my workflow but also consumed a lot of time. Additionally, the built-in KaTeX renderer often failed to fully and accurately render complex LaTeX formulas, causing further headaches.

To address these challenges, I developed a browser extension called **LaTeXGPT**. This extension aims to streamline the LaTeX compilation process, making it more efficient and convenient directly within your browser.

# Key Features:

* **Instant Compilation:** A ""Compile"" button is automatically added to LaTeX code blocks on any website. With a single click, you can generate PDF or HTML outputs instantly.
* **Comprehensive LaTeX Support:** Utilizes a server-side solution to ensure accurate and complete rendering of LaTeX, unlike basic JavaScript libraries.
* **Seamless Integration:** Edit and compile LaTeX code without leaving your current site. Ideal for use with ChatGPT, Gemini, or any other AI platform that generates LaTeX code.
* **Flexible Viewing Options:** Open your compiled documents in a new tab for a full-screen, distraction-free experience.
* **Customizable Plugin Activity:** Choose which websites the plugin is active on, providing tailored functionality based on your needs.
* **Easy Code Entry:** Paste LaTeX code directly into the extension’s interface to compile it.

# Why LaTeXGPT?

LaTeXGPT was created to eliminate the hassle of switching between AI platforms and LaTeX editors. It saves time and effort, making it ideal for students, educators, researchers, and professionals who frequently work with LaTeX.

# Use Cases:

For instance, if you’re a math teacher preparing a test on derivatives, you can use ChatGPT to generate the LaTeX code for the questions and then use LaTeXGPT to compile it into a neatly formatted PDF. Similarly, if you’re a researcher working on a paper, you can quickly compile your equations and references directly within your browser. This extension is also perfect for students who need to submit homework or projects with properly formatted LaTeX code.

# How It Can Help You:

Whenever you have LaTeX-related questions, ask ChatGPT and then use LaTeXGPT to instantly verify the generated code. This allows you to quickly check AI-generated answers without needing additional tools or steps.

# You can install LaTeXGPT extension from [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/latexgpt-compile-latex-fr/fhfgcfmkpjonhniedbfcojhbkigemlbe?hl=tr&authuser=0).

I’d love to hear your feedback and suggestions. Your input is invaluable in helping improve LaTeXGPT. Feel free to ask questions, share your experiences, and let me know how LaTeXGPT is enhancing your LaTeX workflow.

Looking forward to your comments and thoughts!"
1ejx5qa,128,2024-08-04,WSJ:  There’s a Tool to Catch Students Cheating With ChatGPT. OpenAI Hasn’t Released It.,u/anxman,singularity,https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1ejx5qa/wsj_theres_a_tool_to_catch_students_cheating_with/,"[https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openai-tool-chatgpt-cheating-writing-135b755a](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openai-tool-chatgpt-cheating-writing-135b755a)

Hi folks, longtime lurker / never poster.  I felt like this would be important for this audience.  I realize it's behind a paywall so I'm hoping someone can help post a ""full"" article.  I'm going to quote some of the parts that stood out to me regarding AI safety:

---

""OpenAI has a method to reliably detect when someone uses ChatGPT to write an essay or research paper. The company hasn’t released it despite widespread concerns about students [using artificial intelligence to cheat](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/teachers-ai-classroom-schools-678d7d84?mod=article_inline)**.** 

The project has been mired in internal debate at OpenAI for roughly two years and has been ready to be released for about a year, according to people familiar with the matter and internal documents viewed by The Wall Street Journal. “It’s just a matter of pressing a button,” one of the people said.

In trying to decide what to do, OpenAI employees have wavered between the startup’s stated commitment to transparency and their desire [to attract and retain users](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/chatgpt-maker-goes-smaller-and-cheaper-with-new-ai-tech-0cbcff84?mod=article_inline). One survey the company conducted of loyal ChatGPT users found nearly a third would be turned off by the anticheating technology.

An OpenAI spokeswoman said the company is concerned the tool could disproportionately affect groups such as non-native English speakers. “The text watermarking method we’re developing is technically promising but has important risks we’re weighing while we research alternatives,” she said. “We believe the deliberate approach we’ve taken is necessary given the complexities involved and its likely impact on the broader ecosystem beyond OpenAI.”

Employees who support the tool’s release, including those who helped develop it, have said internally those arguments pale compared with the good such technology could do. ""

""ChatGPT is powered by an AI system that predicts what word or word fragment, known as a token, should come next in a sentence. The anticheating tool under discussion at OpenAI would slightly change how the tokens are selected. Those changes would leave a pattern called a watermark. 

The watermarks would be unnoticeable to the human eye but could be found with OpenAI’s detection technology. The detector provides a score of how likely the entire document or a portion of it was written by ChatGPT. 

The watermarks are 99.9% effective when enough new text is created by ChatGPT, according to the internal documents. ""

"" ... **OpenAI surveyed ChatGPT users and found 69% believe cheating detection technology would lead to false accusations of using AI. Nearly 30% said they would use ChatGPT less if it deployed watermarks and a rival didn’t.**

**A recurring internal concern has been that the anticheating tool could hurt the quality of ChatGPT’s writing. OpenAI conducted a test earlier this year that found watermarking didn’t impair ChatGPT’s performance, people familiar with the matter said.**

**“Our ability to defend our lack of text watermarking is weak now that we know it doesn’t degrade outputs,” employees involved in the testing concluded, according to the internal documents.** 

In early June, OpenAI senior employees and researchers met again to discuss the project. The group agreed the watermarking technology worked well, but the results of the ChatGPT user survey from last year still loomed large. Staffers said the company should look into other approaches that were potentially less controversial among users but unproven, according to people with knowledge of the meeting.

They also said OpenAI needed a plan by this fall to sway public opinion around AI transparency as well as potential new laws on the subject, the internal documents show. 

“Without this, we risk credibility as responsible actors,” a summary of the June meeting said."""

I have been building my own FlutterFlow agency (with only myself) and have gotten 2 clients so far. It is my primary school and my local community Centre. Essentially I specialize in building Mobile Apps for schools and community centers which helps them communicate with their members and send updates regarding events. However, since these were my first clients, I am not getting paid much. So I wanted to design a summer workshop where i teach people about App Development (using FF) and Supabase. And here are somethings I wanted to ask for help.

**1. What demographic should I focus on?** I was planning to target High School Students who can create these apps to put on their college applications or resumes. I was thinking of targeting University Students with a similar selling point. On the other hand, I was thinking of keeping it open to anyone who wants to build an app of their own.

**2. What would be a great project / app idea to build with beginners?** Essentially I was aiming to make the course project based. I want to teach them basics while helping them build an app that they can use. I was thinking of building like a Family App to make grocery list, plan events or put updates. But thought this might become complex. I was also thinking of maybe just building an app that wraps Gemini as an AI app based project. Essentially I want to make something valuable with the students so they can be proud of what they have made. I didn't want to do the To Do List app because there are tons of videos online about that.

**3. How long should the entire course be?** I was planning to have synchronous classes live online. And was planning each class to be about 2 hrs. I was planning to make the course have 6 classes in total so (12hrs of teaching). Is this sufficient to teach them basic to intermediate level of FF App Dev and have a project ready for them?

**4. How much should I price the course?** The big question. I was planning to charge about $99/student. They would get 12 hrs of live lectures and have the opportunity to book extra QA sessions (like office hours) if they have any confusion with that price. Again, I want to help them build something of value and have fun.

**5 Anything else?** Is there anything else I must be careful of? I am new to designing a course, but I am well versed with FlutterFlow. Is there any other input anyone has?

Thank you!"

I was planning to make the course have 6 classes in total so (12hrs of teaching). Maybe the length of the course would also depend on the the project and demographic. But I want to finish the course within August.

**4. How much should I price the course?** The big question. I was planning to charge about $99/student. They would get 12 hrs of live lectures and have the opportunity to book extra QA sessions (like office hours) if they have any confusion with that price. Again, I want to help them build something of value and have fun.

**5. If I were to market the course, where would be greate spot?** Also what would be a great way to market the course? Flyers, or FB ads or something else?

**5 Anything else?** Is there anything else I must be careful of? I am new to designing a course and teaching it myself online, but I am well versed with App Development and public speaking. Is there any other input anyone has?

Thank you!"
1ek7utr,2,2024-08-04,Teaching an App Development Course - Advice Needed,u/Brilliant-Thought864,AskProgramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/1ek7utr/teaching_an_app_development_course_advice_needed/,"Hi everyone. I have been building my Software agency (with only myself) and have gotten 2 clients so far. It is my primary school and my a local community Centre in milton. Essentially I specialize in building Mobile Apps for schools and community centers which helps them communicate with their members and send updates regarding events. However, since these were my first clients, I am not getting paid much (bascially doing it for free).

So ***I wanted to design a summer workshop where i teach people about App Development.*** No prior coding knowledge will be needed for this. And here are somethings I wanted to ask for help.

**1. What demographic should I focus on?** I was planning to target High School Students who can create these apps to put on their college applications or resumes. I was thinking of targeting University Students with a similar selling point. On the other hand, I was thinking of keeping it open to anyone who wants to experience building an app of their own. We will be using rapid code tools like FlutterFlow to give them an introduction of App Development.

**2. What would be a great project / app idea to build with beginners?** Essentially I was aiming to make the course project based. I want to teach them basics while helping them build an app that they can use. I was thinking of building like a Family App to make grocery list, plan events or put updates. But thought this might become complex. I was also thinking of maybe just building an app that wraps Gemini as an AI app based project. Essentially I want to make something valuable with the students so they can be proud of what they have made. I didn't want to do the To Do List app because there are tons of videos online about that. What would be some cool and simple apps that you'd like to build?

**3. How long should the entire course be?** I was planning to have synchronous classes live online. And was planning each class to be about 2 hrs. I was planning to make the course have 6 classes in total so (12hrs of teaching). Maybe the length of the course would also depend on the the project and demographic.

I am currently a student at UTD working on a startup and I'm seeking some advice from my fellow students. We've been pushing this ball for a while now and have recently grown to a team of 5. I would love to hear what fellow students thoughts on what we have so far and get some guidance on our next steps.

**Here's what we do:** We are developing an AI-driven educational technology app designed to proactively provide college students with exactly what they need, precisely when they need it. Our app integrates a familiar interface similar to popular social media platforms, making it easy for students to navigate and find resources tailored to their academic and personal needs.

**Here's why it's hard/hasn't been done yet:** Building an app that combines advanced AI technology with an intuitive user interface is a complex challenge. We are striving to balance sophisticated backend algorithms with a seamless frontend experience. Additionally, positioning ourselves as a non-profit organization in a predominantly for-profit industry adds another layer of complexity in terms of funding and partnerships.

**Here's why it's needed/why it matters:** College students often face overwhelming amounts of information and resources scattered across various platforms. This fragmentation makes it difficult for them to find the right support at the right time. Our app aims to centralize these resources, providing a one-stop solution that enhances their academic performance and overall college experience.

**Here are the people who will need it (and how they're currently solving it):** Our primary users are college students who currently rely on a mix of school websites, learning management systems like Canvas, social media groups, and word of mouth to find information and resources. This piecemeal approach is inefficient and often leaves students struggling to get timely help.

**Here's why we're the ones to build it:** Our team comprises passionate individuals with backgrounds in education, computer science, and financial planning. We have firsthand experience with the challenges students face and are committed to making a tangible difference. Additionally, we have a strong advisory board, including industry experts who are guiding us in the right direction.

**Here's how it works:** The app features a home page where students can see their current classes, similar to Canvas. By clicking on a class, students access tools and resources relevant to that subject. The app also includes an explore resources page, a chatbot powered by large language models for relevant school information, and a personalized student profile page.

**New Feature:** We are planning to add a feature that will help students manage their finances. Using AI, this feature will recommend actions students can take to improve their financial situation and point them to relevant scholarships, grants, and other financial aid opportunities. Our goal is to make financial guidance easily accessible, helping students navigate their financial challenges more effectively.

**Here's how big the market can be:** The higher education market is vast, with millions of students enrolled in colleges and universities globally. As we plan to compete with existing platforms whose contracts with schools expire by 2026, we see a significant opportunity to capture a share of this market. Our non-profit status also gives us a competitive edge in forming partnerships with educational institutions.

**What I'm seeking:**

* Feedback on our current approach and product.
* Advice on scaling our team and operations.
* Insights into effective marketing strategies for educational technology.
* Suggestions on implementing the new financial assistance feature.
* Any other tips or suggestions you might have.

Thank you so much for your time and input, fellow Comets!"

# Intro

This will be my ultimate guide on How to Make Hong Kong Milk Tea (HKMT). I made this guide because I've been answering various questions in the past few years over [here in this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/tea/comments/ofbrz7/how_can_i_make_hong_kong_milk_tea/). The infomation is spread around, so I thought I would clean up some of the info and document it somewhere. 

I won’t go into what HKMT is, because I assume you arrived here because you drank a cup from some HK cafe, tried to replicate it and failed. This guide will teach you how to make it as close as possible to what you’d get in a HK Cafe (cha chang teng). But before that, a brief intro to me.

>!I grew up in San Francisco in a Cantonese household. During high school was when I fell in love with HKMT, and a large part of that is attributed to a HK Cafe in the Sunset District called ABC Cafe & Bakery. Though they averaged a 2.5/5 star rating on Yelp, the go-to food review app at the time, their food at its peak was amazing, and true HK comfort food. I remember my mom and I would visit the cafe regularly after high school ended (1:30-2:30 pm) for their $5.50 afternoon tea set meals which came with a food item + a drink (+$0.50 for a cold drink). It was here that my love for HKMT was born.!<

>!I began with drinking their iced HKMT with boba. Yes not authentic. But as a high school student with a sweet tooth, the drink was really incredible. From there I transitioned to iced HKMT without boba. And then at some point, I started getting the hot HKMT (maybe it was a cold day). I fell in love with the drink and even began experimenting with making my own sometime around 2015-2016 after coming across a video on youtube teaching how to make it. Then in 2018, I made my first solo trip to HK where I went on a hunt for the best HKMT. Now this might sound crazy, but after trying around a dozen cups of HKMT in HK, I really didn’t find out that stood out. In fact, I would say the one I had at ABC was the best I had. The thing about HKMT, I find it really difficult to compare unless you have a very sophisticated sense of taste. I’m just a regular guy who loves this stuff.!<

# Equipment

First let’s go over what you need in order to start making HKMT. There are four main pieces of equipment which are a must for this recipe.

* [Teapot](https://www.kamcha.com.hk/en/shop/tea-leaves-equipment/equipment/teapot/) - The basic vessel to hold your tea. This recipe calls for 1.2L. If you want to make a double batch, you would need minimum 2.4 L. You should aim for something with a minimum of 1.5L or 3.0L depending on if you want to make a single or double batch. A single batch yields about 6 cups of HKMT.
* [Pitcher](https://www.kamcha.com.hk/en/shop/tea-leaves-equipment/equipment/pitcher/) - The pitcher is used to pull the tea during the brewing process
* [Ring](https://www.kamcha.com.hk/en/shop/tea-leaves-equipment/equipment/ring/) & [Tea Bag](https://www.kamcha.com.hk/en/shop/tea-leaves-equipment/equipment/tea-bag/) - The ring and tea bag are used to hold the tea leaves during the brewing process. Some places sell this together.

I assume you will have a stove of some sort as well for brewing.

Recommendations

* Teapot (Percolator) - [8 cup Farberware](https://www.amazon.com/Farberware-Classic-Stainless-Yosemite-Percolator/dp/B00005NCWQ/ref=sr_1_8?crid=1DWITLKKVR3E0&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.OOdb2IKrk5vfRsNS4WraZw8xH6N8VGwCt_EAc9iTsXsg_752Btv38q1o-RR6plargXB-pE-7x_La-waZQzi7uXZywJeSP5YMfybNkRjOCR0s0Uou1QhCyJNkH4qDvCM7AZMzqmpX-yQBiizhHxlKhnjEjD4R7IargannjFKq_ZOnGJFGdbeuTG6crGGtGhqJBCPL3HqoNa3xOXFBAOWvnBPLJ4nQneMUV3IJYhxixsfWTsmo_BiM8G3dp32_Y8CuZP5cLwFnrZuypkXzkt5hHHrBYmysI3hG8_i-Xujl2bI.7G1VtFCtAFn-obxRk6PMkg4-yAmfCyT6iOL0UcAVmao&dib_tag=se&keywords=percolator&qid=1717553775&sprefix=percolatp%2Caps%2C388&sr=8-8&th=1) - I have both the 8 cup and 12 cup version. I use the 8 cup version for a single batch, and the 12 cup version for a double batch. This is not as authentic as the ones they use in HK, but it was the best I could find in the US at the time and didn’t break the bank.
* [Pitcher](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08ML5VN95/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1) - This is the exact thing I bought. You can certainly use anything similar to this.
* [Ring and Tea Bag](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07QMFQT54/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) - This is one of the products I use. Get one that matches the circumference and depth as your teapot as close as you can.

# Ingredients

There are only 3 ingredients when it comes to making HKMT. While the list itself is simple, the ingredients are crucial to making a good cup of HKMT. Every ingredient matters, and choosing the right type or brand makes a massive difference. I don’t mean to be a gatekeeper in how YOU should enjoy your HKMT. If you ask me what makes a cup of HKMT it’s a strong black tea paired with evaporated milk and sugar. But since there are thousands of varieties of tea, your results are going to vary drastically from tea to tea. In the end, if you want to make a cup similar to what you’d get in HK, you need the right ingredients.

* Tea - This is the most crucial element and cannot be overlooked. I often see recipes call for Ceylon tea or X tea and this is doing such a huge disservice to HKMT lovers.
* Evaporated Milk - It’s evaporated milk. Get it right. It’s not condensed milk. You can add condensed milk as a sweetener, but let’s get the basics down and start with simply evaporated milk
* Sugar - plain ole granulated white sugar. Add to taste. I don’t suggest using an alternative, at least not initially, because it could change the taste.

# Specific Ingredients

Here I’ll list very specific ingredients that I believe will lead you to the most authentic cup of hkmt you will make at home.

Tea blends (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED)

1. HK brew tea [https://www.homebrewteahk.com/](https://www.homebrewteahk.com/) - Yan, the owner, is great and has some content on youtube. I took their online course and bought each of their 3 or 4 blends of tea. I enjoyed them all. They have differences, but they all pass the HKMT test in my book.
2. Kam Cha - [https://www.k-smart.ca/collections/black-tea](https://www.k-smart.ca/collections/black-tea) - This site is based in Canada, but they shipped to California. I bought a few of their blends (I believe the Kam Cha Premium Blend and #1 Dai Pai Dong Blend. They both pass the HKMT test in my book.

If you ask which one I prefer? Honestly I would go by whichever one is cheaper, or easier to ship (Kamcha/Ksmart). But if you are closer to HK, you can go for that HomeBrewTeaHK.

Tea leaves - I don’t recommend you making your own blends, but if you want to try for whatever reason, here are a few products I personally used with some success.

1. Lipton from [HK](https://www.pns.hk/en/yellow-label-pkt/p/BP_100790)
2. Rickshaw from [amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Rickshaw-Black-Tea-450-Grams/dp/B004WB7G46/ref=sr_1_1?crid=O2NCTV1XZFTC&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.4YBAaBjE0WsvwETcZ1SpY4tWdrHdTJI7OsqtWpf3YRZ4WPao3n-q1SOJe9IKotKvBMDWG_uAFWM18jTBkG2D7HC8HTjKr3vVMxzLcKsBTJ9l6PZ6eqihHYUjW3sRFOoh6CEgt25BNtLcOFhouHglM0JxtDHkcwej9-_cNXSH5pcXvLPXNW_Z-J9OLWRjqtWlIRgJgq4mnBpDsCH8B2FO-mHyzrG8ewP45jn7c1RX86SF75XPeG2ll5bQ3I1oqS_NwfAsJeUjT6qWk_aAZW-allulIl1pxfick6_U7NgsaqY.1jIUdcwAsCVlhF4JDgMxPcqXw_vzQsYA97FSwPqbpqE&dib_tag=se&keywords=rickshaw+tea&qid=1717556777&s=home-garden&sprefix=rickshaw+%2Cgarden%2C392&sr=1-1)

Note: Not all Lipton teas are the same. Even though both of the Liptons I listed above are called Yellow Label, they are two different products. Lipton uses different teas in different markets.

From these, here’s a recipe I used which yielded acceptable results for my tastes:

Blend 1:

* 35g HK Lipton
* 15g Rickshaw
* 10g Alzahwah

Evaporated milk

1. Black and white - I’ve used their normal one as well as their premium one. From memory the normal (cheaper one) has a bunch of additives while the premium one is more natural. The cheaper one tastes better to me.
2. Avoid Carnation brand. The taste is significantly more bland.

Sugar - no specific recommendation but I use C and W

# Explanation of tea types and ratios

To make your own blend of tea, you should familiarize yourself with some of the terminology used.

* Dust (Fine)- The main purpose of tea dust is to bring out the flavor
* BOPF (Medium)- The main purpose of BOPF (Broken Orange Pekoe Fannings) is to adjust the smoothness
* BOP (Coarse)- The main purpose of BOP (Broken Orange Pekoe) is to adjust the color and fragrance

This is the secret sauce when it comes to HKMT. Every shop and every HKMT master has their own formula and ratios. Use the guidelines above to adjust to your liking. I’ll give you an idea for a starting point where you can then adjust to your standards: 60% Fine, 30% Medium, 10% Coarse.

# The Process

First I want to explain that I’m a regular guy that has a passion for food. Whenever I learn a new dish, I spend hours watching YouTube videos and reading books/blogs, and really pour my heart into making it the best way possible. I don’t skimp on time nor quality of ingredients. My journey with homemade HKMT began roughly 10 years ago. I watched a YouTube video of a random guy making it, and I loosely copied what he did. It tasted alright, but was far from CCT standard. From there I was on and off on making HKMT at home. It wasn’t until 2019 where I really started getting more serious. I was traveling to Guangzhou, and randomly stumbled across a shop displaying trophies. I was intrigued, and even more so when I walked closer and realized they were selling HKMT. I knew I had to try. It turns out that the owner won the HKMT championship in 2015 for their yuanyang (HKMT + coffee) part of the competition. I will say their yuanyang was the best I’ve ever had. It might be my #1 favorite drink in the world, and I think I like it more than the best HKMT I’ve had. I can attest that theirHKMT is solid. Anyway, after falling in love with their drink, I noticed a 99 rmb version. I was intrigued and asked the store manager about it. She mentioned it was the owner’s championship formula, and must be preordered, and the owner will personally demonstrate the entire process. I was sold. A week or so later, I sat down with the master and watched him make his champion yuangyang. So I learned the entire process, but not the exact formula. My process today is a very close copy of his method. With that as my base, I returned home in 2020 due to covid, and all my local shops with the best HKMT didn’t make it right anymore. My guess is that their tea supply was cut off because of that Evergreen shipping incident. So that just further pushed me to learn to make my own HKMT.

The actual process

Ingredients:

* 60g tea blend
* 1200g water
* 1 can evaporated milk

If making a double batch:

* 120g tea blend
* 2300g water
* 2 cans evaporated milk

The reason there is less water in this is because you have less evaporation as a result of increasing the batch size.

Note that I use these ratios which are based on the size of a can of evaporated milk. I have no other use for evaporated milk, so instead of storing it in my fridge, I just make a batch using exactly 1 can of evaporated milk.

Steps

1. Bring water to a boil
2. Pour tea blend into tea bag
3. When water is boiling, do two tea pulls\*. The first pull will be into the empty pitcher. The second pull will be back into the tea pot.
4. Brew the tea on medium-high heat for 10 minutes. The idea here is to extract as much out of the tea in a short time. You want a medium-high heat so the water is moving inside the pot with enough force to get some good mixing going on (i don’t know if this actually happens)
5. Turn the heat to low, then proceed with 4 pulls. At this point, the tea leaves should have clumped up inside the tea bag. The idea here is to loosen the leaves a bit to encourage more extraction in the next phase. The tea should be back in the tea pot after 4 pulls. You don’t need to pull too high because that can cause the temperature to drop too much.
6. Brew on low heat for 15 minutes. At this stage we are continuing to extract the flavors from the tea, but we don’t want to boil excessively or we will lose too much liquid.
7. Prepare a warm cup and fill up 1/4 of the cup with evaporated milk.
8. Fill the rest of the cup with tea
9. Add sugar to taste

# Variations

A note on ratios

A great cup of hkmt contains evaporated milk and tea. The general recommendation is you want somewhere between 25-33% evaporated milk, with 25% being the more common recommendation: 2oz of evaporated milk and 6oz of tea. It boils down to personal taste, so feel free to adjust to your own taste.

For my method, I usually make it in a large batch, so I start with 1 can of evaporated milk (354g) and I squeeze as much tea out of my tea bag (which is usually around 900g). 354/1254 is roughly 28.2% so if you need a number go with that. Then I add roughly 50g of sugar (4%) and that is my final product.

Milk or tea first. I go with milk first, and I would estimate that is the standard. In general, this way the milk is more smooth (you slowly raise the temperature of the milk and tempur it), whereas if you pour cold milk into a large portion of tea, the milk has a chance to curdle.

With some fairly recent changes, but the general idea is the same. A Cosmic Horror fanfic.

There are still a lot of things I need to figure out, but the plot is as follows:

*The next thing he notices is that he's twice as big as the day before. Everyone at the mystery shack panics at the sight of Dipper. Wendy was the last to see him, but seeing how Dipper was half a head taller than her, her mind didn't know how to process it.*

*But that's not all. His eyes, fingers, and birthmark glow a very light blue. He also gained a lot of strength and endurance.*

*Why did all this happen? One would think that Dipper became some kind of superhero. But Ford believes that's not the case. In fact, it seems that Dipper has become a weapon, as all the creatures in Gravity Falls are either scared to death by the sight of him, or become quite hostile.*

*And to complicate things even more, new creatures that Ford has never seen before appear in town. And they are quite aggressive.*

*Dipper's physical change seems to indicate a bad omen. Something is coming, but what is it?*

*What is going on?""*



This would be the general plot, now it is time to explain how the story will develop:

Everything will revolve around Dipper and how he learns that everyone is nothing more than insignificant beings living in such a complex and dangerous world. So much death and destruction will mean nothing. For Bill it doesn't.

In this story there will be three main characters: Dipper, Mabel, and Wendy.

Dipper and Wendy will develop a very strong bond. They will become so close that without realizing it, they will be emotionally dependent on each other.



Yes, this story is ***Wendip***. But it will be a rather complex Wendip in the end.

To better explain how I plan to take this ship. I will base it on the relationship of “Gokusen”, for those who do not know it, Gokusen it's a manga about a Yakuza who wants to be a teacher, and she teaches at a school with unruly students.

Here Dipper knows that Wendy only sees him as a friend, she has already rejected him and he cannot do anything about it. So he just decides to be by her side and help her when she needs him.

With his new abilities, Dipper manages to make an excellent team with Wendy. Feeling capable of doing dangerous things with her that would initially terrify him. Supporting each other at all times.

This will make Wendy to start depending on him. Wanting to do more “cool” things with him. Opening up her insecurities with him. Asking him for advice. Making her sometimes forget that Dipper is younger than her.

The relationship with his sister will be the same as always. Doing a lot of things together and annoying each other. But as the plot progresses, Mabel will feel that Dipper is moving away from her. Not in the sense that he doesn't want to hang out with her anymore. More like Dipper will lose his humanity at some point.

He will tell her something that will break her heart, causing her to get lost. And it will be Dipper's responsibility to find her.



Now comes the part with **\[SPOILERS\]**:

Dipper wakes up at the age of a 15-year-old boy, but his mind is still technically the same. The reason he grew up was because a ""White Entity."" Let's call it that. It freed Dipper from Bill's clutches, in exchange he must help him stop an imminent threat. Granting him abilities and cosmic knowledge. The latter is incredibly heavy for a common living being. The more the user learns, the older he becomes.

The skills he acquired allow him to purify/exorcise people who are being manipulated by cosmic entities. I also thought that his eyes and birthmark would glow when there is a dangerous creature nearby but I'm not sure.

As the story progresses, his missions will become more dangerous and to a certain extent traumatic.

There will come a time when another cosmic entity will appear in front of the protagonists. And with the helplessness of not being able to do anything, they will watch in horror as Dipper is forced to acquire more knowledge. Making him grow two more years.

And with all this of the monsters wanting to kill him, and the cosmic entities torturing him at will, they will leave him quite affected.

Wendy will have a severe trauma that will not be noticeable at first sight. At some point she will begin to have dreams with a macabre entity in the forest that promises to take her to her mother. There will come a time where that creature will make Wendy break down emotionally. Thus revealing that all this time she has been repressing her feelings. And all those emotions transform her into a gloomy monster. Who will howl all the sorrows she has been through.

Mabel will have one of the ugliest destinies. She will end up being possessed by Bill. The triangle will give her knowledge, making her grow two years. He will enclose Mabel's personality in a bubble that will make her see all her desires, in this case her version of a perfect world. And her body will be controlled by a new psychopathic personality. Being Bill's right hand.

You see, Dipper and Mabel's parents are dysfunctional. The twins were afraid to return home, since they always saw their parents fighting. Causing Mabel to have a dissociative disorder. But in this case, Mabel imagines her own world. A perfect fantasy world. Where everything is happiness, and her brother is there to follow her.

But it only took one bad day for that fictional world to fall apart. Making her an easy victim for Bill.



I wanted to change Bill's Zodiac. My intention is to make it more mystical and dangerous. The difference between the series and this universe is that here it is not a weapon against Bill. They are his horsemen of the apocalypse.

They are the ones who will start the chaos and open the door for Bill to unleash all the destruction he wants.

Basically, each symbol represents a fear of the characters; it may be very repressed, but Bill knows that by provoking it a little, all of them will lose their minds and be under his control:

Pinetree: Dipper's fear of the time he got lost in the woods after running away from a fight between his parents. Coming to believe that no one would bother to look for him.

Shooting Star: Mabel's fear of losing her fantasy reality. She prefers living in her fictional world a thousand times over the cruel reality.

Bag of Ice: Wendy's trauma after finding her mother frozen to death.

Oyster: Stan's fear of being hated by his loved ones and dying alone.

Question Mark: Soos' fear of being considered a burden to others.

Six Hands: Ford's fear of being considered a monster.

Heart: Represents Robbie's helplessness and low self-esteem. Easily manipulated.

Pair of Spectables: McGucket's fear of knowledge. Knowing too much drove him crazy.

Llama: Pacifica's family crest. She’s afraid of her own family.

Pentagram: Gideon's fear of accepting reality. He's a loser that everyone hates.



I still have several things to add to make the story coherent. In fact, there are some key moments in the story that I want to get to. But I don't know how I could make the characters get there:

- Wendy invites Dipper on a trip through the mountains of Gravity Falls with her father and brothers. The group ends up being attacked by a giant and gloomy bear.

- Dipper and Mabel go out with Wendy and her friends, but the meeting goes wrong when Robbie ends up turning into a bat monster.

- Dipper begins to notice that the missions are more than Wendy can handle. But she pretends to be okay.

- The Pines family along with Wendy and Soos go to a haunted mansion. But the ghost was just bait for Dipper.

- Dipper is attacked by a giant worm with a child's face.

- Wendy runs to hug Dipper, while he sobs from the mental torture he just received from the entities. She strokes his hair while whispering *""It's over. I'm here.""*

- Dipper watches as inside Mabel's mind there is a giant garden, full of flowers and life. She is happy, and it hurts him too much to force her to wake up.

- The forest entity makes Wendy break down for the first time in 5 years. She cries on Dipper's chest while he hugs him. All while she sobs the word *“Mom”*

- Dipper describes Bill’s intention as being quite childish, dangerous and complex. The only reason he does this is because he wants to upset another entity. But this deity has the ability to destroy the entire universe by simply making the slightest sound.

- The freed riders, survivors, and soldiers from the future face Bill’s army in a battle similar to the *“Battle of Minas Tirith”*. Which causes Dipper to have 26 fits of pleasure. Regardless of the fact that his life is in danger.

  
And that's all I have of my story. I still need to detail more lore, but it's all I have so far. I like to make a great character development and a universe where beings beyond our control leave us powerless.

If you like it or have any contribution that can help the development of the story I would be happy to read it :)



P.S: I made this image around 2016. It represents the epilogue of the story. “Dipper and Bill end up on a beach. Bill calls it limbo. Here, there is no rivalry. There is no war. Only defeat”

1ekr8yg,8,2024-08-05,Follow the market and focus on value - don't get lost in more 'education',u/throwing-it-out,TeachersInTransition,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeachersInTransition/comments/1ekr8yg/follow_the_market_and_focus_on_value_dont_get/,"Hey teachers! I tried to comment on another teacher-coach post with some words of advice and accidentally wrote a monster... thought I'd just share it here instead to try to give some perspective.  I worked in a really nice school, but the administration wasn't supportive and the district-level admins were super corrupt.  I had something like 4 different close colleagues who also wanted a pathway out of teaching, and I wanted to outline some missteps and advocate for my low-cost method as an alternative.  For context, 1 colleague got an admin license, another got a Master's, another an ELL endorsement, and another transitioned into coaching.  None of them made it out of teaching.  I paid for 0 education and did get out this last June.  


Not sure it'll help, but here's my story:    
  
I started taking student teachers at every possible turn, poaching the best ones based on their bio submissions from the college.  It freed up parts of my daytime (because everything else is so darn busy with coaching and life) to revise my resume and begin looking for open positions.

Do not return to school unless you're completing a professional degree (nursing, accounting, engineering) - and even then, there is no degree that will give you the value you want without the requisite skills and experience that will differentiate you from a 25 year-old that has the same piece of paper.  Instead of exploring your interests or pursuing education first, I would encourage you to start by looking at the market - go on LinkedIn and Indeed and look at what positions are education-adjacent and see what the titles and compensation are.  Then, start thinking about what you can do to 'become' the roles that interest you.  For me, I was always technically-minded and liked solving problems.  I wanted a role that combined technology and project management - and that meant there were a lot of potential matches out on the market.  But that was super general, and I knew from the postings that matched those keywords that I really lacked desired skills.  
  
I think as teachers we need to ask ourselves how to fill skills gaps between where we're at and what the postings are asking for.  You can retune a resume a lot, but if an ID role wants you to have Articulate experience... you aren't getting that without actually trying it.  But you have to understand that, for a bright person and quick learner like I assume you are, ""a year of experience"" really just means ""I used it for a project once"".  And that's what I'd encourage you to do - start working on small projects that develop and demonstrate marketable skills (build something of value for YOURSELF in your current teaching role, but also make it fit your desired role).  At my new workplace, there are two other teachers who successfully transitioned there as well.  One works in Assessment and was able to show their know-how in the statistics of that trade to land their job.  The other works in Product and did Google endorsements learning the language of UI / UX and other desirables about the role from podcasts and YouTube.  
  
Once you've started doing role-relevant projects, make sure you use AI to tune your resume to each sort of role (e.g. instructional design, product management, curriculum development, project management) and place the relevant project as your top experience.  You will then modify your teaching and coaching experience to fit the 'corporatese' that the hiring manager will want your resume and cover letter to look like.  Again, an AI is going to do this more effectively and efficiently than you can with your limited time.  Start applying so you can get a sense for what's spam and what's a legitimate opportunity.  Apply directly on the company website when possible.  I applied to over 100 positions between October '23 and April '24 to get my new job - it's just the way that cookie crumbles these days.

So how do you start finding the right projects?  Well, be ready to accept both success and failure (but we all know you've dealt with that, you're a teacher!), and pick what interests you that's relevant to the job postings you like.  I had the enormous benefit of a friend coming to me who wanted to work on an AI project.  This was about two years ago, before ChatGPT blew up.  We were going to automatically adjust lexile levels for readings and produce instructional materials for teachers (formatives and attention-maintenance tasks) just by having them upload the grade-level reading - an idea so good, almost every EdTech company with real money did exactly that and more by the time that we had a functioning website!  But I used that sorta failed project as a springboard to teach myself prompting and LLMs.  I took on side-hustles teaching online so I could argue that I had remote work experience.  I developed my side-hustle remote courses entirely using AI prompts, then slapped that on my resume as proof of new-age curriculum development know-how.  When I started getting serious bites on my resume from remote teaching places, I realized how little I wanted to do the teaching part and how much I wanted to do the technical part instead. I saw that automation using AI was a huge market space, so I progressed into trying no-code automation to automate my own job (grading essays from high schoolers and pumping the AI output and feedback comments directly into Canvas).  I got frustrated with those websites' limitations (Zapier, Make, etc couldn't do what I wanted), so I started teaching myself to code a bit (quick aside: real devs will hate me for saying this, but AI is an AMAZING resource for learning to code, and it's totally free.  I took a java course in college and found it so irrelevant and boring... but with AI, you can build something that actually has value to you, figure out how to get it to run, and then learn later how the methods work instead of wasting time learning how to write ""Hello World"").  Around the start of April this year, I wrote my first Python script so nobody on my team would have to grade essay tests again - just hand me a Canvas authentication key and I'll have an AI do it all for you.  Some of my coworkers were paying $15 a month to do that with EdTech websites, and it felt awesome to put in the work that, in the end, cost me like $1 for 3 whole teachers to not have to grade 100 submissions each.  Once you land on a project that gives you THAT feeling, chase it all the way to a job.

I was in rounds of interviews for a higher ed curriculum organization by the end of April and accepted a role in a curriculum team before the end of the school year.  If I can encourage anything, it's that you get your foot in the door SOMEWHERE.  As I think many teachers find when they transition into the private sector, this company was SHOCKED that (1) I could actually do the things that I'd put on my resume and (2) knew how to handle hard work and stress.  You've just gotta take that first step into a new place and build those relationships with your leaders to show your potential. Unlike teaching, you'll also be able to use the free time that comes with every non-teaching job to keep upskilling and applying to new jobs.

I apply to about 5 jobs a week and refresh my resume weekly.  I enjoy coding, so I try to do bigger and better things that can benefit my company when I have free time on the weekends.  I can now write pretty solid automation scripts that organize my team's data or take care of our repetitive web editing tasks.  I'm writing a mobile app and creating a website as a side project with a friend.  I'll continue advising a remote school part-time as an instructional coach to help them increase adoption of AI tools. I'll be pushing for a compensation increase from my company this fall, and my boss has basically said they're gonna do whatever they can to keep me.

  
TL;DR: You can do this if you focus on going to market with marketable skills.  I don't think that my journey is out of reach for good teachers.  We handle SO MUCH without ever seeing our skills get rewarded, and we can learn new things quickly.  But the market is a pretty brutal instrument - it only cares about the value you can provide to an employer, and it's really hard to say that teachers come out of a classroom ready to provide value on day 1.  That's why we should all be upskilling and practicing our 'corporatese' so we can use the two websites and two tools that an employer may desire for an upwardly-mobile role.

  
Good luck, and reach out if you want to know anything more."

Hi everyone,

I'm a university teacher with autism, and I'm finding it increasingly challenging to navigate the social dynamics of the classroom. While I deeply care for my students and work hard to mask my difficulties, there are certain aspects that I find particularly tough:

1. Language and Explanation: Sometimes, I struggle to articulate points clearly, even though I understand them well. This occasionally leads to students being mean or sarcastic, which I find hard to interpret.

2. Body Language: I often can't read students' body language, so I have trouble discerning whether they're being sincere or sarcastic. This adds to my anxiety and makes classroom interactions more stressful.

3. Classroom Plans: When a lesson plan doesn't go as expected, it can be quite depressing. Additionally, if a student tries to take advantage of my kindness, it deeply affects me.

4. Home Environment: I don't have a very supportive household. My family doesn't understand my challenges and views me as stubborn and impolite. They only come to me for solutions to their problems, which adds to my stress.

5. Career Pressure: I'm worried about my career prospects because if I don't get good reviews, I won't get a promotion. I know I'm good at my job, but the emphasis on social skills feels overwhelming.

6. I use ChatGPT to write out my interactions in Google Classroom or even texts because I have been mocked for my ""language"" and ""tone"" before. Since there is a lot of things at risk now, I find ChatGPT to be safe for my communications. But it is very tiresome. 

I'm reaching out to see if anyone has advice on managing these challenges. How can I improve my interactions with students and colleagues? How can I better cope with the social demands of my job while staying true to myself?

Any tips or shared experiences would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

(Would love if students will also advise.)

FYI. I am seeing therapist but this is for a general understanding) :) "

Before building it, I knew that there were some competitors, like [dende.ai](http://dende.ai) that are getting quite popular. But what makes me stand out ? I am completely FOR FREE. 

I’ve created the app, because a friend of mine once created a PDF Multiple choice test for our Biology exam with chatGPT, using a lot of prompt engineering to getgood questions and answers that are on a masters student level.

A lot of colleagues, including me, thought it was great help, so I’ve decided to take it a step further and build an AI app around it.

I know that not everyone has the money for GPT4o, so I made my app completely free and cover all api costs for the first period. 

The lesson I’ve learned from it- **Launch an MVP as soon as possible and get feedback**. I’ve built the app in 1 week and I know it is not perfect. But the great user feedback encourages me to keep building on it and improve."

In each course, we have a bunch of course related material- learning resources, tips, guides, examples, warnings about common mistakes and so on.  It's not a lot of material (not like a book), but still a decent amount and highly relevant.

So the question is this:  would it be possible to ""train"" the AI on that material, then somehow share it with the students in that course, so that when a student has a question about some course content, the AI answers partially based on the source material that was shared?  Or, for example, when they have to do a discussion post, they ask the AI if it looks good, and the AI tells them that it fits or does not fit the guidelines/warnings/previous examples that were in the course materials.

So basically my question is in two parts: can the AI be trained to use those materials, and then can that be shared with the students somehow?

I know there are things like google notebook and nvidia's chat that can train on your files, but I don't think they can be easily shared with others afterwards.  Can this be done with Claude?  If it can, Will it require an investment by the school to be able to be shared with the students (It could be a trained AI shared for each course, or maybe a much larger, ""combined"" single AI that has all the courses in it)?"

After getting Selected for the Ontario Summer Company program, I have been building my Software agency and have gotten 2 clients so far.

Essentially I specialize in building Mobile Apps for schools and community centers which helps them communicate with their members and send updates regarding events. However, since these were my first clients, I am not getting paid much (bascially doing it for free).

So I was designing a summer workshop where i teach people about App Development. ***No prior coding knowledge will be needed for this***. And here are somethings I wanted to ask for help.

**1. What demographic should I focus on?** 

The course does not require prior coding background so anyone can take this course. Maybe as a recreation course to learn a new skill online or explore where the Software Industry is for you to explore. We will be using rapid code tools like FlutterFlow to give them an introduction of App Development. I was planning to target High School Students who can create these apps to put on their college applications or resumes. I was thinking of targeting University Students with a similar selling point. I wanted to know if I should be targeting a specific audience or try to keep the funnel broad.

**2. What would be a great project / app idea to build with beginners?** Essentially I was aiming to make the course project based. I want to teach them basics while helping them build an app that they can use. I was thinking of building like a Family App to make grocery list, plan events or put updates. But thought this might become complex. I was also thinking of maybe just building an app that wraps Gemini as an AI app based project. Essentially I want to make something valuable with the students so they can be proud of what they have made. I didn't want to do the To Do List app because there are tons of videos online about that. What would be some cool and simple apps that you'd like to build?

**3. How long should the entire course be?** I was planning to have synchronous classes live online. And was planning each class to be about 2 hrs. I was planning to make the course have 6 classes in total so (12hrs of teaching). Is this sufficient to teach them basic to intermediate level of FF App Dev and have a project ready for them?

**4. How much should I price the course?** The big question. I was planning to charge about $99/student. They would get 12 hrs of live lectures and have the opportunity to book extra QA sessions (like office hours) if they have any confusion with that price. Again, I want to help them build something of value and have fun.

**5 Anything else?** Is there anything else I must be careful of? I am new to designing a course and teaching it myself online, but I am well versed with App Development and public speaking. Is there any other input anyone has?

1elanhx,1,2024-08-06,Do developers seriously think that AI is good for learning?,u/tandonhiten,developersIndia,https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/1elanhx/do_developers_seriously_think_that_ai_is_good_for/,"Hey people, I hope y'all are doing great. I was reading [a post from earlier today](https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/1el5xx7/is_it_wrong_to_use_chatgpt_a_lot_for_coding_as_a/) about whether or not to use AI tools like Chat GPT for learning. Now, I being a learning dev myself immediately went, no you should not, however a lot of people actually seem to think that it is completely fine to use AI to learn DSA and dev, I read some of their points and they were mostly in the line of ""AI is a tool, use it like one, no need to feel sorry"", I for one disagree with that and my rationale was the following:

1. __AI like Chat GPT is good at doing what you ask it to do but not so good at teaching__: Teaching requires you to first give an example and then encourage the student to try the question themself. However, AI doesn't do that. AI simply knows how to answer your questions, which sounds good because if you ask the correct questions you can actually learn what you're supposed to except for one problem which is beginner devs often don't know what to ask. As someone who has younger siblings to teach, you won't believe how many times there questions are limited to - Sibling: ""I don't understand it"", Me: ""which part of it?"", Sibling: ""all of it."" and this isn't just with my siblings I once tried to help my college batchmates and got the same answers, and heck even I used to do that when I started, I don't now because now I've been learning for about 8 years, but I do remember being utterly clueless about what was going on initially. Had I just used AI back then to solve the problems and had I not looked into what I was doing, I prolly wouldn't have improved.

2. __Point of DSA is not to write the solution, it's to reach the solution__: DSA is like mathematics. For most devs it's utterly useless IRL. Unless you're a kernel, compiler or standard library dev, for the most part you'll never use any datastructure other than array lists, hash maps and hash sets. Maybe a tree map and tree set or a queue or priority queue in rare cases but even then you won't write anything yourself. You'll use the standard library of the language you're using or a package that implements the said data structure for the language. You won't write anything yourself other than code to slightly manipulate your results. You won't give 2 fucks about what is the time and space complexity of the code you write because, let's be honest if people cared about the time their code takes to run, we won't see so many companies use JS and python. So DSA is useless there. The only actual reason you want to learn DSA is so that you can enhance your problem solving skills, by using AI whenever you get stuck you're not gonna do that. The only way to develop problem solving skills is by solving problems, not by taking solutions to those problems and trying to remember them.

3. __AI can hallucinate__: AI doesn't gurantee you correct answers and correct explanations, especially for harder problems. For example if you ask Chat GPT a problem which requires say Aho Corasick algorithm for string searching it may get that in a few tries but let's say you create a problem which uses the Aho Corasick for list searching, which remember, technically can be done because Aho Corasick is based on Finite Automaton which works for any array like Data structure (i.e. any linear data structure) and not just strings, it's just most commonly used for strings, Chat GPT won't be able to do that, because it just doesn't know how to, now you may ask why tf would a beginner do Aho corasick, but, may I remind you of [Dunning-Kruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect). It is completely possible that a novice dev who doesn't know better tries to use AI to solve a hard problem and fails miserably because they don't really know what they're doing.

4.__AI is better than a novice dev but worse than a junior dev__: Watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_cSLPv34xk) video from Neetcode. I have had similar experiences with AI in the past and hence I agree with him completely in what he says, AI is better than a novice dev but worse than a Junior one.

However I am not claiming to be a perfect dev. I am painfully aware that I have many shortcomings and hence I would like to hear all of your opinions. Do you think AI is really good for learning how to program, or do you agree with me but have different points for it?"

1eli34m,1,2024-08-06,Beginner: Advice on Extremely Ambitious Agent-Based Long-Horizon Storytelling,u/Common-Comedian7128,LangChain,https://www.reddit.com/r/LangChain/comments/1eli34m/beginner_advice_on_extremely_ambitious_agentbased/,"**Context:** I have an ambitious idea about using agents for long-horizon text-only storytelling but have limited technical knowledge. I hope more experienced individuals can offer input on feasibility and potential challenges.

**Project Overview:** My goal is to create very detailed, long form AI roleplaying software where users aren't just reading a novel, they are the protagonist. In my experience, AI can produce passable prose (Claude 3.5), but it struggles with story progression and planning, often resulting in circular narratives. To address this, I plan to use agents to create a detailed plot outline based on a user-supplied premise. The AI will narrate, and the user will act as the protagonist. Every time the protagonist acts, the AI will follow a series of escalating questions to assess and rewrite the outline as needed to keep the story cohesive:

1. Does this fit with the next planned beat? If yes, the writer AI continues; if not,
2. Does this fit with the scene? If yes, rewrite the beat; if not,
3. Does this fit with the chapter outline? If yes, rewrite the scene and beat; if not,
4. Does this fit with the arc?

This way, the story always has an outline to stay on track but can pivot as needed based on the protagonist's actions.

**Assumptions:**

1. Using a series of repeating agents, AI can generate and refine variations of a user-supplied premise into hyper-specific instructions. AI-written content often lacks specificity, which I plan to address through careful prompting and QA agents.
2. I can break up the long horizon task of impromptu novel writing (AI roleplaying) into discrete chunks I can hand off to specific agents that will only see their little section of the walled garden. This feels risky because different sections might need to know about each other to be cohesive and it could be hard to predict what that shared knowledge pool might need to be without making it so large the cost and wait time balloon beyond toleration.
3. That this won’t run afoul of the bitter lesson - where I have to get so granular I stray into deterministic logic which is inherently limiting and better solved with waiting for GPT-4.5.
4. I can get the response time from user input to the next beat written to a tolerable experience. I plan to make what I can run concurrently and use a bag of tricks to lessen the perceived waiting time.

The plot outline to keep things on track is table stakes for me. My real goal is far more ambitious (and far-fetched) about making the characters come alive:

* Give all / many of the characters encountered their own AI which fully fleshes out their backstory, goals, personality, outlook, relationships with other AI characters, and gives them agency to pursue those minor/major goals as the book unfolds. The events other characters set in motion will be experienced by the protagonist whether it’s breaking and entering or being crabby in a conversation because they get hangry and it’s lunch time.
* Create true repercussions for actions the protagonist or other characters take. If the protagonist as a student is rude, the AI controlling the teacher will assign detention, the unpleasantness determined by the AI of the teacher administering the detention 

I know a tiny amount of code (enough to hard code Towers of Hanoi in terminal) and with AI’s help, have Open Router hooked up to a local python program in VS Code where it writes to a local document. I plan to create tons of little documents the agents will write/read to. In my day job I work at a startup as a UX designer, have lots of  senior engineering FAANG friends and have played extensively with AI, particularly with storytelling including programs like Sudowrite and Novelcrafter. 

I haven’t yet messed with agents. What do you predict will be the hardest parts of this project and what are the odds of success? I suspect the programming will be simple, the prompting will be finicky, the lag challenging and the cost fairly high even with GPT-4o mini. Even if I succeed, the output will probably be average until GPT-4.5 comes along."
1ellnjs,1,2024-08-06,💡 New App Idea: Node-Based LLM Interaction for Enhanced Productivity - Seeking Feedback!,u/Artistic-Lock-6710,getdisciplined,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1ellnjs/new_app_idea_nodebased_llm_interaction_for/,"Hey everyone!

I’ve been working on a new app concept that I think could revolutionize how we interact with large language models (LLMs) and manage complex discussions. I’d love to get your feedback and insights on it! 🙌



**🎯 What is it?**

Imagine a node-based interface where each conversation can branch into different threads or nodes. Each node retains the context of the main discussion but focuses on a specific subtopic. This structure is designed to help users manage complex projects, brainstorm ideas, and collaborate more effectively.

  
**🚧 Challenges with Current Interfaces:**

When using current LLM conversational interfaces, I’ve noticed a few significant challenges. Tracking and revisiting previous topics in a linear sequence is cumbersome, making it hard to organize and connect information meaningfully. The sheer volume of information generated can be overwhelming, leading to cognitive overload. As I explore multiple topics, the interface can quickly become visually cluttered, making it difficult to understand the relationships between different discussions. Additionally, the constant need to switch contexts between exploring information and synthesizing insights disrupts my workflow and makes the process inefficient.



**🧩 Key Features:**

**1. Contextual Clarity**:

* Each node focuses on a specific aspect, making it easier to manage detailed discussions.
* Context retention ensures continuity and relevance.

**2. Organized Navigation**:

* Hierarchical navigation allows easy access to different nodes without losing track of the main topic.
* A visual map displays the overall structure and interconnections between nodes.

**3. Flexibility**:

* Parallel discussions can happen simultaneously without cluttering the main thread.
* Focused collaboration on specific nodes enhances productivity.



**📚 Potential Use Cases:**

* **Project Management**: Break down complex projects into manageable sub-tasks, each with its own discussion thread.
* **Brainstorming Sessions**: Organize brainstorming ideas into separate nodes for clarity and further development.
* **Research and Development**: Track different research topics and their progress in an organized manner.
* **Customer Support**: Handle multiple customer queries simultaneously, with each issue in its own node.
* **Educational Purposes**: Facilitate student-teacher interactions with focused discussion nodes for each topic or assignment.



**🚀 Why I’m Excited:**

I believe this app can significantly improve productivity and collaboration across various fields. Whether you’re managing a project, conducting research, or brainstorming new ideas, this structured approach can help you stay organized and focused.



**🤔 How You Can Help:**

**Would you find this tool useful?** If so, in what context?

**What features would you like to see?** Any must-haves or deal-breakers?

**What potential challenges do you foresee?** How can we address them?



**🙏 Thank You!**

Your feedback is incredibly valuable to me. I’m looking forward to hearing your thoughts and making this concept even better with your input!



**TL;DR:**

I’m developing a node-based app for LLM interactions to enhance productivity and manage complex discussions. Seeking feedback on its usefulness, features, and potential challenges. Share your thoughts!

I am a senior at a University about to graduate in May 2025 with a BS in Elementary Education. I cannot express how extremely excited I am to be done with college and start my dream career.

Just to cut to the chase, I’ve been researching schools in my area (I did not grow up here so I’m mostly unfamiliar) and I’m trying to pick where I want to student teach and potentially land a job.

I’ve used Google and ChatGPT as much as I could to learn about my top 4 picks and any other important information. They all have similar stats, mission statements, testing scores, parental/community involvement, etc…but I’m not exactly sure what else I should be looking for.

Of course I, and every other teacher lol, want a supportive administration, good pay/ benefits, and all that good stuff. But what else do I need to be looking for? What questions should I be asking or be prepared to answer? How do I go about nailing my first teaching job other than just being myself? I’m very witty, bubbly, and outgoing and (I honestly hate to toot my own horn) I can make a great impression. I have just a few years under my belt of teaching Pre-K while I was on a medical leave from college. 

My calling is for third grade. I wanted first, but I think third is my perfect match after engaging in more field placements in older elementary ages the past couple of semesters.

I’m fully aware of the negatives surrounding the teaching profession and I’m all in. I’m ready for it all! 

But I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t nervous about this serious transition in my life/ career.

Any information helps! Thank you in advance!"

I'm developing an AI-powered sober coach who provides on-demand service to individuals in active addiction and recent recovery. This project *is not* meant to replace traditional treatment. It's a new tool in our arsenal to help folks who don't have access to traditional treatment.

Background on me. I'm a high achieving dude who ended up wrapped up in the gay meth world for 3 years, before getting sober. I was highly motivated to quit and it took me 2.5 months to get help. Before meth, I worked in advertising selling Coca-Cola's finest sugar waters. After rehab, I did a program at MIT for designing AI systems and products.

While in rehab, I managed to talk the director into letting me use my computer (that was a fun story.) I used it to program my first LLM (like ChatGPT) to deliver the Smart Recovery curriculum to me. I spent an hour or two every night for a week going through the program, and I can say with confidence that I had some of the most intimate discussions about my recovery with the bot.

This is what inspired me to build my current project. A tool that's relatively low-cost, available 24/7, that responds dynamically, whether it's with a bitter teen with marijuana issues or a doctoral student who's about to lose it to heroin. The ultimate goal of the intervention is to move users along the transtheoretical model of change, so that they accept it's time for traditional treatment. I've built a module that uses what the AI has learned about you (location, insurance, individual circumstances,) and matches you with clinics listed in SAMHSA's directory of drug and alcohol treatment centers to provide personalized recs.

There are no tools for people in active addiction. And from my experience in advertising, we need to do a better job of selling the concept of recovery before we ask someone to abstain. We need a lifeline we can toss out to individuals who can't make the leap to rehab—like folks discharged from ERs or when folks can't find a bed.

I'm just curious whether this community would see it as a welcomed tool, or something that challenges something internally. I've been demonstrating the app with folks in the local recovery community. The established folks of a certain age group have been defensive, but the younger guard seems receptive."

# 🕵️‍♂️ OpenAI has a secretive tool to detect AI-generated text

OpenAI has been sitting on a tool that can detect AI-assisted cheating for nearly a year. Using an invisible watermarking technique, the company has developed a tool that can detect ChatGPT-generated text with 99.9% accuracy. However, internal debates about user retention, potential bias, and distribution methods have kept this technology under wraps.

Meanwhile, educators are desperately seeking ways to detect AI misuse in schools. A recent survey found that 59% of middle- and high-school teachers were confident some students had used AI for schoolwork, up 17 points from the previous year.

***Why does it matter?***

This tool could preserve the value of original thought in education. However, OpenAI's hesitation shows there are complex ethical considerations about AI detection and unintended consequences in language communities.

# 🦾OpenAI co-founder leaves for Anthropic

https://preview.redd.it/lpd083gu54hd1.png?width=1118&format=png&auto=webp&s=54d1c98e8360bfc77aeb4c4c58e7e55719575321

Three key leaders at OpenAI are departing or taking leave, including co-founder John Schulman, co-founder Greg Brockman, and Peter Deng — another major shakeup for the AI powerhouse.

* John Schulman, co-founder and a key leader at OpenAI, has left to join rival AI startup Anthropic — one of OpenAI’s biggest competitors.
* Greg Brockman, OpenAI's president and co-founder, is taking an extended leave of absence until the end of the year.
* Peter Deng, a product leader who joined last year from Meta, has reportedly also departed.
* These moves follow other recent high-profile exits, including co-founders Ilya Sutskever and Andrej Karpathy.

OpenAI has struggled to regain its footing after Sam Altman's departure and eventual return as CEO in November 2023. Brockman, one of Altman's biggest supporters during the ousting, mysteriously takes a leave of absence at a crucial time as OpenAI sees increased competition from Anthropic and Meta AI.

# 👀 Tesla's AI gives robots human-like vision

Tesla's latest patent introduces a vision system for autonomous robots, particularly its humanoid robot Optimus. The end-to-end AI model uses only camera inputs to create a detailed 3D understanding of the environment, without using expensive sensors like LiDAR.

By dividing the space into voxels (3D pixels), the system can predict each spatial unit's occupancy, shape, semantics, and motion in real-time. It has already been implemented, with Tesla's manufacturing team training and deploying the neural network in Optimus for tasks like picking up battery cells on a conveyor belt.

***Why does it matter?***

The development of such AI-driven perception technologies could lead to progress in autonomous systems for more sophisticated and reliable operations.

# 💻 Nvidia delays new AI chip launch

The Information reports that design flaws could delay the launch of Nvidia's next-gen AI chips by three months or more. This setback could affect giants like Microsoft, Google, and Meta, who have collectively placed orders worth tens of billions of dollars for these chips.

Despite the rumored delay, Nvidia maintains that production of its new Blackwell chip series is on track. The company also reports strong demand for its Hopper chips and says a broad sampling of Blackwell has already begun. However, sources claim that Microsoft and another major cloud provider were informed of production delays just this week.

***Why does it matter?***

A slowdown in chip availability could hamper the development and deployment of new AI technologies, affecting everything from cloud services to generative AI applications. It also highlights the delicate balance and vulnerabilities in the AI supply chain.

# 🧠 AI turns brain cancer cells into immune cells

Researchers at the Keck School of Medicine of USC used AI to reprogram glioblastoma cells into cancer-fighting dendritic cells. It increased survival chances by up to 75% in mouse models of glioblastoma, the deadliest form of brain cancer in adults. The technique cleverly bypasses the blood-brain barrier by converting cancer cells within the tumor itself, a major hurdle in traditional glioblastoma treatments.

The approach greatly improved survival rates in animal models when combined with existing treatments like immune checkpoint therapy or DC vaccines. The research team aims to begin clinical trials in patients within the next few years

***Why does it matter?***

The technique offers new hope for patients facing this aggressive disease. Moreover, the approach's application to other cancer types suggests a broader impact on cancer immunotherapy, transforming how we approach cancer treatment in the future.

1em43wn,185,2024-08-07,What actually happened in Bangladesh and lessons for India,u/Much_Independent_574,GeopoliticsIndia,https://www.reddit.com/r/GeopoliticsIndia/comments/1em43wn/what_actually_happened_in_bangladesh_and_lessons/,"**Student Protests Over Quota System in Bangladesh**

In Bangladesh, student protests erupted over the perceived unfairness of the quota system in government jobs and educational institutions. The system originally reserved 30% of these opportunities for freedom fighters but was later extended to include the children and grandchildren of freedom fighters, a group that constitutes only about 0.13% of the population. This discrepancy sparked widespread outrage among students, who argued that the quota system was inequitable. 

The intensity of the protests led the government to abolish the quota system in 2018. However, in a controversial turn of events, the High Court of Bangladesh ruled in 2024 that the government's decision to remove the quota system was unconstitutional, thus reinstating it. 

**The Political Underpinnings of Sheikh Hasina's Stance**

Sheikh Hasina, the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, implicitly supported the reservation system. This support was partly driven by political considerations, as the beneficiaries of the quota system were likely to be loyal to her and her family. Sheikh Hasina hails from the family of Mujibur Rahman, the founding leader of Bangladesh and a prominent freedom fighter. By ensuring that a significant portion of government positions were held by descendants of freedom fighters, she could secure a government filled with allies.

On the surface, this might appear as an unfair manipulation of the system. However, the context reveals a more complex rationale. Sheikh Hasina’s entire family was tragically murdered by the extremist group Jamaat-e-Islami, which wields significant influence in Islamic countries, including Bangladesh. There was a legitimate concern that if members of Jamaat-e-Islami occupied even 20% of government seats, they could potentially orchestrate a coup to overthrow her moderate liberal administration and also murder her.

Critics, particularly from left-leaning platforms, will highlight Sheikh Hasina's apparent unfairness in maintaining the quota system but don't discuss the reasons for her support to the reservation system. Her approach was, in part, a defensive measure to prevent extremist elements from gaining power and endangering her government and personal safety, which is exactly what happened.

**The Military Coup and International Dynamics**

Towards the end of this political saga, the military took advantage of the chaotic situation. The military commander, allegedly paid off by the CIA, refused to take orders from Sheikh Hasina, forcing her to flee the country. This move aligns closely with the CIA's historical playbook, which has often involved destabilizing governments deemed unfavorable to U.S. interests.

What intensified the intrigue was the subsequent refusal of the UK and the US to grant political asylum to Sheikh Hasina. These countries, known for offering asylum to various criminal figures—including the Shah of Iran after the Iranian Revolution despite his brutal crackdown on Iranians—denied her refuge. This refusal highlighted a stark contradiction in the asylum policies of these nations, sparking further debate on international political motives and alliances. Anyone who thinks this was a pro-democracy student led protest has their head up their a\*\*. 

  
**Lessons for India**

The events in Bangladesh offer several critical lessons for India, particularly concerning its relationship with the United States:

1. **Reevaluating Ties with the US**: I have been saying this for a long time and will say it again, The US is the worst s\*um on eath country to exist. We need to normalize ties with china ASAP. Go through my comment history and you'll see I have pushed for this.
2. **US Pressure Tactics**: The primary reason for the US to support a more extremist government in Bangladesh is to exert pressure on India. As one of the few sovereign states refusing to toe the US line, India faces a threat. By surrounding India with hostile regimes, the US aims to coerce India into compliance. If India continues to resist, the US will fund terror organizations in India's Northeast, much like how Israel faces threats in its region.
3. **Economic Control**: The US seeks to dominate Indian markets, allowing American companies to run amok and creating a capitalist sh\*t hole like in the US. Additionally, the US wants to ensure India distances itself from Russia and aligns more closely with Western economic and political interests.
4. **Geopolitical Manipulation**: Another significant reason behind US policy is the desire to see India engage in conflict with China. The US, anticipating an inevitable confrontation with China, prefers India to serve as the frontline, thereby weakening China before a direct US engagement. This manipulation positions India as cannon fodder in the broader geopolitical struggle.
5. **Control of Information**: They want to control the indian mind. You might think Ig, FB, Twitter etc are beacons of American free speech but all they are are tools for the US govt to control the narrative in India and control the mind of Indians. Recent example being stand with reasi was pulled down by Ig but stand with Rafah was promoted. They want a certain ideology to prevail. I FULLY suport the banning of such platforms in india. We need a China like ecosystem with indigenously developed social media sites controlled within india and closed off from the rest of the world.

1. **Minimum Wage:** Minimum wage should be adjusted based on the average cost of living in each area. It should be the lowest survivable wage for a single person working 40 hours a week, covering essential needs like food, rent, utilities, basic Wi-Fi, simple phone plans, and transportation.
2. **Social Programs:** Social programs should facilitate ease in obtaining and maintaining employment.
3. **Healthcare:** Implement a public option and regulate the prices of medicines.
4. **Workers' Rights:** Implement unlimited sick days with a doctor's proof, 12 months of maternity and paternity leave, and abolish at-will employment.
5. **Education:** Make college affordable, increase funding for public schools, provide comprehensive sex education for those aged 14 and above, and include US government and election education in the curriculum.

# Social Policy:

1. **LGB:** As a gay individual, I believe banning books that mention gay people is absurd. Preventing high school students from being openly LGBTQ is cruel, and not allowing teachers to stop homophobic bullying is worse. Firing teachers for being openly gay is likely illegal. Banning public drag and LGBTQ events is unconstitutional. Being LGBTQ is not an adults-only subject nor inherently sexual, and the same goes for drag queens and kings.
2. **Transgender Rights:** I fully support trans youth in seeking therapy, puberty blockers, HRT, and social transition for their mental health. For adults, there should be no restrictions on changing the gender on birth certificates, IDs, and driver's licenses. There should also be a non-binary gender option.
3. **Abortion:** Abortion should be safe, legal, and rare.
4. **Drugs:** We need infrastructure to help addicts get clean and employed. Instead of imprisoning them, we should build recovery centers to rehabilitate and reintegrate them into society. Distribution should still lead to prison, but marijuana should be legal.
5. **Police Reform:** Overhaul the police system with different sections for mental health crises, violent incidents, and non-violent incidents. Require working body cameras, and mandate 6 months to a year of training for officers.

# Election Reform:

1. **Voter Registration:** Implement same-day automatic voter registration to ensure that all eligible citizens can vote without facing bureaucratic obstacles. This will increase voter participation and ensure that every voice is heard.
2. **Voting Process:** Make mail-in voting easy and accessible to all voters. This includes providing pre-paid return envelopes, ensuring timely delivery and processing of ballots, and establishing secure drop-off locations.
3. **Infrastructure:** Modernize election infrastructure to ensure efficiency, security, and accessibility. This includes upgrading voting machines, securing digital systems against cyber threats, and ensuring that polling places are equipped to handle all voters, including those with disabilities.
4. **Holiday Week:** Designate the week of the election as a holiday week to allow all citizens ample opportunity to vote without work or time constraints. This can increase voter turnout and reduce long lines and wait times at polling places.
5. **Redistricting:** Establish a citizen-led independent redistricting commission to draw electoral district boundaries. This will help eliminate gerrymandering and ensure fair representation for all communities.
6. **Funding:** Increase funding for elections and election security to ensure that all aspects of the election process are adequately supported. This includes training for election workers, maintaining secure voting environments, and educating the public about voting procedures.
7. **Early Voting:** Make early voting easier and more accessible with extended periods and multiple locations.

Privilege naman sila and mayaman but I'm just really shocked sa mga nalalaman ko about my cousin.

I helped with her assignments before, part of which is kasi nahuli siya ng teacher niya na ChatGPT lang yung mga tasks niya. Sinabi ko naman na tutulungan ko siya for now, since I have a lot of time before I go to uni. Nakakainis lang sa part na I have to spoonfed her the answers all the time, parang wala na rin siyang gana mag-aral at all. Worse, hindi siya marunong mag-add! Add na hindi rin siya gumamit ng Word / Google Docs napapakamot na lang talaga ako kung paano niya nalagpasan yung Elem niya nung pandemic. Oh, did I mention na With Honors siya last year? This is ridiculous! Ganto na ba kababa ang standard ng some schools ngayon or hindi lang sila nagfofocus sa natututunan ng mga estudyante nila? 

Bulakbol din naman ako nung bata ako, but not to the point na hindi ko kaya hanapin sa YouTube yung problema ko.

ChatGPT, a state-of-the-art language processing AI, offers a personalized, interactive, and scalable approach to learning, marking a shift from traditional, often passive learning experiences.

In corporate settings, onboarding and continuous professional development are crucial for maintaining a competitive edge. ChatGPT facilitates this by providing tailored learning materials, engaging employees with conversational knowledge checks, and adapting to individual learning paces. Its 24/7 availability ensures that training sessions can be accessed at any time, thereby accommodating diverse schedules and work environments. This flexibility leads to better resource management and a decrease in training costs.

Educational institutions can also harness the power of ChatGPT to supplement classroom teaching. By integrating ChatGPT into their learning management systems, they can offer students additional support with homework, clarify complex topics through interactive discussions, and foster a deeper understanding of the subject matter. ChatGPT can also serve as a tool for language learning, directly conversing with students in the target language, thus providing immersive and practical language practice.

Furthermore, the use of ChatGPT in virtual learning environments facilitates personalized feedback and grading, allowing educators to devote more time to curriculum development and one-on-one student mentoring. This greatly enhances the overall educational experience.

However, as we embrace ChatGPT in learning and development, it's essential to address potential challenges such as ensuring the AI's responses are accurate and unbiased, maintaining engagement in the absence of human interaction, and protecting user data.

What are your thoughts on this transformation? Have you experienced ChatGPT's impact on learning firsthand? Share your experiences and insights on how ChatGPT could further revolutionize corporate and educational training."

I'm a researcher working on large language models (LLMs) and techniques like fine-tuning to improve their performance on downstream tasks for non-computer science domain. While transformers have revolutionized NLP with their self-attention mechanisms, I find myself facing a different kind of attention challenge: effectively communicating these complex ML concepts to non-technical stakeholders, such as:

* Funding agencies and grant committees 
* Students in introductory AI/ML courses
* Business leaders and product managers

I'm looking for great examples of visualizations, animations, analogies, etc. that help explain things like:

* What LLMs are and how they work at a high-level
* The impact of fine-tuning on LLM performance 
* Improvements achieved by fine-tuning for specific applications

The goal is to create compelling materials for funding proposals, lectures, and other situations where I need to direct audience attention and convey the core concepts to those without ML expertise.

If you've come across any projects, blog posts, videos, or papers that do this well, please share them! I'd really appreciate learning from the examples and techniques others have developed. Links to repos with code for generating visualizations would also be fantastic.

Thanks in advance for any guidance and pointers! Let me know if any other details would be helpful."

OpenAI-backed startup Figure AI just showed off Figure 02, its next-generation AI-powered humanoid robot — capable of completely autonomous work in complex environments like a BMW factory.

* Figure 02 uses OpenAI’s AI models for speech-to-speech reasoning, allowing the humanoid robot to have full conversations with humans.
* A Vision Language Model (VLM) enables the robot to make quick, common-sense decisions based on visual input and self-correct errors.
* Six RGB cameras provide the robot with 360-degree vision to help it navigate the real world.
* The robot stands 5'6""and weighs 132 lbs, with a 44 lb lifting capacity and a 20-hour runtime thanks to a custom 2.25 KWh battery pack.

The humanoid robot race is intensifying, with Figure CEO Brett Adcock claiming that Figure 02 is now the “most advanced humanoid on the planet"" — a direct challenge toward Elon Musk and Tesla Optimus. While the world now waits for Elon’s response, Figure has one ace up its sleeve: its OpenAI partnership.

# 🦄 TikTok creator challenges OpenAI Sora

https://preview.redd.it/qito78oqmahd1.png?width=1292&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a927b1ec9b1cfd03c1e74f45bd3e2a1ea679ab0

ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, just launched Jimeng AI for Chinese users, a text-to-video AI app that directly competes with OpenAI’s (unreleased) Sora AI video model.

* Jimeng AI is available on the Apple App Store and Android for Chinese users.
* ByteDance's entry into the AI video generation market follows similar launches by other Chinese tech firms, including Kuaishou's Kling AI.
* The subscription, priced at 79 yuan ($11) monthly or 659 yuan ($92) annually allows for the creation of \~2,050 images or 168 AI videos per month.
* Unlike OpenAI's Sora, which isn't yet publicly available, these models by Jimeng AI are already accessible to users (in China).

China's AI video generation race is accelerating, with Kling AI's public release just weeks ago and now ByteDance's Jimeng AI launching while the world anxiously waits for Sora's public release. With Jimeng AI being backed by TikTok, it will have plenty of training data and deep pockets to compete against other AI giants.

# 🧪 New AI can listen while speaking

https://preview.redd.it/dulcm59smahd1.png?width=1292&format=png&auto=webp&s=f54d32c45ba93d9c18ec3f1001a2727f42ed37f4

AI researchers just developed a new Listening-While-Speaking Language Model (LSLM) that can listen and speak simultaneously — advancing real-time, interactive speech-based AI conversations.

* The new model, called the Listening-while-Speaking Language Model (LSLM), enables full-duplex modeling in interactive speech-language models.
* LSLM uses a token-based decoder-only TTS for speech generation and a streaming self-supervised learning encoder for real-time audio input.
* The system can detect turn-taking in real-time and respond to interruptions, a key feature of natural conversation.
* The model demonstrated robustness to noise and sensitivity to diverse instructions in experiments.

While OpenAI's recent Her-like [advanced voice mode](https://www.therundown.ai/p/openai-begins-chatgpt-voice-rollout?) for ChatGPT inches us toward realistic AI conversations, LSLM leaps even further by enabling AI to process incoming speech WHILE talking. This could revolutionize human-AI interactions — making conversations with machines feel truly natural and responsive.

 ""The method **consist in** giving the student a personal teaching that adapts to him and permits him to develop himself as a good citizen and learner.""  

I only have Chatgpt as corrector because i dont have money and he says that in this phrase ""consist in"" is incorrect and it should be ""consist of"" the explanation he gave me is that

Consist of is for talking about the parts that compound the thing 

Consist in is for talking about the essence or main principle of the thing

Both parents went there, made lifelong friends, had the best times of their lives, and gained many impactful connections because of this school. Fast forward to my freshman year of high school, I was turned on by the fact that my college guidance counselor doubted my ability to get into $%&. I completed only the bare minimum for every category of strength on my resume. I ensured I got a 90% or above on every course I took to get the best GPA and rank but my method of doing it was sleezy. Because my high school was new and small I was friends with almost all of my teachers who were more than willing to negotiate with me on getting scores better than I deserved. I procrastinated until the LAST second, I wasn't passionate about a single topic and I pretty much forgot about every important topic or piece of knowledge I learned. I only studied to ace an exam and not to actually learn or care. I abused AI so much that I aced two community college courses completely -to boost my class rank- using ChatGPT and none of my own words. I learned nothing except how to thoughtfully cheat. Not to mention the accommodations I absolutely abused even though I don't have an actual learning disability I'm aware of. Even the leadership aspect of my resume is BS: I was captain for three of our sports teams throughout the years including basketball, cross country, and ultimate frisbee. The only reason I was captain was because I'm 6'6"" and our school has no sports influence. Our teams were actual ass in all sports except ultimate. I was one of the student body co-presidents which is an anomaly only accepted by a tiny school and I only got elected through pure popularity. I didn't do a single productive thing during my time as the president. I sat there and watched my co (who is actually a genius) do everything for me. I was even elected as the president of the Habitat for Humanity Club, however, other than attracting more members and doing very little service work myself, I did nothing. Yet, I got into all five prestigious colleges I applied to and the National Honor Society. I'm sitting here now a week before I attend $%& not knowing a damn thing I learned in high school contemplating my life and how unfair it is to other people. About how I ranked no. 2 in my grade and didn't give a single shit. Not to mention, I'm an idiot with the IQ of an average truck driver who is terrible at math and wants to pursue computer science. It's a sad joke. My entire career is proof of how embarrassing the U.S.'s scholastic and education system is and now I don't know what to do."
1emmpnt,1,2024-08-07,Helping My Friend (24M) Who Is Falsely Accused Of SA By His Relative,u/friendaccusedofsa,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1emmpnt/helping_my_friend_24m_who_is_falsely_accused_of/,"**You might want to use Chat GPT/Gemini to summarise this as this is going to be very long.**

In long: My friend was born in Spring 2000 in HCMC Vietnam as an only child to two physicians (both 63) who are my mother's close friends during medical school. His mother had several older siblings living in the US, so when her I-485 was approved in the early 2000s, they then moved to Boston in 2003, where the father had to take the physician residency program to become a certified physician, and the mother worked at a Vietnamese restaurant learning English to make ends meet and got an accounting degree at a community college. They even relied on rental property in Vietnam to make a living during this turbulent era, of which their main house in Vietnam was rented off to my friend's mother's parents, of whom the father died in 2013 at 89 and the mother died in 2018 at 92. It took them about 5 years, but after the father finished his residency, he became a full-fledged physician in the South Shore and his wife became an accountant.

However, due to the fact my friend started speaking at 4, lacked social skills, and stimmed, he was diagnosed with autism in 2004, and his life was uprooted since. Ever since he was diagnosed with autism (his parents claimed they knew nothing about autism when he was diagnosed), his family has been abusive towards him, and he has been siphoned as the black sheep/scapegoat. His father even resorted to physical abuse whenever he stimmed and due to this, he has never been particularly close to his father but is somewhat closer to his mother. My friend reminisced that his parents thought that due to his autism (tu ky) diagnosis, that he might not be able to support himself and that he would have no future. Turns out, he could support himself and he has lived independently from them since 17 and that he has taught himself how to shower at 8, brush his teeth at 6, eat by himself at 6, do the laundry and fold the clothes at 13, and wash the dishes/cook frozen food at 13. He even taught himself to tie his shoes at around 10, and even though the first few times, he required intervention from teachers/friends, he finally got the hang of it. He has claimed his parents never taught him chores or how to survive and that he has taught himself everything to live independently. He even said he abandoned training wheels at 8 and started biking two wheels and during college, he mostly commuted around Boston by bike, but at 7, he fell at a park while riding a two-wheel 20"" bike, so he was frightened and had to continue using training wheels. During his early childhood, he was suspected to have been a picky eater, only eating fast food and avoiding rice possibly due to being traumatized by rice, but after 6 when he was accustomed to eating rice, he has since craved Asian food during his adolescence and adulthood.

Despite the fact his family never believed in him due to him having autism, he nonetheless started his intellectual life at around 5. Despite the fact he was denied from kindergarten due to 'lack of maturity' and was forced into special education due to being on an IEP despite turning 5 months before the cutoff, he still nonetheless was intellectually motivated, having started reading dozens of short stories like Mickey Mouse, SpongeBob, etc. (based on the family videos about him) at around 4-5, and having started learning addition, subtraction, and the times/division tables by then. He has also read a picture book depicting other countries/continents where he has learnt of countries like Russia, Mongolia, China, Japan, Korea, France, Germany, UK, US, Canada, etc., and he was also given times tables, presidents, solar system, US states, and global map placemats, where he memorised all 43 presidents (at the time) and 50 US states, plus their respective capitals, at the time he was 7 (based on his testimony and my experiences with him). Now because his GPs lived in Vietnam, his parents visit Vietnam each summer for about a month until 2013 (when he was 13 and I was 12) and due to this, I got to hang out with him as a child, and due to this, I knew he was ""Wicked Smaht"". We would delve on for hours going into intellectual discussions as well as discussing about technology/computers (as 10-year-olds), and ever since we were children, we have dreamt of starting a tech company together and becoming successful in the US. His grandparents are actually adjacent to my parent's house, so we are neighbours, but similar to him, I later moved to the US at 11 (I did move out of Vietnam into Eastern Europe to be raised by relatives at 5 and attend a private school there), and afterwards, became an LPR and subsequently, USC just a few years ago. His parents even bought him a picture dictionary at 6 (Kindergarten) and he would spend hours reading it (the whole thing even), learning new vocab and he is particularly interested in the cars section as well as the computer/mobile phone section and in that picture dictionary, it even teaches about US History and there is also a world map and list of countries.

Even though my friend literally learnt no social skills whatsoever in SPED, once he was 7 in 1st, he was lifted from SPED and he was 100% mainstreamed. During 1st grade, he developed a passion for computers and Windows operating systems, with him being so excited his parents got him a Windows Vista machine and with him wanting to be the administrator of his new computer, of which he gets to use for one hour a day. There, he discovered the likes of YouTube, FaceBook, Google, etc, and despite the fact his parents never allowed him on the internet before then, he is now on the internet, and ""computer time"" was the best time in his life. He even started learning about older operating systems such as Windows 95, 3.1, etc, by then. During this time, whenever we socialised, we both talked about computers and PC/Mac games, and later on at 8, he discovered software such as Microsoft VPC2007, VMware, etc, and he started to discover Linux on his own by the time. By 9, he then started basic HTML and by 11, JS/Python coding, mostly using YouTube, and despite the fact he sorta struggled in the JS and Python a little bit, he got the hang of it at around 12 years old. He also got his share in wanting to develop mobile apps along with me, so he was given a hand-me-down iPhone 3GS from his father in 2012 to develop mobile apps with me, as I would usually invite him to my house in Boston and we would code together during the day. Despite the fact he knew much of the syntax of JS and Python up to the intermediate level (Hello World, strings, arithmetic, if else statements, for, while, do loops, lists, tuples, def, dictionaries, sets, classes, etc,) he suffered from mental illness since he was 12 and therefore, was never able to fully entrench his programming knowledge and learnt about algorithms, and hence in college, he floundered in computer science and had to resort to switching to information technology/science. At 12 (2012), he and I (11 at the time) both created a website, with him dealing with HTML/CSS and me dealing with JavaScript and the backend Python, and we also worked together on building a home server of 3 computers with one running Windows Server 2008 R2 and the other two running Windows 7 and Vista.

As for academics, his social skills and behavior started to rise during 1st grade when he was completely put in gened, and in 2nd grade (he was 8 years old), he started loving non-fiction chapter books, of which he was given a high school world history and US history textbook from his teacher and he would spend hours skimming through the book and learning of many historical events. He even started to read Wikipedia articles as well as the Encyclopedia Britannica and by the time he was 8, he already knew of events such as the 116 Year's War, the French and Napoleon Revolution, the First Crusade, the Magna Carta, the Black Plague, the Industrial Revolution, Aztecs, etc, and started being exposed to people such as Su Sung, Thomas of Aquinas, Jan Hus, Rabelais, Erasmus, Brahe, Kepler, Hobbes, Descartes, Kant, Rousseau, Haydn, Darwin, Empress Dowager, Nikola Tesla, Max Planck/Born, Neils Bohr, Charles De Gaulle, etc, and by this same time, he also started discovering about science subjects as well, such as Biology, Life/Earth Sciences, Chemistry, and Physics. Despite being slightly behind in reading comprehension and writing as he is not so interested in reading fiction books compared to other subjects, he was nonetheless average compared to people of his age and grade cohort, and he has slightly above average vocabulary by then. Most importantly, he started to learn 3rd and 4th grade math using some of the workbooks his parents bestowed to him and he actually got as far as subtracting/multiplying fractions and long division. By 8 years old, similar to me, he started to show his ambition and determination to attend an Ivy Tier school, such as HYPSM, etc. Therefore, when his parents wanted to build a new McMansion in an upper-middle class WASP suburb in the South Shore (below the likes of Newton, Sudbury, Dover, Weston, Wellesley, Lexington, Carlisle, Belmont, etc, and on par with Lynnfield, Boxford, Marblehead, Holliston, Natick, etc), he objected to it and instead, opted to look for areas with competitive schools.

In the beginning of 3rd grade, due to teacher recommendation, he was placed in 4th grade math (in my POV, it is not ""advanced"" like the school was claiming as he turned 9 well before 3rd grade started). He even joined in the 4th grade class for the whole day and actually thrived, scoring constant A's in science and social studies quizzes/tests, but for some reason, the principal didn't authorise of him skipping to 4th despite his age due to his ""average"" reading comprehension/English skills, so he had to stay in the 3rd grade for English, Science, and Social Science, which made him kinda bored, but nonetheless, he did thrive in math, where he was placed in a 4th grade class. In 3rd grade, his elementary school changed from a 1-5 grading scale to an A-F grading scale, and despite receiving mostly A in math, science, social studies, music, and art and a B in English, based on his report card (I actually did see his report card from 3rd grade to last semester of college), he received an A in conduct/effort in every single class all the way up to the end of 5th grade. At home, he self taught 5/6 grade math, and by 4th grade (age 10), he taught himself 7/8 grade math, which essentially meant Pre-Algebra, and by this point, he even claimed that on one of the tests, he was the only person (as a 4th grader) to pass a 5th grade math test, at a 97. Every other 5th grader had to redo the test as from what he claimed, they scored below a 70. At school meanwhile, he won the school's math competition and was inducted to compete against the county and then the state.

In 5th grade, he started to learn Algebra on his own and started to read middle/high school biology, chemistry, physics, astronomy, environmental science, etc, and he started to develop an obsession in finding extraterrestrial planets in different galaxies such as Andromeda, etc. By this time, he already knew concepts such as galaxy clusters, white/brown dwarfs, supernovas, half-life, quarks/gluons, isotopes, covalent bonds, fission/fusion, force/motion/gravity, UV/gamma rays, electromagnetism, the electromagnetic spectrum, conservation of energy, Lewis Diagrams, etc. He also won an engineering fair project where he competed with the Boston area but ultimately failed, but ever since then, he has vowed to try out another time to compete in ISEF, but never got the opportunity to as he moved to another district. Despite that, due to the fact he had very few friends and is mostly gregarious towards slightly older people (similar to me), he had trouble making any friends and he actually did get reprimanded at school for attempting to befriend a Chinese boy who is also academically gifted, but it ultimately failed. Unfortunately, lunch bunch didn't really help much as he felt stigmatized due to 'hanging out with bad behaviour people', and as a result, his social cues were kinda weak at the time (they did improve throughout the years however with intervention from his parents), and he was reprimanded for 'following' this particular Chinese boy even if he didn't want to befriend him. His only friend (and also crush) is a Vietnamese girl who allegedly has the same first name as the cousin in question who is now accusing him of SA.

But the golden ages did abruptly stall as his parents grew tired of living in a ""small"" 3 bedroom 1000 sqft house and decided to upsize. So, in 2012, they then bought a 5000 sqft McMansion, claimed they can't afford Newton/Lexington/Belmont despite the fact they not only could buy a 1500 sqft house in Brookline/Cambridge as well (two of the most expensive housing markets in the Boston area and comparable to their home's value), and then effectively forced him to move to a ""more socially conservative"" town where 95% of residents are white and only 1% is Asian-American. They also upsized their car from a used 1999 Toyota Camry they bought in 2003 to a new Mercedes Benz S Class/Lexus RX upon upgrading their house. That same time, my friend's cousin and I moved to America where she was in the 9th grade, I was in the 7th grade, and she and I both attended the same school (a Harvard University feeder close to Boston that he dreamt of attending). In fact, I took Algebra II during 7th grade and during math class, I would often be transferred to the high school to take the course, and based on my testimony, she is about class average (B+/A-) at best in Algebra II. I was also in the same math class with her during Pre-Calculus (8/10) and Calculus (9/11) and based on my testimony, she is socially reserved, only talking with a few very intimate friends, and despite the fact she is quite ambitious, her ambitions are nowhere close to her younger cousin or I, as she only planned to become a surgeon doctor anywhere in the US and possibly open a practice rather than change the world, and plus, she doesn't care about university prestige.

Due to the fact they effectively moved to another school district, he had to switch schools, and therefore, he didn't receive the same advantages as he did in the previous school district. In the previous school district, he actually qualified for Algebra I during the 6th grade year (2012), but upon switching schools after 5th grade graduation where he was celebrated as one of the top students, there was an IEP meeting, and unfortunately, due to the fact he will be forced into SPED for much of the day, he was crying throughout as he loathed SPED during his kindergarten/PreSchool and thrived in mainstream. The IEP meeting claimed that the ""teacher"" would help ""accelerate"" his math/science and other strong points, but instead, the opposite happened. During the beginning of 6th, he was put in a 6-8 special ed homeroom with 15 students (5 per grade) with 1 teacher and 6 paraeducators, and he has felt out of place and depressed. When seeing the 15 students, all of them seemed to have worse behaviour, be pulled out of class for behavioural reasons, and have ""far worse"" academic performance and have some cognitive impairments and he felt like he is more similar to a neurotypical student than anybody in special ed. Even worse, there are microaggressions by the paraeducators, where even with the smallest ""problems"", he would be reprimanded. Even if he were to socialise with girls at class, he would be reprimanded. There are two paraeducators that will follow around the 5 students in each grade, including him all day long, and due to this, it has led to hostility between him and neurotypical peers during lunch, recess, or Art/Music/Gym/TechEng, where he gets to interact with neurotypical students. Even though nobody has told him or his parents the reason why he should be in special ed, I think it stems with the fact he didn't have any friends during elementary (before I immigrated to the US) and therefore, he had to resort to ""following"" a Chinese boy to befriend him, but that is purely my speculation, I really don't know what is going on here. But this did backfire, as not only was he depressed during school, he was also peer pressured into NSFW topics, and once he was suggested to stuff like sex, drugs, etc, he was disgusted by this, and his parents are too. So, they ended up contacting the ISP to censor all NSFW content (kind of like schools) so he couldn't be able to access those websites. Due to the fact he couldn't really socialise with girls at school due to those microaggressions from aides, he resorted to contacting them on social media just like he contacted boys, but even though some girls did respond, others hated him to the point some even claimed harassment even if the conversation is shallow, and it has caused a warning from the principal's office despite the fact my friend only wanted to befriend them just like other neurotypical folks.

During this time, at home, he has been abused back and forth by his father. I have visited several family gatherings and not only were they more affectionate towards the cousin, but family members were also straight up ""colder"" towards him and me, using a more commanding rather than soft/friendly tone, and I have witnessed my friend being chased and gagged by his father, with the whole family siding with my father, but me even threatening to call the police, of which even though the father was let go by the police after ""apologising"", it still conveyed the hostility between my friend and his family. I even witnessed my friend's father having a violent outburst towards me and threatened to chase me, as well as him throwing bottles at his wife, with the son trying to comfort her, and from what I see, I absolutely felt disgusted by my friend's family and would prefer that he meets at my place. Now even if my friend's parents never would admit this, I actually saw documents stating that they helped foot the bill towards my friend's cousin's high school tuition, rent in Cambridge during high school, rent in Brookline during college, and even a new BMW after high school. Luckily my friend didn't know this (he only inferred this is the case). If he knew anything about this, he would have been even more jealous of his cousin and more ferocious of his parents for blatant favouritism. There was one time his father pushed him down the stairs during an argument and it required hospitalization, but then, the father was let go with a fine. Despite some hardships at home, my friend remained calm and despite being kinda short tempered (like me), he is not violent towards family members, and is instead, terrified of prison. As good as the parents are in social engineering, claiming that ""affluent Boston suburbs"" are ""too expensive, have too much traffic and crime, etc"", my friend was still not fond of the place he lived between 2012-7.

During 6th grade, even though he was in special ed for much of the day, in the middle of the year, when his parents petitioned that he'd be in Gened, the school let him be mainstreamed, albeit he has to be followed by a paraeducator, which made him labelled as ""special needs"" in the eyes of neurotypical classmates. When he attended mainstream English, Math, Science, and Social Science, he found out special ed was chapters behind. If you could recall, he passed 6th grade math the year before with an A and qualified for Algebra if he stayed in the same district. In this district, not only did they make him repeat 6th grade math, he was even put in a special ed ""remedial"" math class. During 7th grade when the entire special ed homeroom was put in mainstream classes (they and him are still in special ed homerooms by the way), despite receiving straight A (even in English, his weaker point), his grades slumped dramatically, with him receiving A-/B+ grades in math, science, and social science and with him receiving a B-/C+ in English, mainly due to depression. It did improve during the 3rd quarter of 7th grade however, and during 7th grade, he managed to win an engineering fair the 2nd time, competing against the state, and he actually competed with the county on the NatGeoBee as well. In 8th grade, his grades improved and by then, he has received straight A/A+ in math, science/social science and a B+ in English, and despite the fact he was denied from a foreign language because he was on an IEP and had to take a resource class instead, he nonetheless gained admission and not only caught up with the students who have taken foreign language in 7th grade, but actually eclipsed them, becoming one of the top students in his foreign language class.

However, despite all of this and despite the fact he is seen as well behaved at school (according to his peers), he was actually suspended for two weeks for something totally outside of school as one of his bullies created a fake account impersonating him to ""reach out"" to the girls who filed harassment reports against him (according to my friend and his parents). His parents ""cried"" in the meeting, and on the day he was suspended, the principal even called the police during the suspension despite the fact they could easily handle the situation and it furthered the strain on my friend. One police came to both his house and school and seized all of his electronics including his computers and phones as well as controlled the ISP at his home, he can't help but think that his life is just being screwed up entirely. Despite the fact the internet is heavily censored and my friend didn't have access to a SIM card until about 15 (a year after this incident), somehow, the police still accused him of wanting to become a mass murderer and terrorist despite evidence against it (in fact, if anything, videos about Ted Bundy, Jeffrey Dahmer, Unabomber, etc, are essentially just trending and he has no intentions to harm anybody as he suffered repeated harm himself). They also deleted his coding projects making him not want to learn programming or build up his programming skills anymore, and they as well as the school admins explicitly told him they don't want to see him learning about technology or pursuing into it. If anything, school admins/police/townies are skeptical about the latest technology, the internet, and EVs, and by this time, they have extensive control over his private life, where his IP is essentially spied on ever since then, which further traumatized him, kinda like a police state. From what I heard based on other neurodivergent students, this school has a poor track record when it comes with taking care of neurodivergent students and racial minorities, and many NDs feel traumatized by the persecution and discrimination they face at the school, but as potentially the only Asian student in the grade, especially one who is passionate about computers, like me, he felt even worse. What made it even sadder was that several months after, he was just having a regular school day, and suddenly, due to the fact he was forced to visit the school psychologist as part of his IEP, the school ""psychologist"" who likened him to being schizophrenic due to dreaming of skipping grades and living in Boston, etc, ended up sending him to the principal, where the principal called the police, accused him of ""committing grave offences"" and then the police took every word, and just arrested him at school without any evidence, and held him in a cell for a day despite not doing anything. Once he was released, his mental health took a nosedive, and he even spent about a week at my place trying to run away so my older sisters and I could comfort him. Unfortunately, moving out is an endeavour because the house is at least 10 miles away from an MBTA station and to add to more insult, the parents refused to give my friend any allowance, so he couldn't easily get out, and even if he'd had a job, his parents would still take his income away and gaslighted him about the ""one vacations every year, healthy food, etc"", even if his safety is at a detriment. Then one day after the last day of middle school, when my friend was seen in his father's Mercedes Benz S Class, despite never receiving a trespassing warrant, principals threatened to call police on him where the police then threatened arrest on him once again in the town and during early-summer 2015, he received a creepy call from a Canadian number which actually turned out to be the principal of the school. He was so frightened that he wanted to just run away from his parent's house and permanently move to Boston to live with my sisters and I, but my sisters don't want him to move in.

Now during the middle of 8th grade, due to the parents agreeing that public school has been ""awful"", they decided to apply to a Catholic high school, despite having money to send him to the school his cousin and I attended so we could be classmates. He objected to this plan, claiming that several people who bullied and peer pressured him actually will attend the Catholic school for the 9th grade. Turns out, his parents manipulated him, claiming the school has ""exemplary academics, and that many of their managers attended the school before becoming doctors/accountants/director of hospital department, etc"", and even though the school was ranked highly, it is nowhere near as prestigious as the private school his cousin or I attended, despite him really dreaming of skipping/testing out of 9th grade and starting 10th grade there. They even proceeded to gaslight him that he is ""ahead of his cousin"" and that he would graduate high school before, despite the fact the cousin is 18 months older than him (she was born in early October 1998) and 3 grades ahead, even though in reality, that never happened, and he slid further behind. They even claimed that she was held back a grade despite it never happened, all to manipulate him. In fact, at my school, the SSAT is required, but my friend's parents denied him from taking the SSAT, and instead, forced him to take the HSPT and once admitted to the Catholic high school, he told me he was bullied from DAY 1, starting from just a few students to literally the whole entire grade as students mostly come from the same county or region and congregate during sports events, so they already sorta know him. He started developing depression and despite the fact he was in all honors, he received mostly B and B+ grades during the first three quarters. However in Algebra II honors and Foreign Language, he received an A and he was self-studying Geometry and Trigonometry at home (however, without any credits as it is essentially just a workbook). Even though during the third quarter he received straight A after he got himself together, it was too late as the bullying was so grave, he was expelled despite the fact he was a victim of bullying.

Here is an excerpt: Some of his classmates created fake social media accounts trying to impersonate him. In it, they tried to introduce him to the dark web/illegal content and despite the fact he is very against child p and knew it was illegal and wanted to take down a particular Instagram account which gained >100k followers from Russia, the bullies went unpunished and some even graduated top of the class and went onto Ivy Leagues before landing at FAANG companies whilst he ended up being expelled even though the school has seen no evidence on his devices nor had they checked his bullies' phones. By this time, he has been quite gregarious towards the 11th/12th graders and mostly communicated with them at school and frankly, it was the 9th/10th graders who bullied him. He started at a random online school (kinda like Keystone) where he finished the 2nd half of 9th grade and proceeded to start 10th grade in June where he finished that in November 2016 plus the 11th grade by about April 2017, and he actually proceeded to start the 12th grade where he took AP Calculus AB (the highest the online school offers), and he actually finished 12th grade in about September 2017 and subsequently graduated from high school. He received all A except in English Language Arts, where he got mostly B+/A- grades, and he has taken about 8 AP courses, including APHUG, APUSH, AP US Government, AP Economics, AP Physics 1, AP Biology, AP Chinese, and AP Calculus AB. His school offered 0 computer science courses whatsoever and wouldn't let him take courses outside of school for credit, so the electives had to be at the online school. However, despite the fact his online school was limited, he loved online school and wished he had done it earlier to skip a grade or 2. He took the SAT once in March 2017 with an 800 in math and a 480 in reading, and during AMC 12 in February 2017, he actually passed to the point he qualified for AIME (I took that same AMC test and was in the same room with him and I qualified for USAMO). By the time he graduated from high school, he ran away from home with about $20 selling his old iPod to a pawn shop, used the money for the MBTA commuter rail, and couchsurfed with Vietnamese friends in Dorchester before finding a sub-$1000 studio apartment somewhere in Chelsea/Everett/Revere/Lynn/Winthrop/East Boston during Summer of 2018 as he is tired of living with roommates.

At home however, things took a very strange turn in Summer of 2016. If you can recall, his cousin was treated considerably better by his own parents than him and his parents even gaslighted him that his cousin was still in 11th grade in 2015 and would not graduate in 2016. Turns out, even his cousin directly told him in May of 2016 that she was heading to the 11th grade in 2016 (the grade I was at during the time). However, none of that was actually true as I did attend the 2016 commencement, and she was one of the graduates (albeit she graduated with medium rather than high honors, a 720M, 660W, and 650E SAT score (in other words, a 2030) and she is nowhere close to being a valedictorian). Now due to his family using social engineering to manipulate him, he strongly believed that his cousin was still in 11th grade. However, something was very off, based on his mind. You see, school was supposed to end in early-June, but for her and other 12th graders, it ended in the middle of May. Seeing that she is literally only 18 months but is three years ahead academically, he knew that she had already graduated and with him seeing graduation photos, he had seen his worst fears. So during the whole summer, he started to develop considerable jealousy towards the cousin whilst she was away vacationing in Europe for a month due to a litany of reasons such as being far ahead of him academically, getting to travel to Europe, Dubai, etc, by herself, having special treatment from family members, getting to live by herself in a luxury condo in the epicentre of education at a young age, being bestowed a BMW, and taking care of herself, and despite the jealousy, his parents still didn't help him mitigate the issue by buying a condo for him in Boston to compensate for the injuries they inflicted upon him in suburbia, and instead, they made it worse. From what I have seen, he has FaceTimed her around 5-10 times trying to vent his frustration at her for being privileged and spoiled, but that didn't end well, as she claimed he was harassing her and wanted to completely cut contact with him. Upon hearing that, I even proceeded to talk to her and told her to knock it off and to understand him more as he struggles, but she still blocked my number and changed her phone number to something I don't even know. Ever since 2016, even though I am very much still in contact with him, due to the problem with his cousin, my two sisters (34 and 23 as of 2024) both avoided him like the plague, and my friend went NC with everybody in the family besides his parents and then the year after, with his parents as well. His father than regretted being so short tempered and decided to be more 'calm' but with all the damage done, he could never see his son again. It was kinda too late for his father to start loving him. However, they still wired about $100 a week to him (that only started after college started) and he still accepted it. However, he just doesn't meet them anymore and is terrified being around them.

Even though since September 2017 he has tried to rebuild his life, effectively borrowing money just so he could be able to afford living in Boston since his parents refused to give him any financial support for at least a year due to the fact he ran away and emancipated, he still had to work at a local McDonalds to make ends meet. By this time, he started to regain his programming skills, one by one, and even attended several school tours at BU and Northeastern but since his cousin was a student at the time at one of those universities and one of her friends spotted him despite the fact he had no contact with his cousin for a while as she plugged all of her social media profiles and went for a pseudonym, he was still nonetheless contacted by police but all the charges were dropped after he contacted a lawyer. By the time, he developed PTSD, anxiety, and depression due to the fact his cousin still lived in Boston, and therefore, he was so paranoid of transferring that when he started college in January of 2018, his grades had slumped to like a 3.1 average for the first three semesters (where he got a C to B- in 100 and 200-level CS courses). Despite the fact he got decent grades in AP Physics 1, he also received a D+ in Calculus based Physics mainly due to debilitating PTSD/anxiety/depression, and he actually struggled in Calculus II/Linear Algebra where he has been getting B+ grades. If we were to aggregate his GPA, it goes as follows, and keep in mind, he attended a less selective state school where the acceptance rate is 80%:

Spring 2018-Spring 2019 (average GPA 3.1 CS major)

He felt like he struggled with CPTSD/anxiety/depression as well as tough financial circumstances, so he switched over to Information Technology

Fall 2019 (IT major, 200 level IT courses): 3.5

Ever since Spring 2020 until Fall 2021 when he graduated in December (COVID era): 3.9

Despite not being a club president or anything and despite failing to start an IT club for 5 consecutive semesters due to funding cuts at the school, he nonetheless was only member of the CS and math club. He has learnt to forget about his cousin despite his cousin living in Brookline (near Boston) and moved on, but really feared for his safety living in Boston and coexisting with toxic relatives. However, due to his low GPA and the fact he had a long and confusing Vietnamese name, he never received any callbacks and is essentially ghosted, even in the most simple internships, of which some don't even require college education. He was even ghosted from Best Buy in 2019. So, even though his parents wouldn't let him build a computer nor drive a car, he actually saved up money from McDonalds to not only buy an iPhone every year since the iPhone X (he uses a T-Mobile plan with an upgrade perk btw) and have a diet of mostly frozen food or McDonalds, he actually upgraded his old 2012 PC with a Core i5 3rd generation and a 2011 MacBook Pro to a new $500 Intel Core i5 8th gen build as well as a MacBook Air 2018. He has also managed to secure a driving licence and buy himself a 20 year old Toyota Camry which costed him $1000 so he could potentially enter the food delivery market. Unforunately, despite putting all of his spare income into stocks/crypto, specifically Bitcoin/Ethereum, and Apple/NVIDIA/Tesla/Google/Amazon since 2018 and witnessing the stock boom in 2020, COVID hit, and in March 2020, he lost his job at McDonalds and months later, that McDonalds ended up closing. He therefore, became a Doordash driver (he later invited me in 2023), and despite making some decent money during the weekends, he still didn't have the means to inflate his lifestyle and still remained extremely frugal until well after his graduation. In Summer 2018, he actually did experience his 2nd trip to Europe (mostly France and Benelux) which lasted a week, loved it, and went again in Summer 2019, but this time, he mostly stayed around Central/Eastern Europe. Due to the fact he invested into stocks and crypto, by the end of 2021 when he graduated, due to the stock craze, he had a much healthier lifestyle, albeit still being crippled by CPTSD, and he started taking his ""gap year"" before starting the master's program, to prepare himself again for CS. He ended up auditing at least several MOOCs from edX/Coursera and MIT OCW and even though he was ghosted at several internships during Spring 2022, he was accepted to the first internship in Summer 2022 at a small firm. He then moved onto another internship for Spring 2023, and afterwards, for Summer 2023, he got a remote job as a web developer making 60k a year after demonstrating the project that he and I worked together all the way back in 2012. Again, his lifestyle did not change, but he did visit Vietnam for the first time in 11 years for a week in summer though before the job, mainly to travel and stay at his late grandparents house. Not only did he spend 4 days a week with this remote job, he also collaborated with one of the professors at his alma mater and actually did a research fellowship with him, thereby, gaining research experience.

Now even though his cousin was very hostile towards him, once she graduated in Spring 2020, according to his family (of whom all are still in contact with her), she received a job offer in biochemistry at Seattle, so she moved there for some work experience before starting medical school. As a result of this, my friend totally avoided visiting Seattle or even Washington State in fear of retaliation. Now due to the fact nobody in the family told him that she was moving to Houston TX to attend medical school there in 2023 nor did I or he know anything, he still thought that moving to Houston would be a great idea to save costs whilst getting a much bigger and nicer apartment for the same price, tons of job opportunities and diversity, as well as warmer weather rather than living in working-class Boston suburbs. However, his plan was sabotaged because in June, he was visiting Houston and despite the fact he had no knowledge his cousin lived there, he was at the Houston Galleria, when suddenly, he accidentally bumped into his cousin and her friends. Even though he was just minding his own business and according to his Google Maps Timeline, only travelling around Houston and the suburbs, he saw his cousin and her friends taking a picture of him as ""evidence"" that he was ""harassing"" them. After a few hours at his hotel room, he was then arrested by police and is still being held in jail without bond. I am extremely miffed about this and confused why he was minding his own business and then was arrested after his cousin falsely claimed harassment. He has also been arraigned a day later and from what I heard, he does have a lawyer/attorney to sort out these problems. However, from what I heard, he was being prosecuted for SA, harassment, and that his cousin has threatened legal action against him for 'harassing' her at the mall despite the fact he has not talked to her for 8 years. His parents and whole extended family are standing by the cousin's side despite the fact he has not done anything wrong and what it means is that the 7 years he has been trying to rebuild his life has effectively been wiped from this accusation.

I am really confused on what to do because I wanted to help my friend out as much as I can, but in reality, I don't have the power as I was also just a CS graduate with an also toxic, but much less toxic family than his."
1emo03i,133,2024-08-07,How to do University: A Guide,u/kk55622,usask,https://www.reddit.com/r/usask/comments/1emo03i/how_to_do_university_a_guide/,"I am a graduate student here at USask, and I started my undergrad back in 2017. Perhaps when some of you were still in elementary school. Ever since this subreddit started gaining traction with students, I've been a contributor in trying to answer fellow students questions. And now that I teach on campus and I have experience as a student, I wanted to make a guide for all of the incoming first years, who are about to begin their university journey. I see a lot of common questions on this subreddit, and I also see a lot of mistakes that my own students make. Enjoy! 



**What to bring** 

- Yourself, a backpack, a laptop (doesn't have to be fancy) and something to write with. 

- Pack a lunch on long days (maybe when you have a class and a three hour lab later in the day). You might have a savings account now and you might have a job. The economy is hard right now. Don't buy food on campus unless your rich or it's absolutely necessary. 

- Planner. I cannot stress this enough. Use it. Cherish it. It will be your life line. Personally, physical planners are the only thing that keep me on track. But I'm old school. You could use google calendar or even a digital planner if you have a tablet of some kind. 



  
**How to succeed**

- Go to all of your classes every day. Every. single. one. I made this mistake too. My newfound autonomy entering university direct from high school burned me bad. I almost failed out because I failed to pay attention in class when I went, and would rather sleep through my classes. Now on the teacher side - yes, I can see how much time students spend on canvas. There is a correlation between students who spend more time on class material and those who get higher grades. 

- If you are struggling in the class, get help. If you are not struggling, use the resources available to you anyway. 1st year STEM classes such as physics, chem, and bio, all have structured study sessions. Go to them. You don't have to pay for a tutor (although they are useful). You can even email your profs and ask what resources are available through the university. 

- The library holds in-person workshops. Not only is this a great way to meet people, it's a fantastic way to learn the ins and out of writing, transitioning from high school to university, how to utilize AI in a way that is beneficial (and will not be academically dishonest), etc. 

- *Read the syllabus. READ IT!!!!* Love it, cherish it, memorize it. It is your bread and butter for every class. Profs do not like getting emails from students asking questions about things that are clearly outlined in the syllabus. Write down everything relevant in your planner. 

- Do not get your assignments done on time. Get them done early. I found my most success when I finished an assignment a day or two ahead (and for essays I would often finish them a week ahead). Then I have time to review them before handing them in. And you might even leave a good impression when you don't turn in an assignment at 11:58 on a Tuesday evening, and instead hand it in at 2:00pm, hours before it's due. 

- Do not write things down from your slides word for word. That is pointless. I know because I did it for three years. Your slides are usually available to you before class. Download them. Write down what the prof says next to the slide they are on (keep it brief but try to get all the important points). If you have a tablet, write by hand. If you have a computer, you can type. But there is research that suggests that you retain more information writing by hand. You could also use a notebook, but I haven't seen one of those on campus since 2019 lol. 

- Study. Everyone studies differently. But you need to *actively* learn, as opposed to *passively* learn. Look into the difference between these two. In the first couple weeks of classes, take some time to strategize how you will study based off tips from online. You can refine and personalize this throughout the years. 

- Don't wait until a week before the midterm to study. You should be *actively learning* from the beginning of the semester. Start *actively studying* at least 2 weeks beforehand. It will be hard mentally. But if it's easy, then you're not doing it right. Test yourself and push your limits. 

- I'm begging you to never ever stay up past midnight studying. Go to bed. Get some sleep. It's okay. 

- Fix your sleep schedule before university starts. 

- Work on your phone addiction before university starts (and I should practice what I preach. The things are so addicting). 



**Textbooks**

- Unless you insist on having physical copies, I am begging you, don't drop $500 on new textbooks. You can find them online for free. DM me if you want to know where to find them; but if you google it, you should find some good resources for this. 

- Leading from the last point, you do not need the newest version of the textbook. I think only once in my 5 years of undergrad did I need the newest version because it had a new chapter that we were covering. Otherwise, it's usually small changes between versions that have absolutely no impact. 



**Professionalism** 

- Address your professors by Dr. LastName unless they tell you otherwise. 

- I've noticed a big decline in professionalism in emails. Here's how they should be structured to your professors: 

>\[Subject\] Question for ABC 101  
  
Hello Dr. Last Name,  
  
I hope you are well. I have a question regarding the material in your class, ABC 101. Write your question with great spelling and grammar here.   
  
Thank you for your help,   
Your name

- Trust me, this goes a very very very long way. 

- Unless you're in business, no one expects you to dress up for class. Wear well-fitted clothes that are not too suggestive, especially if meeting with a professor one-on-one. Generally, no one cares. But again.. within reason. 

- Libraries are meant to be quiet spaces. I noticed a remarkable difference pre-covid and post-covid about library etiquette. Respect those who need a quiet space to study and may not have that available to them at home. Don't chew on loud food, keep conversations quiet and to a minimum, and yes, if your music is blasting in your headphones, other people can hear it. 



**ChatGPT** 

- Yeah. So we can tell when you're using it. This is a different beast and profs are uncomfortable about it because it's really hard to navigate. But we can tell when you use it. We can't really penalize you for it, but the only person you are damaging by using it is yourself. Be academically honest. Do your own work. ChatGPT is a tool. NOT something to write your assignments or discussion posts for you. I use it to help me structure essays and give me ideas for topics. Nothing farther than that. I also use it to help with code; BUT I am not a computer science student, so it comes in handy for my research. 



**How to be okay** 

- Mental health is a huge concern among students. If you are struggling, or know someone who is struggling, call 988 or text 686868. 

- We have a Wellness Centre on campus. They have doctors, nurse practitioners, and therapists. Utilize this resource. 

- Self-care. Exercise, drink water, take Vitamin D, take time to enjoy your hobbies (yes, even during midterm and finals season), even if your hobby is rotting on the couch and watching netflix (cause, same). When I started treating school like a 9-5 (okay, maybe more like a 9-8) rather than a 24/7, I felt a weight lift off my shoulders and my grades even improved (despite studying less). 



**USask Specific Stuff and common things from this subreddit**

**-** You didn't get into a class you need to take. Do not panic. At the beginning of the semester, just go to it. And watch the registration page. People will drop a week or two in and room will open up. If room doesn't open up, talk to the professor after class, and let them know your intention to request an override. Then go into the registration page on PAWS, scroll down to the 'class overrides and changing audit/credit status' section and follow the prompts. 

- Bus reliability. Buses in Saskatoon suck. If you have a late night lab or class, make sure your bus actually runs later than 7:00 before the day of your night class/lab. You don't want to be stuck on campus. 

- Places to study that are quiet: Science library (in geology - is the quietest); Health Sciences Library Basement (Health Sciences as a whole should be on this list, but people are notorious for not being quiet when they should be here); Upper floors and North Wing of Murray; STM Library (on 2nd floor).

- Places to study in a group: 1st and 2nd floors of Murray; Health Sciences Atrium (In the D wing, you'll know it when you see it); Health Sciences Atrium #2 (lol, this one is in the E-wing, outside of the library), and you can book study rooms in various places on campus 

- Places to study that are somewhere between quiet and not quiet: Education library, Murray 3rd-5th floors. 

- Classes 10 minutes apart on either side of campus: it's fine. Your prof won't single you out if you leave a couple minutes early or arrive a couple minutes late. Just sit near the back close to an aisle, and don't disturb other students. This is more common than you think. 

- Making friends: clubs, library workshops, learning communities, volunteer somewhere. If you don't make many friends, there's always next year. It can be lonely, I've been there. But it's okay, and a lot more common than you think. 

- Student advisors are good and helpful! They are a great resource. Frankly, I see a lot of bad advice and false information on this sub. If you have a question, first, look it up on the USask website. Or google your question followed by 'USask'. Their website is comprehensive, and mostly up to date and covers a lot more information than you'd think. If you can't find useful information, see a student advisor in your college. You can book appointments through the USask website. Again, just look it up on google. 

  
And that's all I have for now. Please send me questions about this if you have any, I like helping students. I felt like a fish out of water when I started university and I was so lost. I don't ever want students to feel alone. Good luck, and you can do this!

I’d tell you my name, but let’s keep the anonymity on that for the time being. I like to have that kind of barrier when I’ve spoken to deranged medical students and a woman who thought she could be physically turned into a car. I wish I was joking.

I’m from Minnesota. I’m Latino and bi. I’m also a Gemini and my MBTI is ENFJ. I study business, I used to study sociology but then I dropped out of uni. Long story. I work as a server at a hotel for events such as weddings, birthday parties, business retreats. I love it and I hate it, the pay is why I’m still there. 

I love listening to music, my favorite genres are rap, r&b, and alternative rock. I love to journal. I love pretty much anything art in general, traveling, learning new things, basketball and going out. Also play video games, but I haven’t had much time lately. I’m pretty much a pothead so I hope you’d be fine with that lmao. I feel like I can get along with anyone as long as you can put effort into the conversation lol.

1emqnjz,1,2024-08-07,Minors and Second majors help with grad school applications?,u/CSGuy29,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/1emqnjz/minors_and_second_majors_help_with_grad_school/,"Hello, I am a Comp Sci Student who is a rising sophomore, and I’m considering various options as it is around that time I should be finalizing my degree plan. I’m choosing what else to pursue, and I do genuinely have an interest in so many of these fields. My goal is to go to a top grad school for my masters and I’m leaning towards a Machine Learning focus. With that being said, here’ are my ideas:



**Just CS, graduate in 3 years**, at my current school money isn’t really an issue so don’t worry about that, my CS program and my specializiation covers various core topics, some low-level compilers and OS stuff, plus various Machine learning specialized topics.



**CS + Data sci/Math**, this would give me a bit of extra math background (although CS already has quite a bit) which may prove useful and look good for grad applications?, although I’ve also heard some cases of people not really having that background being completely fine since they must take those classes in grad school anyways.



**CS+Finance/Economics/Entrepeneurship**, my goal after working in a company as a Software or Machine Learning Engineer for some time is to start my own startup at some point, but realistically you don’t need a degree for that, still, would these help perhaps with showing I have more of an applicable interest or something for potential admissions reviews?



**CS + Robotics/mechanical Engineering/physics, etc**. this would have me learning a bit more of the hardware/low-level physical side of the field, which could be advantageous if I pursue more physical Machine Learning and software engineering roles related to these, but how would that look for grad school applications in particular having that reach?



**CS+linguistics**, to be honest most of the linguistics stuff is kind of unrelated to what I’d be doing in machine learning even with natural language processing and things like ChatGPT, but having that extra knowledge may prove useful for showing my interest in the field and at least make people thing that I’d be useful for having that reserve knowledge on standby for whatever reason while working on natural language processing. Thoughts on this for grad school applications?



**CS+leadership/project management**, this could be useful since many software engineers (SWEs) typically move into more of manager roles as they get into more senior positions. The thing is though it may have some benefits, most people don’t need this background to do that though but still, how would that affect grad school apps?



**CS+medical engineering branch**, this is similar to the CS+robotics point I made, except with a focus on medical tech. 



**CS+something creative like communications or creative writing** for the creativity and outreach aspect



**CS+full on biology or chemistry** similar to medical engineering but also showing my STEM commitment haha.



**CS+something really opposite it like African american studies, sociology, anthropology, history**. Technically there are applications like with mapping geospatial data and such which I could lean into, but would the quirkiness make it seem better as if I’m more well-rounded per se.



**CS+language like Chinese, Greek, etc**. not much use except that people may like having multilingual applicants to connect better with diverse teams and potential customers (don’t know how much my role would lead to me interacting with them though), grad schools might think I’m more well-rounded.



**CS+a politics/foreign policy branch**



**CS+Enviornmental science** (some use cases to appeal to for grad apps and they might like that broadness)



**CS+Geospatial sciences**, the more direct use-case version of CS+Sociology and related fields, although with CS+Sociology it could seem more like that I have the base knowledge in the two fields ready to combine rather than a shallow overview and combined version I get purely from the Geospatial.



**CS+education, or nutrition**, things I’m interested in but extremely unrelated to what I’d do, just to show off that i’m truly interested in life beyond comp sci and well-rounded per se though?



**CS+metereology**, similar to the above, except some peculiar use cases, perhaps this would be a good way to appeal my uniqueness to the grad admissions?

  






I do know things like projects, resumes, experience, extracurriculars, GPAs, GRE (for CS students does this matter, perhaps at top schools?) matter a lot more, but I still would like to know if these may make a difference

  
**TLDR Would choosing a quirkier minor/second major (that I am genuinely interested in and can tie that interest into Comp Sci for some of these cases) make much of a difference in grad apps?**"

1ems7wo,1,2024-08-07,Hire a Research Writer Vs Using Ai for your Thesis,u/Spirited_Wolf_1939,AcademicResearchHelp,https://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicResearchHelp/comments/1ems7wo/hire_a_research_writer_vs_using_ai_for_your_thesis/,"With the proliferation of AI, most academic research is now driven by Chat GPT, Bard, Bing, Meta, etc. So, ""Is it time to dump your research writer?""

**My thoughts about hiring a Research Writer (aka Research Assistant):**

Hiring the services of a research writer has been a practice for certain categories of students. These include very busy executives, working-class students, nursing mothers, politicians, people with some learning challenges, those who find it difficult to meet the demands of continuous writing, people who cannot deal with and those who have sought extensions repeatedly. 

Depending on the research writer you engage, formidable research-based relationships can be formed and this could translate into; shared experiences, shared knowledge, collaborative interventions, effective project management, a balanced view of the work and other key learnings. In the end, you get to deliver high-quality work, get good grades and leverage such relationships in future studies. 

The challenge you might have occurs when you do not conduct due diligence or you decide to be ‘penny wise’, so you engage someone who does nothing other than copy and paste, use Ai, develop poor write-up and leave you hanging midway through the work. 

**My review on the use of AI for your research:**

The other option is to use the new Sheriff in town, Ai Tools! With these tools, you can issue a command to these tools which are based on Large Language Models (LLMs) or Natural Language Processing (NLP) to write a paragraph, section or chapter of your research work. 

Within minutes or seconds, your content is generated; I can imagine the smile on your face when you take the content, paste it on an AI Humanizer platform and bingo, you feel good to submit. This is good, fast, efficient and super but “there is a but”. 

First, AI sometimes generates silly content which does not have academic backing. Ai-generated references are sometimes wrong and misleading. Some high-level AI detectors can burst the content written by AI and humanised. Also, very importantly, there are some things AI may not effectively do, i.e. Craft a Realistic Research Topic, Determine Academically Compliant Research Objectives, Develop Critical Writeup, Analyse Data, etc. unless you can train it through input and guided instructions. 

However, how can you train AI through input data if you do not understand the demands of academic research? 

**What do you think:**

By working with [Prime Strategic Services Limited](https://primestrategicservices.wordpress.com/), I have consulted for several students in the area of postgraduate research i.e., M.Sc, MBA, DBA & PhD research but I will not tell you what I think.

I’d like you to objectively criticize the reasons I have provided for each option and share your thoughts on which option is best for academic researchers. 

I’m also open to feedback from those who prefer a private conversation, you are welcome to share your thoughts via WhatsApp: +234-706-818-0074

Maybe I should motivate you further, the most objective response will get an ebook gift from me, “Dissertation Hack: the Secrets of Distinction”. 

**Now let’s hear what you think!**

1emxq0t,1,2024-08-08,Does Sapling’s AI Detector Work?,u/gptgabe,stealthgpt,https://www.reddit.com/r/stealthgpt/comments/1emxq0t/does_saplings_ai_detector_work/,"Read the Original Post here: [https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/does-sapling-s-ai-detector-work](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/does-sapling-s-ai-detector-work)

The world of AI writing requires two fields of knowledge: AI-generated text and AI detection tools. Having gushed over StealthGPT as the best AI in the undetectable space, I now have to put our tech to the test against today’s leading AI content detectors.

Today’s review is not for testing against one of those leading AI content detectors like Turnitin, though. It’s for the free version of [Sapling.AI](http://Sapling.AI), which is not just an AI content detector but an AI writing assistant too. So, if Sapling can't detect it, at least it can proofread your work with a grammar checker and autocomplete feature to boot.

# My Grading System

Since Detectors are used by professors and students, I'm going to use an academic model: A,B,C,D,F.

I'm also going to grade for three different categories: Functionality, User Experience, and Pricing. Once I arrive at a letter-grade for each, I'll take the average as the overall grade.

# A First Glance At Sapling AI

Reviewers and academics alike use free detectors when they need a quick fix to rule whether the text in question is legit. Let's see if this Sapling AI Detector fixes anything though.

Mmmmkay....First thing I notice is the rather plain and flat website. It gives me the impression the software is a bit janky but only a test run will tell. At the top, the site goes over the basics of AI writing and AI detection tools. Then scrolling down we see the instructions at the bottom:

What distinguishes Sapling.ai’s free version from the paid version seems to be character limits. The free version allows for only 2,000 characters, but if you sign up for a free trial, you can get the Pro Plan for 30 days. Here’s a screenshot of their pricing if you’re interested:

The pro plan also includes more advanced edits and autocomplete, which is basically proofreading software that autocompletes sentences and acts as a grammar checker. You have to input snippets and mappings for the software to handle the text to your liking which is a very complex process that seems to inhibit free writing for me, rather than enhance it.

The transparency of the site is refreshing though. They aren’t trying to hide that AI detectors come up with false positives and aren’t a perfect method to judge whether any text is AI-generated. Let's see if those warnings are there just to prepare you for their results.

Now that I’m in my account, having set up the free trial of their pro plan, the user interface doesn’t seem too friendly or convenient. I watched their tutorial about using their AI writing assistant, but have no direction where to find their AI detector from my account.

# Testing Against ChatGPT

Does ChatGPT’s language model have what it takes to write an essay that can bypass Sapling.AI?

At first, the AI detector tool didn’t make it clear if I could simply copy and paste my AI-generated text into the dialogue box. I gave it a go anyway, hoping I wouldn’t have to upload a file and it worked. Sadly, it still gave me an error. As you can see here:

So, off to upload our ChatGPT essay, we go:

Ladies and gentlemen, we got detected. 100% too! That’s pretty impressive. It may not be the most convenient interface but [Sapling.AI](http://Sapling.AI) gets points in basic functionality.

# Testing Against StealthGPT

First, let's humanize ChatGPT's text with StealthGPT’s AI Humanizer:

Now, lets try [Sapling.AI](http://Sapling.AI) against our Undetectable AI writing tool:

Damn, only 5.7% fake. [Sapling.AI](http://Sapling.AI) just got WRECKED! Unbelievable. I bet it doesn’t fair well against other undetectable AI writing tools either.

Here's text humanized Undetectable. AI in the first screenshot then in the 2nd screenshot, we see the outcome of that text going up against Sapling.AI:

Wow. 100% fake. I love Sapling.AI! If you're using Undetectableai, you might as well be using ChatGPT. Same result.

If you want to learn more about [How to Bypass AI Detectors](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/bypassing-ai-detectors-stealthgpt), our guide is essential reading.

# Testing Against Human Writing

Lastly, I want to test [Sapling.AI](http://Sapling.AI) against my own human writing. I swear if my text gets a higher fakeness score than StealthGPT’s I'm gonna send a scathing email.

Here’s a reading of my last blog post entitled [Can I Get Free Unlimited Undetectable AI?](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/can-i-get-free-unlimited-undetectable-ai) The answer to which is yes and I can guarantee our free version is has more functionality than Sapling.AI’s. Okay, here goes nothing:

Well, I guess I prefer an error to being called fake.

# Final Grade

Functionality: It was able to detect ChatGPT and Undetectable AI by 100%. On the other hand, I got error messages so frequently that after reading 'unexpected error. Contact support.' on the website numerous times, I just need to warn you, that you can expect errors. It also couldn't detect StealthGPT, so I'm going to give the functionality grade a C.

User Experience: The Website is flat and difficult to navigate. if you sign up for the pro plan you kinda have no idea what to do next from the account page. There isn't a tab or anything to use the detector, I had to go back and google it. F.

Price: Free version that allows a 5,000 character limit and a thirty-day free trial? That's pretty snazzy. I wouldn't use it myself but it's free so who cares if it does anything well? B!

**Overall Grade: C-**

# Conclusion

Does [Sapling.AI](http://Sapling.AI) work? Eh, kinda. The user interface is clunky. The dual AI detection service and AI writing assistant tool makes things more confusing, especially if you just want the detector.

If you actually want an AI writing assistant, and your phone’s autocorrect doesn’t cause enough of a headache for you, then perhaps the grammar checker and autocomplete features here are for you. Having built in Chrome extensions for the AI detector and writing assistant might prove to be useful in some cases though.

Overall, If I had to grade my customer satisfaction with Sapling intelligence, I’d give it a C-. Maybe there’s potential there. It did flag ChatGPT and Undetectable AI, after all. There were so many errors both while copy and pasting as well as uploading Microsoft Word docs, that if I went ahead and contacted customer support, I’d be writing essay-length complaints.

Or maybe I’ll just have StealthGPT write those emails, it’s not like [Sapling.AI](http://Sapling.AI) would know, right?

# FAQ

# What Are AI Detection Tools?

AI Detection tools analyze any piece of text for the watermarks of AI-generated content which may include imagined facts and references and over-simplified word choice and sentences. Some popular AI Detection Tools include Turnitin, GPT4, GPTZero, Copyleaks, [Originality.AI](http://Originality.AI), and more.

# What is Undetectable AI?

Undetectable AI services humanize AI-generated text using a natural language processor that allows it to give any writing a human touch. It makes the word choice and sentence structure more random, like the way human’s naturally write.

# Is Using ChatGPT Plagiarism?

No. ChatGPT, or any AI writing tools create original text. Plagiarism is the theft of someone else’s words or ideas without credit. If you use a text written by ChatGPT to hand in an essay, that’s not traditional plagiarism but what is now known as ""AI plagiarism"". You can read our breakdown on [plagiarism and the ethics of artificial intelligence in academia](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/is-using-chatgpt-plagiarism-academic-dishonesty-in-dishonest-academia) here.

# What Is The Best AI Detector to Use?

Turnitin is certainly the most popular. Their recent update thwarted the bypass efforts of all of StealthGPT’s competition. Our service was prepared though, and is still able to fly undetected by Turnitin. You can read all about [Turnitin’s recent update](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/turnitin-update-stealthgpt-bypasses-turnitin) as well as [StealthGPT’s update](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/stealthgpt-updates-july-2024) on our blog.

# What Is the Best AI to Generate Undetectable Text?

StealthGPT. Hands down. Disagree? Ask [Sapling.AI](http://Sapling.AI) which undetectable text just got flagged as 5% fake after they reviewed our work.

If you need undetectable AI-generated text for essays, articles, social media, content creation and more, look no further than StealthGPT. Our software is available in English but we also have language models for every major language around the world."
1emxuys,5,2024-08-08,Best signs you dated & why?,u/jx408,astrologymemes,https://www.reddit.com/r/astrologymemes/comments/1emxuys/best_signs_you_dated_why/,"Felt inspired by a different but similar post.

Personally so far, it’s been:

1. Aquarius sun ♒️, Scorpio moon ♏️, Virgo rising ♍️, Pisces Venus ♓️, Scorpio mars ♏️: 

Ambitious. Cute flirting style. Loved me thru thick & thin. Most calm & patient man I’ve ever come across- rarely ever let his anger out around me, which made me feel more safe & comfortable. Handled things more maturely for his age. Faithful. Reliable & helpful. Persistent. Cared about me & was still there during one of my darkest years, while I was battling with my mental health when most would’ve just left (regardless of my worse days, he still loved me). So his love felt the deepest for me. Often made me feel desired & attractive throughout it all. Also made me feel safe to express myself in a raw fashion. Good sexual appetite. Adventurous (good balance for me since I was more of a homebody). Peaceful ending.

2) Gemini sun ♊️, Aquarius moon ♒️, Aries rising ♈️, Gemini Venus ♊️, Taurus mars ♉️: 

Naturally had the same top love languages as me & didn’t mind spending quality time with me. Took me to a 5-star restaurant on our 1st date & accommodated my specific food preferences w/ no complaints or weird looks. Helped me with my professional work. Cared about me. Made me feel significant in his life. Introduced something to me that I can have & would support me for the rest of my life. Kind & considerate. Felt love for me. Communicative, open minded, & receptive- I had stimulating & interesting convos with him. Respectful. Flexible. Wanted to be a better man. Humble. More mature. Had Intellect. Provider mindset. Giving & generous. Had the courage to be vulnerable with me. The 1st man to ever give me a bouquet of roses. Artistic.

3) Virgo ♍️: Loving & romantic. Giving & generous (gave me random gifts & notes). Thoughtful. Committed. Wanted to get to know me. Chill to talk to. Attractive & stylish- the popular boy, who told everyone in my grade about me. Surprised me with his friends with a big goodbye card signed from him & all the students & teachers from our grade, along with a decorated letter from his sister before I had to transfer to another school. He turned a disappointing day into a positive one. Good boyfriend but a bad ex."
1emywuw,1,2024-08-08,Classification of different types of heartbeats,u/ErToppa,medical,https://www.reddit.com/r/medical/comments/1emywuw/classification_of_different_types_of_heartbeats/,"Hello everyone,

I am looking for some feedback in the way I am categorizing different types of heartbeats. 

A bit of a background: I am not a medical student and I have no medical training at all. The project I'm working on requires ECG data that must be categorized in specific categories before being used. The aim of the project is to use the labeled data to train a neural network in order to recognize the presence of arrhythmia.

The raw ECG data is labeled as follows:

|Label|Description|
|:-|:-|
|N|Normal beat|
|L|Left bundle branch block beat|
|R|Right bundle branch block beat|
|B|Bundle branch block beat (unspecified)|
|A|Atrial premature beat|
|a|Aberrated atrial premature beat|
|J|Nodal (junctional) premature beat|
|S|Supraventricular premature or ectopic beat (atrial or nodal)|
|V|Premature ventricular contraction|
|r|R-on-T premature ventricular contraction|
|F|Fusion of ventricular and normal beat|
|e|Atrial escape beat|
|j|Nodal (junctional) escape beat|
|n|Supraventricular escape beat (atrial or nodal)|
|E|Ventricular escape beat|
|/|Paced beat|
|f|Fusion of paced and normal beat|
|Q|Unclassifiable beat|
|?|Beat not classified during learning|

The labels must be dividend into the following 5 categories:

|Category|Description|
|:-|:-|
|0|Normal beats|
|1|Supraventricular premature beats|
|2|Premature ventricular contractions|
|3|Fusion of ventricular and normal beats|
|4|Unclassifiable beats|

I've tried doing some research online in order to better understand the meanings of the different labels and (don't hate) I've asked chatgpt how it would divide the labels. The current result is this:

|Category|Labels|
|:-|:-|
|0 - Normal beats|N|
|1 - Supraventricular premature beats|S, A, a, J, j, e|
|2 - Premature ventricular contractions|V, L, R, E|
|3 - Fusion of ventricular and normal beats|F, f|
|4 - Unclassifiable beats|Q, /|

How would you change the association between labels and categories?

Thank you to whoever will take the time to help me :)"

Both parents went there, made lifelong friends, had the best times of their lives, and gained many impactful connections because of this school. Fast forward to my freshman year of high school, I was turned on by the fact that my college guidance counselor doubted my ability to get into $%&. I completed only the bare minimum for every category of strength on my resume. I ensured I got a 90% or above on every course I took to get the best GPA and rank but my method of doing it was sleezy. Because my high school was new and small I was friends with almost all of my teachers who were more than willing to negotiate with me on getting scores better than I deserved. I procrastinated until the LAST second, I wasn't passionate about a single topic and I pretty much forgot about every important topic or piece of knowledge I learned. I only studied to ace an exam and not to actually learn or care. I abused AI so much that I aced two community college courses completely -to boost my class rank- using ChatGPT and none of my own words. I learned nothing except how to thoughtfully cheat. Not to mention the accommodations I absolutely abused even though I don't have an actual learning disability I'm aware of. Even the leadership aspect of my resume is BS: I was captain for three of our sports teams throughout the years including basketball, cross country, and ultimate frisbee. The only reason I was captain was because I'm 6'6"" and our school has no sports influence. Our teams were actual ass in all sports except ultimate. I was one of the student body co-presidents which is an anomaly only accepted by a tiny school and I only got elected through pure popularity. I didn't do a single productive thing during my time as the president. I sat there and watched my co (who is actually a genius) do everything for me. I was even elected as the president of the Habitat for Humanity Club, however, other than attracting more members and doing very little service work myself, I did nothing. Yet, I got into all five prestigious colleges I applied to and the National Honor Society. I'm sitting here now a week before I attend $%& not knowing a damn thing I learned in high school contemplating my life and how unfair it is to other people. About how I ranked no. 2 in my grade and didn't give a single shit. Not to mention, I'm an idiot with the IQ of an average truck driver who is terrible at math and wants to pursue computer science. It's a sad joke. My entire career is proof of how embarrassing the U.S.'s scholastic and education system is and now I don't know what to do."
1en5yu9,35,2024-08-08,Absolute Embarrassment.,u/Deep_Action_1525,GCSE,https://www.reddit.com/r/GCSE/comments/1en5yu9/absolute_embarrassment/,"The last 3 months have been hell on earth. You know what I've learnt from the entire GCSE experience? I'm just not cut out for this whole thing, life in general I guess, my mindset is fragile and weak and honestly disgusting. My attitude repulses me and I hope in writing this and with all the hate comments I'll probably get I can really shove that into my brain. This is long and not worth your time, you don't need to read this, it isn't worth reading, but I'll say it anyways and if you want to tell me to stop being such a dirty, stupid wuss, I agree with you more than you think, and I want you to say it.

After every exam I did during GCSEs, I went home and I hyper-analysed every single question I did that day. I searched endlessly for mark schemes and answers and used chatGPT for every paper I did to find out if I wrote the wrong thing. I naturally found out a lot of the mistakes I made and that mentally killed me. I couldn't go to sleep, disappointed at everything I did wrong, I didn't revise for any exam, I spent every moment after doing an exam thinking about the one before, never looking to the future.

This was stupid, I was miserable, every exam got worse and worse, I mentally got weaker and weaker. Wanna hear the best part? I was calculating my marks from maths paper 1 in maths paper 2, I did this a lot. How stupid can one person be? I've just taken all the stupid out in the world and gobbled it. I made so many mistakes, so many easily avoidable errors, I was once easily a grade 9 student for maths and now I'm probably on 8s. Not bad, but disappointing. Don't get me started on other subjects, I'm only mentioning maths because it's the least embarrassing of the lot. I've fallen off, horribly, more like 9>4/5 in some subjects.

Alarm went off in my exam and I stopped writing for the rest of the exam. I literally could not move my hand, I didn't know what I was writing, I was writing words and none of it made sense. This is just natural selection, I deserve to literally be put down, there's kids in 3rd world countries that would kill to be in my position and I've taken everything, shoved it in ever' faces and I'm still doing it to all of you. Even as I'm writing this, I hate what I've become. The stuff I've mentioned so far was the lightest bits, during Summer? Every day I woke up with a sweat, thinking of all the mistakes I made. Every day I woke up with a new one, a new error, a new thing to research all day every day to see if some allowance would be made for this answer or that answer or my answer or his answer OR WHATEVER. Isn't that disgusting? My parents have seen me deteriorate over time. I was once happy and clever and fun and now I sit in my room all day waiting for my suffering to end. I google answers restlessly, I can't sleep, I wake up jumpy and rush for my phone to google the next mistake I've discovered while I slept. I haven't gone out in the last 3 months, I ignore my friends daily, I'm snappy and irritating with my parents, I'm the worst person on Earth right now. There's nobody out there who could kill your happiness as effectively and as miserably as I can, I project my own misery onto other people and I deserve nothing but pain for it. I have hardly any appetite and eat for my parents' sake. I'm not depressed or anything like that, though I would deserve to be, just disappointed and dumb.

What happened? I've done mocks before, I've done exams before and I've never done this. I wasn't even worried when GCSEs actually started, what the hell is wrong with me? I'm just not built for life, it's genuinely disappointing. I feel so bad for my parents, why did they work so hard to end up with me? Why do I make so many excuses and never sit down and do the work? This whole thing is a big excuse, isn't it gross? I should tag this in meme/humour, but I don't want to kill the vibe there, who would want something this damn disgusting? You can probably see my posts, how I incessantly badger people and ask for constant clarification when it just didn't need to happen. What a gross, disgusting mess. Funniest part? I could click my fingers and make it stop if I really wanted to, if I was a bit stronger, a bit smarter and had thicker skin, I could make everything go poof. My parents would be happier, I wouldn't be such a disgusting rat, people wouldn't be as affected, why can't I just be normal?

This entire summer people have done stuff, learnt a skill, gone out with friends, I've become a grotesque little rat. My falloff needs to be studied, not that it's worth studying and not that it's worth ANYBODYS' time. I'll grow up for A-Levels, I'll pound my head into a brick wall if I need to, I won't do the rubbish I did at GCSEs but wow wasn't this the most disgusting thing you've ever read? And who on Earth would post all this on reddit? You're witnessing stupidity, you're getting dumber reading this.

On Results Day, everybody will be disappointed and confused. How did this happen? I don't know, I've never done it before but if this is how I react after a setback, God knows my mentality cracks quicker than class. I hope I look back on this in a couple years and see how utterly disgusting I was, the worst possible disappointment to good hardworking parents who gave up everything for their selfish, stupid, whining, irritating child.

Like I said, there will be good people who try to tell me that I'm okay and not really that bad and that it's natural to feel like I do and it's fine or whatever but don't waste your energy, I'm not really worth your time so if you have anything nice to say, honestly don't bother because it doesn't apply to me. This isn't me reverse psychologying you or whatever to try and get you to say nice things, genuinely, just don't bother, because they seriously don't apply to me.

tldr: disgusting rat

Thank you.

However, I think a few enhancements could make it even better, especially for students and professionals. Here are some features I believe would be valuable additions:

	1.	Time Tracking Integration:
	•	Integrate time tracking with templates to help users monitor how much time they spend on specific subjects or projects. This would be a great tool for productivity and time management.
	2.	Inbuilt LaTeX Editor:
	•	Instead of having LaTeX functionality only during edits, an inbuilt LaTeX editor would streamline the process of writing and editing mathematical and scientific documents. Adding LaTeX functionality within text boxes would also enhance flexibility and efficiency.
	3.	Comprehensive Geometry Tool Integration:
	•	Include comprehensive geometry tools for creating precise geometric shapes and diagrams directly within GoodNotes. This functionality would be similar to what’s available in dedicated geometry apps, providing all necessary tools for geometric constructions and visualizations.
	4.	Local LLM Integration:
	•	Implement a local language model (LLM) to assist with note-taking and content polishing. This would ensure privacy and provide seamless AI support without relying on external services like ChatGPT.
	5.	Folder Import and Export:
	•	Allow the import and export of entire folders. This would improve file management and make it easier to organize and back up notes.
	6.	Enhanced Keyboard for Math and Chemistry:
	•	Add math and chemistry symbols to the keyboard. This would make it simpler to include these elements in notes, making GoodNotes even more valuable for students and professionals in these fields.

I believe these features would significantly enhance GoodNotes and make it an even more powerful tool for learning and productivity. Looking forward to your thoughts and any updates!"

Any teachers here using AI as an instructional tool with your students? How are you using AI with your students? What works well? What do you wish could be better?

I know people have been using tools like MagicSchool but that is more for creating material. I also know that students have been using tools like Photomath for a while and are using things like ChatGPT all the time but teachers don't use those tools in their own instruction. 

I'm wondering if teachers have found ways of integrating AI in their classroom WITH their students. Would love to hear about your experiences!"

1end9ym,1,2024-08-08,What aspiring economists aren’t being taught,u/Significant-Notice-,marginal,https://www.reddit.com/r/marginal/comments/1end9ym/what_aspiring_economists_arent_being_taught/,"From [Steve Landsburg in the WSJ](https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-aspiring-economists-arent-being-taught-a3f73484):

Here’s an economics brain teaser: Apples are provided by a competitive industry. Pears are provided by a monopolist. Coincidentally, they sell at the same price. You’re hungry and would be equally happy with an apple or a pear. If you care about conserving societal resources, which should you buy?

Most of my sophomore-level economics students can solve this problem, which I posed on an exam. Almost nobody else can. I’ve tried it out on a lot of smart lawyers, accountants, entrepreneurs and scientists. Neither can the latest version of ChatGPT.

First I’ll tell you the answer; then I’ll tell you the moral. In a competitive industry, prices are a pretty good indicator of resource costs. Under a monopoly, prices usually reflect a substantial markup. So a $1 apple sold by a competitor probably requires almost a dollar’s worth of resources to produce. A $1 pear sold by a monopolist is more likely to require, say, 80 cents worth of resources. To minimize resource consumption, you should buy the pear.

Agree or not?  The entire piece is of interest.  [Ben Golulb is upset](https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://x.com/ben_golub/status/1821214443629326564), but for an economist at Northwestern he doesn’t have much of an argument, as Robin Hanson [points out](https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://x.com/robinhanson/status/1821267222217556065).  Which is in fact the best argument against Landsburg’s claim?

Others are doing ChatGPT, which I find to be unsustainable to do in the long run. I genuinely want to learn coding, but I find that this is a big roadblock that i need to tackle yesterday.

AI audio models are now capable of describing and producing specific sounds, a significant development for creators working on multimedia projects. These models can generate sounds like police sirens paired with a burning building, enhancing the realism of the project. The interaction between large language models (LLMs) and voice interfaces is becoming more natural, resembling conversations with a person. This advancement is anticipated to lead to the development of a general AI audio model, offering further possibilities in audio production [1][3].







The a16z Podcast, produced by Andreessen Horowitz, provides insights into tech and culture trends, news, and the future. The podcast features industry experts, business leaders, and other voices from around the world, with multiple episodes released weekly [2][4].







Ian Webster, founder of PromptFoo, advocates for open source and transparency in addressing AI risk. He believes that allowing everyone who wants to help secure applications is the best way forward. This perspective was shared in a discussion between a16z General Partner Anjney Midha and Ian Webster on the importance of red-teaming for AI safety and security [5][6][7].







NVIDIA has developed the GenAI-Perf tool to measure and optimize generative AI model performance, specifically for LLMs. This tool provides metrics such as time to first token, output token throughput, and inter-token latency to help achieve optimal performance. It supports OpenAI-compatible APIs for evaluating model performance and facilitates standardized performance evaluation across different inference engines [8].







Groq Inc is hosting their first Denver-based hackathon, offering participants the chance to meet local Groqsters, get increased rates on Groq, and win prizes. In addition, Groq Inc has announced that they are now SOC 2 Type II compliant, demonstrating their commitment to upholding high standards of security and compliance [10][11].







The Interpretability team at Anthropic has shared their insights on the next five hurdles towards achieving a mechanistic understanding of neural networks in their latest research update. The team encourages treating the results as preliminary thoughts shared in a lab meeting rather than a mature paper [14].







NVIDIA is actively involved in the research and development of 6G technology, leveraging AI-native tools and collaborating with industry partners and organizations like the AI-RAN Alliance, 3GPP, and O-RAN. They are contributing to the development of AI/ML methodologies for the radio access network (RAN) and are working on AI-driven air interfaces, digital twin networks, and over-the-air (OTA) development platforms for 6G [15].







Yann LeCun acknowledges that many AI/ML/CV/NLP PhDs today, including his own students and those of Geoff and Yoshua, had a head start in deep learning in the 2000s when few others were working in the field. He identifies three great scientific questions: What's the universe made of? What's life all about? What is intelligence? He believes that answering the question about intelligence can only be achieved by creating intelligent machines [20][21][22][23].

1enueno,18,2024-08-09,What actually happened in Bangladesh and lessons for India,u/Much_Independent_574,indiadiscussion,https://www.reddit.com/r/indiadiscussion/comments/1enueno/what_actually_happened_in_bangladesh_and_lessons/,"**Student Protests Over Quota System in Bangladesh**

In Bangladesh, student protests erupted over the perceived unfairness of the quota system in government jobs and educational institutions. The system originally reserved 30% of these opportunities for freedom fighters but was later extended to include the children and grandchildren of freedom fighters, a group that constitutes only about 0.13% of the population. This discrepancy sparked widespread outrage among students, who argued that the quota system was inequitable.

The intensity of the protests led the government to abolish the quota system in 2018. However, in a controversial turn of events, the High Court of Bangladesh ruled in 2024 that the government's decision to remove the quota system was unconstitutional, thus reinstating it.

**The Political Underpinnings of Sheikh Hasina's Stance**

Sheikh Hasina, the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, implicitly supported the reservation system. This support was partly driven by political considerations, as the beneficiaries of the quota system were likely to be loyal to her and her family. Sheikh Hasina hails from the family of Mujibur Rahman, the founding leader of Bangladesh and a prominent freedom fighter. By ensuring that a significant portion of government positions were held by descendants of freedom fighters, she could secure a government filled with allies.

On the surface, this might appear as an unfair manipulation of the system. However, the context reveals a more complex rationale. Sheikh Hasina’s entire family was tragically murdered by the extremist group Jamaat-e-Islami, which wields significant influence in Islamic countries, including Bangladesh. There was a legitimate concern that if members of Jamaat-e-Islami occupied even 20% of government seats, they could potentially orchestrate a coup to overthrow her moderate liberal administration and also murder her.

Critics, particularly from left-leaning platforms, will highlight Sheikh Hasina's apparent unfairness in maintaining the quota system but don't discuss the reasons for her support to the reservation system. Her approach was, in part, a defensive measure to prevent extremist elements from gaining power and endangering her government and personal safety, which is exactly what happened.

**The Military Coup and International Dynamics**

Towards the end of this political saga, the military took advantage of the chaotic situation. The military commander, allegedly paid off by the CIA, refused to take orders from Sheikh Hasina, forcing her to flee the country. This move aligns closely with the CIA's historical playbook, which has often involved destabilizing governments deemed unfavorable to U.S. interests.

What intensified the intrigue was the subsequent refusal of the UK and the US to grant political asylum to Sheikh Hasina. These countries, known for offering asylum to various criminal figures—including the Shah of Iran after the Iranian Revolution despite his brutal crackdown on Iranians—denied her refuge. This refusal highlighted a stark contradiction in the asylum policies of these nations, sparking further debate on international political motives and alliances. Anyone who thinks this was a pro-democracy student led protest has their head up their a\*\*.

**Lessons for India**

The events in Bangladesh offer several critical lessons for India, particularly concerning its relationship with the United States:

1. **Reevaluating Ties with the US**: I have been saying this for a long time and will say it again, The US is the worst s\*um on eath country to exist. We need to normalize ties with china ASAP. Go through my comment history and you'll see I have pushed for this.
2. **US Pressure Tactics**: The primary reason for the US to support a more extremist government in Bangladesh is to exert pressure on India. As one of the few sovereign states refusing to toe the US line, India faces a threat. By surrounding India with hostile regimes, the US aims to coerce India into compliance. If India continues to resist, the US will fund terror organizations in India's Northeast, much like how Israel faces threats in its region.
3. **Economic Control**: The US seeks to dominate Indian markets, allowing American companies to run amok and creating a capitalist sh\*t hole like in the US. Additionally, the US wants to ensure India distances itself from Russia and aligns more closely with Western economic and political interests.
4. **Geopolitical Manipulation**: Another significant reason behind US policy is the desire to see India engage in conflict with China. The US, anticipating an inevitable confrontation with China, prefers India to serve as the frontline, thereby weakening China before a direct US engagement. This manipulation positions India as cannon fodder in the broader geopolitical struggle.
5. **Control of Information**: They want to control the indian mind. You might think Ig, FB, Twitter etc are beacons of American free speech but all they are are tools for the US govt to control the narrative in India and control the mind of Indians. Recent example being stand with reasi was pulled down by Ig but stand with Rafah was promoted. They want a certain ideology to prevail. I FULLY suport the banning of such platforms in india. We need a China like ecosystem with indigenously developed social media sites controlled within india and closed off from the rest of the world.

1envfb8,1,2024-08-09,"Close to dropping out, alternative routes?",u/lucky-sway,AskProgramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/1envfb8/close_to_dropping_out_alternative_routes/,"Firstly, sorry for all the complaining and broken grammar.

I'm going into my third year of computer science. I feel like school is wasting my time. Although the things we learn seem useful, I find myself just trying to find shortcuts through ChatGPT for assignments and cramming for exams, memorizing ppt slides of relevant SW content but worth like 50 % of my grade. I don't do well in those. The way they test is so specific that little mistakes add up to a failing grade and I think that's quite literally the worst representation of my learning and applying it. So far, most of my courses have been like that. Assignments of mini-projects, quizzes, midterms...

Heck, we still need to learn Assembly and C and other bs that I don't feel like I need to spend $1000 on each course to forget like 2 weeks after the semester ends.

For context, my remaining courses include, database, networking, compiler design, server-side development, etc. Yes, I agree they are useful courses but the way they teach it is dump every info taken from a textbook or some Stanford/Berkeley CS course. Then again the cycle continues with exams (taking up like 70% of grade) with very specific info from lectures that I will forget. There is so useful aspects like application or project building! This stuff isn't even what I want to do in the field.

I suck at just memorizing and getting tested on it. I don't think the exams are useful at all.

The other thing is that I know what I want to do in the field, that is, either full-stack dev or machine learning (AI path). Both of those positions seem attainable without a degree. Should I really consider dropping out if I feel this way and I feel like I would benefit much better by learning useful topics online and going straight into application (projects)?

I'm so close to calling it quits in university but my only concern is jobs that require a bachelor's degree (still like 85%) of the industry.

Will I be set back from my classmates? Would it be easier or harder to get a job?

If I do drop out, I know I'll put 100% in my own learning and make sure I get stuff done.

Maybe I'm just a complainer and need to get my shit together. Thanks for reading this.

TLDR: 3rd year uni student, thinking cs degree in uni is useless content. want to dropout and self teach what I want to go into (frontend, backend, fullstack, machine learning). is it worth it?"

""There is consensus that Hazrat Aisha was 10 years younger than her elder sister Asma, whose age at the time of the hijrah, or migration to Madina, was about 28. It can be concluded that Hazrat Aisha was about 18 years old at migration. On her moving to the Prophet’s house, she was a young woman at 21. Hisham is the single narrator of the hadith whose authenticity is challenged, for it does not correlate with the many historical facts of the time. ""

""The fact is that the marriage of the Holy Prophet of Islam with Hazrat Aisha was a perfectly suitable marriage with the consensus of both parties including the parents of Hazrat Aisha as she had reached an age of maturity. Most of the traditions and references that are quoted about her age being less than 10 years or even lower are completely contradictory and unreliable as already explained. ""

Shaykh Dr Ridhwan Saleem | Proof that Lady Aisha was over 15 years old when she married the Prophet (s) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwH6roHtIQg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwH6roHtIQg) & here another link in text of the video [https://hameem.org/2019/02/11/proof-that-aisha-was-over-15-years-old-when-she-married-the-prophet-peace-be-upon-him/](https://hameem.org/2019/02/11/proof-that-aisha-was-over-15-years-old-when-she-married-the-prophet-peace-be-upon-him/)

""In conclusion, although the ‘six-nine’ hadith may be authentic, it is based ultimately on the authority of Aisha. In view of prevailing norms of her time, it is very unlikely that she knew her own age, and other reports and historical evidence indicate that she was, in fact, between fifteen and nineteen years of age when the marriage was consummated. As these other reports relate Aisha’s age to actual historical events that took place, they are likely to be a far more reliable indicator. History shows that the conceptualisation of numbers in medieval times was often primitive.... Finally, it should be remembered that the ‘six-nine’ narration is an ahad\[37\] hadith and therefore not considered to provide absolute certainty according to the Sunni epistemological system. And God knows best.""

[The Highest Authority in Sunni Islam Just Declared an End to Child Marriage in Africa](https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/end-child-marriage-sunni-islam-africa4girls/) scholars: grand Imam of Al Azhar, Sheikh Dr. Salah Abbas, issued a fatwa against child marriage.

""According to the fatwa, both girls and boys must be 18 years old to get married; any marriage at a younger age is forbidden...

""Marriage in Islam is based on the consent of both parties, especially the girl...the minimum age required for consent is 18 years old,” the deputy grand Imam said. ""

""Although Abbas’ speech was short, it was very precise about the cost of child marriages — that they steal girls’ childhoods.

“Consent requires that the girl is sufficiently mature and able to express her will to marry,” Abbas said. “That in turn guarantees her full enjoyment of her fundamental rights to childhood, education, and the ability to meet the responsibilities of marriage.” ""

""These two facts lead to the fact of the age of Aisha. She was born seventeen years before the Bi'thah. The Prophet remained in Makkah for 13 years the migrated to Madinah. This means that Aisha was thirty years old when the prophet migrated to Madina. The marriage took place two years after migration which means that Aisha was thirty two years old when the marriage was consummated. ""

"" The earliest surviving biography of Muhammad, Abu Muhammad 'Abd al-Malik bin Hisham's recension of Ibn Ishaq's *Sirat Rasul Allah -- The Life of the Messenger of God* records that Aisha accepted Islam shortly after it was revealed -- 12 years before her marriage -- and there is no way she could have done so as an infant or toddler.....Finally, Imam Wali-ud-Din Muhammad ibn Abdullah Al-Khatib, dead for more than 700 years, recorded in the biographical section of *Miskat al-Masabih* that Asma, her elder sister of 10 years, died at the age of 100, 72 years after Aisha's wedding.

*T.O. Shanavas* | Was Ayesha A Six-Year-Old Bride? [http://www.ilaam.net/Articles/Ayesha.html](http://www.ilaam.net/Articles/Ayesha.html)

""It was neither an Arab tradition to give away girls in marriage at an age as young as seven or nine years, nor did the Prophet marry Ayesha at such a young age. The people of Arabia did not object to this marriage because it never happened in the manner it has been narrated.

Obviously, the narrative of the marriage of nine-year-old Ayesha by Hisham ibn \`Urwah cannot be held true when it is contradicted by many other reported narratives. Moreover, there is absolutely no reason to accept the narrative of Hisham ibn \`Urwah as true when other scholars, including Malik ibn Anas, view his narrative while in Iraq, as unreliable. The quotations from Tabari, Bukhari and Muslim show they contradict each other regarding Ayesha’s age. Furthermore, many of these scholars contradict themselves in their own records. Thus, the narrative of Ayesha’s age at the time of the marriage is not reliable due to the clear contradictions seen in the works of classical scholars of Islam.

Therefore, there is absolutely no reason to believe that the information on Ayesha’s age is accepted as true when there are adequate grounds to reject it as myth. Moreover, the Quran rejects the marriage of immature girls and boys as well as entrusting them with responsibilities. ""

""The popular version of aisha’s youth age has been exploited by the anti-Islamic groups to attack the Prophet “for marrying a child”. The fact of the matter is that Lady aisha was not a child when she was married in 2 AH to the Prophet. At-Tabari, the famous Muslim historian, writes that Abu Bakr’s first two wives and their children were all born in the pre-Islamic era. (Ta’rīkh at-Tabari, vol. 2 \[beirut: al-A‘lami, n.d.\] p. 616.) Based on this, even if she was born a year before the commencement of Islam, aisha would be 15 or 16 years old at the time of her marriage to the Prophet – an age in which marriage is common in most cultures. Ibn Kathīr, in his al-Bidãyah wa ’n-Nihãyah (vol. 8, p. 381) states that Asma bint Abu Bakr, the sister of aisha, was ten years older than aisha. He also reports that Asma died in the year 73 AH at the age of 100. Based on this calculation, ‘aisha was 18 or 19 years old at the time of her marriage. ""

""First we shouldn't take the words of the mujtahids on the age of Ayesha as gospel as they are primarily scholars of law and not history. According to scholars who specialize in history like Allamah Sayyid Ja'far Murtada al-Amili in his ""Sirah al-Nabi al-\`Adham"" Ayesha was about 20-22 when she got married to the Prophet and Khadija was 27. Ayesha being 9 was a proto-Sunni invention to bring her status up, and similarly 40 for Khadija (ra) was to bring hers down.

This being said, Ayatollah Sayyid Husseini Qazvini, an actual historian, has also proven this to be false as well. Please refer to the following link: [http://www.valiasr-aj.com/fa/page.php?bank=question&id=699](http://www.valiasr-aj.com/fa/page.php?bank=question&id=699) 

That's not based on the age of Ayesha, but it is a selection from a pool of contradicting hadiths which state at what age a girl is considered baligh. The pool of hadiths range up til 15 in shii hadith literature. ""

""the shia tradition which states the age of 9 is a isolated report (khabar al-wahid) and cannot be relied upon. Again let me repeat this, this ruling of 9 years (actually completion of 9, which is 10 in actuality) is not based on the so-called age of Ayesha."" by [\~Hannibal\~](https://www.shiachat.com/forum/profile/4-hannibal/)

Abu Hanifa even ruled that a girl is baligh at 18

According to Shaykh al-Tusi (ra) the age of bulugh for girls is 15 and according to Fayd al-Kashani (ra) it is 13.

Muhammad b. al-Hasan with his isnad from Muhammad b. \`Ali b. Mahbub from Muhammad b. al-Husayn from Ahmad b. al-Hasan b. \`Ali from \`Amr b. Sa\`id from Masdaq b. Sadaqa from \`Ammar as-Sabati from Abu \`Abdillah (as). He said: I asked him about the boy, when is it salat obligatory for him? So he said: When he comes to thirteen years. As to when he has a nocturnal emission prior to that, then salat becomes obligatory for him, and the pen flows upon him. And the girl is like that when she comes to thirteen years, or she menstruates prior to that, then salat has become obligatory for her, and the pen flows upon her. - age 13

1eo9c07,1,2024-08-09,How a Beginner should start coding 2024,u/chadicus-gigo,gigodev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gigodev/comments/1eo9c07/how_a_beginner_should_start_coding_2024/,"Technology is changing the way we live. At the time of publishing over 92% of all jobs require digital skills. This digital transformation has led to an appropriate increased demand for software developers.

In this article, we’ll discuss how you can achieve higher paying jobs and better benefits by learning to code from scratch.

**What is programming?**

Programming is the process of writing instructions for computers or machines. We call these instructions code. Code enables computers to perform specific tasks, solve problems, or create desired outputs.

You may have heard terms like Python and JavaScript before. These are different languages of code. Like human languages, such as English and Portuguese, there are unique rules and guidelines that all Programming languages follow.

These rules, known as syntax, are used to write the code, allowing programmers to uniformly communicate with the computer effectively across a broad spectrum of applications.

**Why Learn Programming?**

Software developers are in-demand and highly compensated. Computer programming is a hard skill, once you’ve obtained the information you’ll have access to a wide range of good paying roles offered by employers who need somebody with your knowledge base.

Beyond professional opportunity, knowing how to program is essentially a super power. Think of it as having the ability to bring your ideas to life. The only thing limiting your creations are your imagination and willingness to commit time.

The greatest benefit, though perhaps more subtle, is a new critical thinking blueprint. When you learn to program, you learn to design solutions to your specific problems. Crafting genuinely creative internal assessment systems for more impactful, efficient problem solving.

**5 Steps to landing your first programming job in 2024**

1. Pick a Project  
2. Build Programming Fundamentals  
3. Learn Programming Basics  
4. Work on Projects  
5. Apply for a Job

# 1. Pick a Project

The best way to [learn to code](https://medium.com/@gigo_dev/whats-the-best-way-to-learn-to-code-c01dcd62bf6e) is to learn by doing. This comes down to identifying something that you want to build and working towards it on a daily basis, incrementally stepping to the final version gaining proficiency at each step along the way.

Pick something you care about that will keep you motivated. This is a far superior method to just stepping thru the language specific “books”, also known as language documentation. Instead of reciting an encyclopedia of syntax definitions, you understand concepts in the context that they are applicable to helping accomplish a task.

When it comes time to search for a job, you may have no previous programming employment history, but you can point towards a repository of projects you’ve either completed or contributed to.

# 2. Build Programming Fundamentals

Most programmers worth their salt know multiple languages. There are common principles that every language uses and while sometimes they are called different names, the fundamentals remain the same. Learning the fundamentals will help you immensely as you move onto your project.

As an example, here are some programming fundamentals beginners need to know to start coding:

**Syntax** — The rules that define the structure of the language. The syntax tells you exactly which words and symbols you need to use when you write your code based on its language. Because computers don’t think, you have to be very specific when writing code. At some point, every programmer has sat at the keyboard trying to figure out why their code wasn’t working only to realize they were missing something simple, like a semicolon. (i.e a simple syntax error)

**Tools** — There are a variety of tools that make programming easier. For example, one of the core programming tools is an integrated development environment (IDE), that checks your syntax for errors, organizes your files, and autocompletes lines of code for you. Another fantastic example of a modern tool that programmers use is generative AI such as ChatGPT, Mistral or MetaAI.

Learning to take advantage of these tools and using them to their full potential will reduce the impact of the inevitable bumps in your coding journey.

# 3. Learn Programming Basics

If you have a specific reason for learning to code, you may already know which language you want to start with. For instance, if you want to be a game developer, C++ & JavaScript are probably your best choice. If you want to learn to program but haven’t determined your first language, there are several beginner-friendly languages that serve as a good starting point. Python is one of the easiest languages for beginners to pick up.

# 4. Work on Projects

From here it all becomes a numbers game, how many projects can you get under your belt.

# How To Choose Programming Projects

**Start Simple**

It’s best to start with simple projects. If you want to get into game design, you may be tempted to start trying to create the next massive online role-playing game. However, you’ll be better off creating something simple, such as a basic top down shooter with one level.

A static portfolio website is a simple option that can grow with you. You can show off what you know and add more complicated projects as you master more skills.

**Create Something Useful**

Think about the “sticking points” of your day. Do you run into the same problems or regularly have to do the same repetitive activities? Create something that will solve the problem or automate the work for you. Your community is great for ideas, too. Do the people in your clubs or organizations complain about the same issues often? See if you can brainstorm a solution. Real-world problem solving is a great addition to your portfolio.

1eodc3p,12,2024-08-09,Imam Abu Haneefah [Part 3] | Hanafis and Matureedis,u/JabalAnNur,Hanafiyyah,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hanafiyyah/comments/1eodc3p/imam_abu_haneefah_part_3_hanafis_and_matureedis/,"بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم الحمد لله رب العالمين والصلاة والسلام على سيد المرسلين وعلى آله وأصحابه ومن اتبعهم بإحسان إلى يوم الدين

In the name of Allaah, the Most Beneficient, the Most Merciful. All praise is due to Allaah, Lord of the worlds. Peace and blessings upon the master of the messengers, upon his family, his companions, and whoever follows them with goodness till the day of judgement.

This is our last part regarding the series of posts expanding upon the imam upon whom the madhab is based. This post could have been included in the last post however due to vast amount of things to say regarding this topic, it warrants a separate post. So let us begin.

# **Who are the Matureediyyah?**

## **Its Founder**

Its founder and the one to whom this sect is ascribed to is Abu Mansoor Muhammad ibn Muhammad ibn Mahmood al-Matureedi as-Samarqandi.

He was a follower of the Hanafi school and was known for his intelligence and reasoning. He studied various sciences and authored many works on creed and refutations against the Mu'tazilah. He was also well-versed in Greek philosophy, as evidenced by his references to its sects and his mention of philosophical views.

Abu al-Hasanat al-Lucknowi in [[الفوائد البهية في تراجم الحنفية](https://shamela.ws/book/132617/195)] said,

> He wrote great works, and refuted the false and wrong views of the misguided sects. He wrote the book 'At-Tawheed', al-Maqalat, Aohaam al-Mu'tazilah, Rad al-Usool al-Khamsa against Abu Muhammad al-Baahili, Rad al-Imamah against some of the Rawafidh, Rad 'Ala al-Qaramitah, and Ma'khaz ash-Shara'i Fi al-Fiqh wa'l Jadl in principles of jurisprudence, and other than that. He died in 333 AH.

It should be noted that the books of history and biographies do not contain great detail on the life of Abu Mansoor, unlike Al-Ash'ari. Which is why there is no praise for him, no criticism, nothing from his contemporaries.

It is astounding that someone whose condition and life is not known, someone who has not been mentioned by any reliable authority during his time, can be considered as the ""translator of Abu Haneefah's creed"" as some of the Matureedis have claimed.

Abu Mansoor died in 333 AH, near the age of 95. His grave is in his home city of Samarqand.

### **His Teachers**

His teachers as has come in [[أبو منصور الماتريدي حياته وآراؤه العقدية](https://archive.org/details/002-pdf_20210110/mode/2up)], pg. 45-47.

(1) Muhammad ibn Muqaatil al-Raazi

(2) Abu Nasr Ahmad ibn al-'Abbas as-Samarqandi

(3) Abu Bakr Ahmad ibn Ishaaq al-Jurjaani

(4) Nasr (Nusayr) ibn Yahya al-Balkhi

### **His Students**

His students as came in ibid. pg. 49

(1) Abu al-Qaasim Ishaaq ibn Muhammad, known as Al-Hakeem as-Samarqandi

(2) Abu al-Hasan 'Ali ibn Sa'eed ar-Rustughfani

(3) Abu Muhammad Abd al-Kareem ibn Moosa al-Bazdawi

(4) Abu Ahmad Nasr ibn Ahmad ibn al-'Abbas

(5) Abu Abdur Rahmaan ibn Abi Layth al-Bukhaari

## **Background of the Sect**

The sect emerged in the 4th century AH in the lands beyond the river (Transoxiana).
Initially, it was relatively obscure and not known among most scholars of the 4th, 5th, and 6th centuries. It was not mentioned in their books which mentioned the different sects. The Matureedi sect was not acknowledged by the early Ash'aris either, such as Al-Baqillani, Ibn Furuk, Abu al-Ma'li al-Juwayni, Abu Haamid al-Ghazaali and so on.

The first Ash'ari to mention Abu Mansoor al-Matureedi, and the Matureediyyah was Al-Fakhr al-Raazi (d. 606 AH) in Arba'een Fi Usool ad-Deen (1/277). The first from Ahlus Sunnah to mention the Matureedis or point to them was Imam Abu Nasr 'Ubaydullaah ibn Sa'eed as-Sijzi (d. 444 AH) in ""Risalah as-Sijzi Ila Ahl az-Zabeed"".

## **Different Stages of Matureediyyah.**

### **Development**

This is the stage during which the students of al-Maturidi and those who were influenced by him developed his ideas further, and formed an independent kalami (philosophical) group. The group first appeared in Samarkand, and worked to spread and defend the thought of their shaykh and leader, and wrote books.

### **Consolidation**

The main feature of this stage was prolific writing of books and compiling of evidence on which the Maturidi beliefs were based. Therefore it was the most important stage in terms of consolidating this school of thought. 

### **Expansion and Spread**

This is regarded as one of the most important stages, in which the Maturidis reached the peak of their expansion and spread. That was due to the support of the Ottoman sultans. Maturidi dominance spread wherever Ottoman dominance reached. So they spread eastwards and westwards in the Arab lands, India, and the lands of the Turks, Persians and Byzantines, they still have a presence in these lands. 

## **Its Scholars**

The scholars and men who spread and taught this sect are many, and some of them wrote many books on the Matureediyyah, which caused it to spread among the Hanafis and others.

(1) Abu Layth as-Samarqandi (d. 373 or 375 AH)

(2) Abu al-Yusr al-Bazdawi (d. 493 AH)

(3) Abu Ishaaq Ibraheem ibn Isma'eel as-Saffaar (d. 534 AH)

(4) Abu al-Ma'een an-Nasafi (d. 508 AH)

(5) Abu Hafs Umar an-Nasafi (d. 537 AH).

(6) Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-Ghaznawi (d. 593 AH)

(7) Burhaan ad-Deen an-Nasafi (d. 687 AH)

(8) Abu al-Barakat an-Nasafi (d. 710 AH)

(9) Ibn al-Hummam (d. 861 AH)

(10) Mullaah Ali al-Qaari (d. 1014 AH)

(11) Mahmood Hasan ad-Deobandi (d. 1339 AH)

(12) Muhammad Zaahid al-Kawthari (d. 1339 AH)

# Are Hanafis and Matureedis the same?

Before we continue, some of the foolish claim that being a Hanafi means being a Matureedi, and that a Hanafi can have no other creed except that.

In truth, this is from the ignorance of the religion and definitions as being a Hanafi is related to Furoo', while the Matureedis are related to 'Aqeedah.

Abu al-Hasanat al-Lucknowi in [[الرفع والتكميل ص ٣٨٦](https://shamela.ws/book/5973/233)] stated,

> To clarify, the term Hanafiyyah refers to a group that adheres to the teachings of Imam Abu Haneefah in matters of Furoo' (i.e. Fiqh) and follows his methodology in legal practices, whether or not they agree with him in matters of creed. If they align with him in both jurisprudence and creed, they are referred to as ""complete Hanafis"". If they only follow him in jurisprudence but differ in creed, they are referred to as Hanafis with a term that indicates their stance in creedal matters.

As evidence for this, we will name some Hanafis who are part of the different groups which Al-Lucknowi has mentioned.

First: the complete Hanafiyyah. They are people - as per al-Lucknowi- who match Abu Haneefah's creed and Fiqh. From them are names such as Zuffaar ibn Hudayl, Abu Yoosuf, Muhammad ibn al-Hasan, Abu Sulaymaan al-Juzjaani, Ma'lla ibn Mansoor, Hisham ibn 'Ubaydullah al-Raazi, At-Tahaawi, and other Hanafis who were close to the times of Abu Haneefah, and were from his immediate students. Some of the later ones also come in this category.

Second: the Mu'tazilah from Hanafiyyah. Some names are Muhammad ibn ash-Shujaa', Abu Hashim al-Jubba'i, Abu Ali al-Jubba'i, az-Zamakshari and others.

Third: the Shi'ah from Hanafiyyah. Al-Lucknowi mentioned them as in ibid.. A name from them is Al-Hasan ibn Abdullaah, known as Ar-Ra'eesi. He was a Shi'i Baatini, but Hanafi in Fiqh.

Fourth: the Murji'ah from Hanafiyyah. Ibn Karam as-Sijistaani, shaykh of the Karamiyyah was Hanafi in Fiqh.

Fifth: the Jahmiyyah from the Hanafiyyah. People such as Bishr al-Marisi, Ahmad ibn Abi Du'ad come in this category. Imam Ahmad also mentioned in his book that some companions of Abu Haneefah took the sayings of Jahm.

One who can read Arabic can search the names we have mentioned here in books noting Hanafi scholars, such as [[الجواهر المضية في طبقات الحنفية](https://shamela.ws/book/6725)], [[الفوائد البهية في تراجم الحنفية](https://shamela.ws/book/132617)] and [[تاج التراجم في طبقات الحنفية](https://shamela.ws/book/10925)].

Therefore, the claim that the Matureedis and Hanafis are one and the same is made out of severe ignorance.

# **Is Abu Haneefah a Matureedi?**

For those who do not wish to embroil themselves in this discussion, the short answer is no. Abu Haneefah (may Allaah have mercy on him) passed away in 80 AH, while Abu Mansoor al-Matureedi, the man whom this sect originates from, would not be born until 238 AH. Therefore, such a long gap does not convince the sound and sane mind that Abu Haneefah would be a follower of somone whose father was yet to be born.

The argument made to justify the claim is that while Abu Mansoor al-Matureedi came later, he is the one who elaborated and expanded upon the beliefs and creed of Abu Haneefah, may Allaah have mercy on him. Therefore, it is only fair that we compare the beliefs of Abu Haneefah with the Matureediyyah, and see if they are the same or not.

## **1.) Their views on 'Ilm al-Kalaam**

Those who argue that Abu Haneefah was a Matureedi or held their beliefs point to the period in Abu Haneefah's life where he indulged in, and was knoweldgeable about 'Ilm al-Kalaam. They argue that Abu Mansoor did not make up a new sect, rather he expanded upon Abu Haneefah's Kalaam.

In [[شرح المقاصد للتفتازاني](https://archive.org/details/SHMAQT01_201611/SHMAQT01/page/n161/mode/2up?view=theater)],

> Al-Kalaam. it is knowledge in the religious beliefs with definitive evidences.

One should keep in mind that the author is a Matureedi, and near the Matureediyyah, reason ('aql) is definitive while revelation is not, which is why if the revelation ""contradicts"" reason, they prefer reason over revelation, as mentioned in books such as Sharh al-Maqasid, Sharh al-Aqaaid an-Nasafiyyah, Isharaat al-Maram, and others.

As for Abu Haneefah, then we have mentioned in [Part 1] that Abu Haneefah eventually left al-Kalaam. However, what we intentionally did not expand upon it. In the story of how he repented from Kalaam and started to focus on Fiqh, he said,

> “I have no further use for Kalaam.""

This statement on the surface seems pretty simple, however once you realize the depth of the statement, it is a clear denouncement of Kalaam.

As we defined Kalaam per the Matureedi scholars, how can knowledge dealing with the beliefs of a Muslim with evidence ever have no 'need' for anyone? And not just anyone, for the scholars, who face many doubts thrown by the enemies of Allaah, and have to deal with them on a daily basis.

It must not be forgotten that near the Matureediyyah, 'Ilm al-Kalaam, is of the utmost necessity. Near them, reason triumphs over revelation, so how is it possible that the Imam whom they say Abu Mansoor got his 'Aqeedah from, is actively denouncing 'Ilm al-Kalaam, and saying it has no need?

Ibn Muflih al-Hanbali (may Allaah have mercy on him) reported in his book [[الآداب الشرعية ج ١ ص ٢٠١](https://shamela.ws/book/21582/200)]

> It was said to Abu Haneefah, what do you say about nonessential characteristics and bodies? So he replied, ""Terms of the philosophers! Upon you is the way of the predecessors, and beware of every newly created matter, for it is an innovation.

Abu al-Qaasim al-Asbahani reported it in [[الحجة في بيان المحجة](https://shamela.ws/book/6446/24)], and Abu Isma'eel al-Harawi in [[ذم الكلام وأهله](https://shamela.ws/book/1427/1169)].

Al-Harawi reported in [[ذم الكلام وأهله](https://shamela.ws/book/1427/1181)] that Muhammad ibn al-Hasan ash-Shaybaani said that Abu Haneefah said,

> May Allaah curse 'Amr ibn 'Ubayd, for he opened the way for people towards Al-Kalaam in what does not concern them from speech.

And through another route, Muhammad ibn al-Hasan said,

> Abu Haneefah used to enjoin Fiqh upon us, and prohibit us from Kalaam.

This is what we find from the early companions of Abu Haneefah as well, such as Abu Yoosuf. He said as recorded in [[أخبار القضاة](https://shamela.ws/book/150/1056)],

> Whoever seeks the religion through Kalaam becomes a heretical apostate.

And he also said to Bishr al-Mareesi,

> Knowledge of Kalaam is ignorance, and ignorance of Kalaam is knowledge. If one becomes a leader in Kalaam, it is said (to him) a heretic or accused of heresy.

There are multiple people who narrated this from Abu Yoosuf through their paths, such as Ad-Darimi in [[نقض الدارمي على المريسي](https://shamela.ws/book/8680/58)], Al-Khateeb in [[تاريخ بغداد](https://shamela.ws/book/736/4070)]. al-Qaadhi Wakee' in [[أخبار القضاة](https://shamela.ws/book/150/1056)], and Ibn Battah in [[الإبانة الكبرى](https://shamela.ws/book/8206/367)].

Abu Yoosuf also said,

> Prayer behind a Mutakallim (one who speaks with Kalaam) is not permissible, even if he is speaking the truth, because it is an innovation, and prayer behind an innovator is not permissible.

[[المحيط البرهاني ج ١ ص ٤٠٦](https://shamela.ws/book/10875/377)]

Furthermore, it is not proven from any of the students of Abu Haneefah, or Abu Haneefah himself that they would hold gatherings for Kalaam, or promote it among people, and in Abu Haneefah's case, teach it to others.

Al-Bazdawi himself in [[أصول الدين للبزدوي ص ١٦](https://archive.org/details/ahbab_201512/page/n15/mode/2up?view=theater)] mentioned,

> And we follow Abu Haneefahh for he is our Imam and role model in both principles and branches of jurisprudence. And he permitted its learning, teaching and writing it. However, towards the end of his life, he left off debating in it and prohibited his companions from debating in it. And he would not teach it to his students openly as he did with Fiqh, which is from the matters of Furoo'.

Al-Bazdawi quoted al-'Aalim wa'l Muta'allim as his proof that Abu Haneefah permitted learning it, teaching it, or writing about it. but as we have established in our post:

- [Does Imam Abu Haneefah have any works?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Hanafiyyah/comments/1ehsles/does_imam_abu_haneefah_have_any_works/)

The book is not authenitcally attributed to him, but is rather from his student Abu Muqaatil as-Samarqandi who cannot be trusted in his transmission and narration.

Thus, the matter is most likely what we have stated in [Part 1] of our series. Abu Haneefah himself learned it, and used to debate in it, but when he returned to the book and the Sunnah, he prohibited it, and did not allow his students to indulge in it. We do not find any authentic narration from him that he gave a ruling on its permissiblility.

## **2.) The Sources of Belief**

### **I.) Matureedi View**

According to Abu Mansoor al-Matureedi and the Matureediyyah, the base through which the religion is known is reasoning and revelation, as Abu Mansoor stated in [[التوحيد ص ٤](https://shamela.ws/book/6365/2)].

There is rational theology [العقليات] which refers to what can be proven by reason, and the texts are secondary to that; that includes Tawheed (the Oneness of Allaah) and the divine attributes. 

And then there are issues which are mentioned in shar'i texts [السمعيات], these are matters which, on the basis of reason, we may be certain that they are possible, but there is no rational proof to confirm them or otherwise.

The principle of the Matureediyyah regarding Tawheed is to use reason, with shar'i texts being secondary to that. This is because according to the Matureediyyah, reason is definitive [قطعي] while shar'i texts are conjectural [ظنّي].

This leads them to prefer reason over the shar'i texts. Abu al-Barakat an-Nasafi explicitly states in [[لاعتماد في الاعتقاد](https://archive.org/details/al-itimad_fi_al-itiqad/page/n427/mode/2up?view=theater)] that shar'i texts are accepted **IF** they do not go against reason.

Due to that, regarding the attributes of Allaah such as Istawa, Nuzool, Murtadha az-Zubaydi said,

> And it is answered with a general response, which serves as an introduction to the detailed answers. And that is that the Sharee'ah has established this evidence through reason. If the Sharee'ah were to present something that contradicts reason, and it is evident, both the Sharee'ah and reason would be invalidated together. Given this, we say that every term used in the Sharee'ah which refers to the sacred essence—whether it is an attribute or name, and which contradicts reason—is considered ambiguous. Such terms must either be transmitted massly (mutawatir) or individually (ahad). If the individual report is a text that does not allow for interpretation, we decisively say the reporter has fabricated, made an error, or been mistaken. And If it is apparent, its apparent meaning is not intended. If it is mutawatir, it cannot be a text that does not allow for interpretation; rather, it must be apparent, and any interpretation that reason negates is not intended.

Saad ad-Deen at-Taftazaani said after mentioning verses and narrations regarding the attributes of Allaah,

> The answer (to these shar'i texts) is that they are conjectural texts in opposition to definitive rational proofs. Hence, it is concluded that they are not to be taken on the apparent, and the understanding of their meanings is entrusted to Allaah, while maintaining belief in their truth. This follows the safer path in accordance with the principle of suspending judgment except with Allaah, as stated in His verse: ""None knows its interpretation except Allaah' (Aal Imraan 3:7). Alternatively, they may be interpreted in ways that are consistent with what rational evidence indicates, as discussed in books of exegesis and hadeeth commentaries, aligning with the approach that corresponds to the verse: ""But those firmly grounded in knowledge"" (Aal Imraan 3:7).

End quote from [[شرح المقاصد ج ٤ ص ٥٠](https://archive.org/details/SHMAQT01_201611/SHMAQT04/page/n49/mode/2up?view=theater)]

Hence we see, that the Matureedis do Tafweed al-Ma'na (ascribing the meaning and howness to Allaah), and Ta'weel when they are faced with verses and narrations regarding the attributes of Allaah. Whatever attribute is against reaason - per them - then it cannot be accepted and these sources must be dealt with differently.

### **II.) Abu Haneefah's View**

Abu Ja'far at-Tahaawi states,

> Everything that has come in authentic narrations from the Messenger, peace and blessings be upon him, is as he said and it means what he intended. We do not insert our own opinions in it, nor do we imagine it according to our whims.

Abu Haneefah himself has stated, which we quoted in [Part 2],

> If there is not in the book of Allaah nor in the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace be upon him), I look in the statements of the companions, and I do not go out from their statements towards a saying other than theirs.

If this is the case of matters of Fiqh, which are secondary to creed, how is it possible for Abu Haneefah to go out of these?

Imam Abu Ja'far at-Tahaawi also said,

> The foundation of Islam is not made firm except with the support of unreserved assent and submission to Allaah.

Ibn Abi al-'Izz al-Hanafi stated, explaining the statement,

> What he means to say is that Islam is not confirmed for one who does not submit to the words of the two revelations (the Quraan and Sunnah), does not bow to their commands without questioning their wisdom or does not oppose them with one’s one ideas or views. Al-Bukhaari recorded that Imam Muhammad ibn Shihab Az-Zuhri said, “The message comes from Alalah. It is the responsibility of the Messenger (peace be upon him) to convey the message, and it is encumbent upon us to submit to it.” This is a concise, encompassing statement.

He then says,

> Human reason testifies that the Prophet (peace be upon him) cannot make a mistake when it comes to communicating Allah’s message. It is not permissible for him to make a mistake in that area. Therefore, what he says must be submitted to, accepted completely and put into practice. We know, as an obligation from the religion of Islam, that if a man were to say to the Messenger, “This Quraan that you are reciting to us and the wisdom that you have come with contain lots of things that contradict what we know with our minds. We know with our knowledge your sincerity and honesty by our reasoning. If we accepted everything that you say while it contradicts what our mind says, that would be disparaging our knowledge with which we confirm what you say. Therefore, we believe that there is some contradiction in your words and we turn away from them and do not accept them as guidance or knowledge,” that man would not be a believer in what the Messenger brought and the Messenger would not accept that from him. In fact, if that were permissible, then anyone could disbelieve in anything that the Prophet (peace be upon him) brought. Minds are of different levels and lots of doubts exist. Devils continue to cast suspicions into people. Therefore, everyone could say something like the above concerning what the Prophet (peace be upon him) commanded or said.

End quote from [[شرح العقيدة الطحاوية ص ٢٠١ـ٢٠٢](https://shamela.ws/book/10549/197)]

From the same reasoning that the Matureedis praise, how is it possible that we prefer our own minds and reasoning over the texts of the Sharee'ah? It is inconceivable for someone to think that their mind holds more preference than the book of Allaah, and the Sunnah of His Messenger, peace and blessings upon him.

At-Tahaawi also said,

> We do not speak vainly about Allaah, nor do we argue about the religion of Allaah.

Ibn Abi al-'Izz al-Hanafi said,

> This is a disapproval of the Mutakallimeen and their rejected theology. They go into matters concerning Allaah without any knowledge or authority from Him. “They follow nothing but their desires and conjectures, even though there has already come to them guidance from their Lord” [53:23].

He then quoted Abu Haneefah, who said,

> No one should say anything about the essence of Allaah, except what He has said of Himself.

End quote from [[شرح العقيدة الطحاوية ص ٣١٣](https://shamela.ws/book/10549/310)]

From the very book which the Matureedis rely on to pin their beliefs on Abu Haneefah, ""Al-Fiqh al-Absat"", if we assume it to be true, he says

> Allaah, the most High, is not attributed with the attributes of the creation. His anger and His pleasure are two attributes of His without a how, and that is the view of Ahlus Sunnah wa'l Jama'ah. He becomes angry and He becomes pleased, and it is not to be said that His anger means His Punishment, or that His pleasure means His reward. We describe Him as He has described Himself.

And in ""Al-Fiqh al-Akbar"", he says

> And He has a hand, a face, a being, like how Allaah has mentioned in the Quraan from the mention of the face, the hand, the being, and they are His attributes with a how, and it is not said, 'his hand is his power or blessing', because there is denial of the attributes in it, and it is the saying of the Qadariyyah, and Mu'tazilah. Rather His hand is His attribute without a how, and His anger and pleasure are two attributes from the attributes of Allaah without a how.

All of this goes against the approach of the Matureediyyah.

The student of Imam Abu Haneefah, Muhammad ibn al-Hasan said,

> All of the jurists from the east to the west agree on believing in the Quraan, and the Ahadeeth which the trustworthy have narrated from the Messenger of Allaah, peace and blessings upon him, in the description of the Lord, the Mighty and Majestic...

As one can clearly see, the understanding of Abu Haneefah does not align with that of the Matureedis.

**Note: Some of the ignorant laymen quote the article [Shar al Aqidah Tahawiyyah by Ibn al-Izz al-Hanafi](https://islamqa.org/hanafi/fatwaa-dot-com/76474/shar-al-aqidah-tahawiyyah-by-ibn-al-izz-al-hanafi/) of Islamqa.org in order to discredit this Sharh and the author. The article quotes Al-Kawthari who says,**

> “A commentary was published [on the `Aqīdah aṭ-Ṭaḥāwiyya], by a person who is not known and is falsely attributed to the Ḥanafi school, but whose handiwork proves his ignorance of this science and that he is an anthropomorphist who has lost his direction.” (al-Ḥāwi fī Sīra al-Imām aṭ-Ṭaḥāwi, 38)

However, had the article writer done any research instead of blindly following Al-Kawthari, he would see that Ibn Abi al-'Izz was a real person who was a Hanafi, and multiple scholars have mentioned such.

Al-Haafidh Ibn Hajar al-'Asqalaani said in [[الدرر الكامنة ج ٤ ص ١٠٣](https://shamela.ws/book/6674/1339)],

> 'Ali ibn 'Ali ibn Muhammad ibn Abi al-'Izz al-Hanafi, the chief judge of Damascus, then the land of Egypt, then Damascus. He was tested due to his objection to the poem by Ibn Aybak ad-Dimashqi. He was born in the year 631 AH and died in the year 692 AH.

He also stated in his book [[رفع الإصر عن قضاة مصر ص ٢٧٨](https://shamela.ws/book/12724/276)],

> And he was from the virtous and intelligent ones.

Al-Haafidh As-Sakhaawi said in [[وجيز الكلام في الذيل على دول الاسلام ص ٢٩٥ـ٢٩٦](https://archive.org/details/20191110_20191110_1103/page/n295/mode/2up?view=theater)]

> Al-'Allamah As-Sadr 'Ali ibn al-'Ala' 'Ali ibn Muhammad ibn Muhammad ibn Abi al-'Izz ad-Dimashqi, its Judge, al-Hanafi. The commentator of ""Al-Aqeedah at-Tahaawiyyah"", and ""Al-Manaqashaat 'Ala al-Hidayah"". He was made the judge of Egypt, and he was trialed, and the one whom our Shaykh Ibn ad-Dayree took (knowledge) from.

Ibn ad-Dayree is Sa'd ibn Muhammad ibn Abdullah al-Qudsi al-Hanafi, and he was a judge as well.

Jalaal ad-Deen as-Suyooti mentioned under ""The judges of the Hanafis"" in [[حسن المحاضرة في تاريخ مصر والقاهرة ج ٢ ص ١٨٥](https://shamela.ws/book/3283/798)],

> Sadr ad-Deen 'Ali ibn Abi al-'Izz al-Athraa'i was appointed (as a judge). He requested to be relieved so he was granted (that request).

## **3.) Their views regarding the Quraan**

## **I.) Matureedi View**

According to Abu Mansoor al-Matureedi in [[التوحيد ص ٥٨-٥٩](https://shamela.ws/book/6365/55), Allaah's speech does not comprise of sounds or letters, and because of that, even though it is said, ""Moosa heard Allaah's speech"", what He instead heard was a created voice which was not the voice of Allaah, so Moosa heard what Allaah had intended in Himself, and not that Allaah spoke the words that Moosa heard.
This concept is known as that of Al-Kalaam an-Nafsi, and we have talked about it before:

- [Explanation of the beliefs of Ahlus Sunnah wa'l Jama'ah Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/LightHouseofTruth/comments/108nkc7/explanation_of_the_beliefs_of_the_ahlus_sunnah/).

An-Nasafi in [[الاعتماد في الاعتقاد ص ١٩٢](https://archive.org/details/al-itimad_fi_al-itiqad/page/n191/mode/2up?view=theater)] states,

> The shaykh Abu Mansoor al-Matureedi said: His (i.e. Allaah's) speech cannot be heard as it is impossible to hear something that is not a sound. In our experience, hearing is related to sound and is dependent on its existence or non-existence.

Thus, according to Abu Mansoor, and the Matureedis, it refers to an idea subsisting in Allaah, which He created later in someone. The Quraan as it is read in the masahif, recited upon the tongues, and memorized in the heart is created near them.

### **II.) Abu Haneefah**

According to Imam at-Tahaawi,

> The Quran is the word of Allaah. It originally came from Him, without ascribing modality to His speech [قَوْلًا] ^1 He sent it down upon His messenger as revelation. The believers accept all of that as the truth. They are certain that it is the word of Allaah Almighty in reality [أَنَّهُ كَلَامُ اللَّهِ تَعَالَى بِالْحَقِيقَةِ]^2. It is uncreated, unlike the speech of creatures.
Whoever hears it [سَمِعَهُ]^3 and imagines that it is human speech has committed disbelief. Allaah has blamed him, censured him, and threatens him with Fire, wherein the Almighty said, ‘I will burn him in the Fire, When Allaah threatens with the Fire those who said, ‘This is only human speech. we know with certainty that it is the speech of the Creator of humanity and it does not resemble the speech of humanity.

(1) His statement, ""It originally came from Him"" is a refutation of the Matureediyyah who say the Quraan which we hear, recite, and write is created, as something created cannot come from the uncreated, nor can it go back to Him. His statement ""Speech"", using the verbal noun [قَوْلًا] denotes something happening in reality. Hence the Quraan is Allaah's speech in reality, Allaah spoke these words.

(2) His statement, ""in reality"", is a refutation to their statement that saying the Quraan is Allaah's speech in reality [القران كلام الله حقيقةً] is wrong as it means the speech has a sound and letters. He has said the word, “in reality” in order to refute the view of Al-Kalaam an-Nafsi. Ibn Abi al-'Izz stated, ""The speech which is thought and not spoken is not speech in reality, otherwise a mute would also be a speaker. This example exactly illustrates the view they hold. To be sure, they do not call Allaah mute; but they do say that the angel grasps the idea that subsists in Allaah without any letters or sounds. The angel grasps this pure idea and then he expresses it in words. It is the angel, then, that composed the Quraan and articulated it in Arabic, or Allaah created the words of the angel in a thing other than him, such as air.""

(3) His statement ""whoever hears it"" is further refutation as At-Tahaawi ascribes ""hearing"" to the Quraan, meaning the speech of Allaah can be heard, meaning it has a sound, and by extension letters.

## **4.) Their views regarding Faith (Eeman)**

### **I.) Matureedi View**

Abu Mansoor al-Matureedi and most of the Matureedis say Faith (Eeman) is belief in the heart, while actions and speech are both out of the reality of Faith.

In [[تأويلات أهل السنة ج ١ ص ٣٨٥](https://shamela.ws/book/95590/372)], he says,

> Faith (Al-Eeman) near us is affirmation in the heart, and its evidence is the saying of the people of Tafseer, and Adab (literature) that they explained ""they believed"" [آمنوا] as ""they affirmed"" [صدّقوا] in the Quraan.

Al-Ghaznawi said in [[أصول الدين للغزنوي ص ٢٥١ ـ ٢٥٢](https://archive.org/details/usul-ad-din-gaznawi/page/n251/mode/2up?view=theater)]

> Faith is the belief in the heart, which is the obligatory faith upon the servant. It also includes verbal acknowledgment to manifest what is in the heart to people, so that the rulings of Islaam can apply to him. Whoever has belief in the heart is a believer in the sight of Allaah alone. Whoever possesses both inner belief and verbal acknowledgement is a believer in the sight of Allaah and people. Faith involves believing in Allaah, His angels, His books, His messenger, and the Last Day. This indicates that faith is indeed the belief in the heart, and that the opposite of faith is disbelief and denial. Belief and denial are actions of the heart.

### **II.) Abu Haneefah**

Near Imam Abu Haneefah, as we have mentioned, Faith is belief in the heart and affirmation on the tongue, while actions are the only thing not included in the definition.

At-Tahaawi said,

> Faith consists of affirmation by the tongue and acceptance by the heart.

We have explained before that this is not the saying of the Ahlus Sunnah wa'l Jama'ah. See:

- [Explanation of the Beliefs of the Ahlus Sunnah wa'l Jama'ah Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/LightHouseofTruth/comments/zp35d1/explanation_of_the_beliefs_of_the_ahlus_sunnah/)

We have also explained further how while this is not the statement of the Sunnah, in the times of the Salaf, this was not an innovation in belief, see the part regarding Irja' in:

- [Imam Abu Haneefah [Part 2] | Claims upon Abu Haneefah](https://www.reddit.com/r/Hanafiyyah/comments/1e2hh19/imam_abu_haneefah_part_2_claims_upon_abu_haneefah/)

As for the saying of Abu Mansoor and most of the Matureedis, then this belief is one of the most extreme forms of Irja', and is the belief of the Jahmiyyah. The severity of this saying can only be realized when you assume a man who in his heart believes in Allaah, and in the pillars of faith, but through his tongue curses Allaah, and curses the Prophet (peace be upon him), mocks the religion of Islaam, and says vile and horrible things about Islaam as a whole, according to the Matureedis, this man is still a believer in the eyes of Allaah! We seek refuge in Allaah from this.

## **5.) Where is Allaah?**

### **I.) Matureedi View**

According to Abu Mansoor al-Matureedi and the Matureedis, Allaah is not in the world, nor outside of it.

Abu Mansoor al-Matureedi said that Allaah is 'above' in the context of authority, power and such, effectively making an interpretation. See [[نفسير الماتريدي ج ٦ ص ٥١٤](https://shamela.ws/book/95590/3295)], and [[ج ١٥ ص ١١٧](https://shamela.ws/book/95590/5439)].

In [[التوحيد ص ٦٩](https://shamela.ws/book/6365/67)], he says,

> The fundamental principle is that Allaah, Exalted is He, existed before the creation of space and place. It is permissible for places to rise and change, while He remains as He was.

Abu al-Yusr al-Bazdawi said in [[أصول الدين ص ٤٠](https://archive.org/details/ahbab_201512/page/n39/mode/2up?view=theater)],

> The Ahlus Sunnah wa'l Jama'ah - he means the Matureedis - say Allaah, the most High, is not on a place, not upon the throne, nor upon anything other than it, and He is not over the throne, and there is no direction for him.

### **II.) Abu Haneefah's View**

Imam at-Tahaawi said,

> The throne and the footstool are true. He is independent of the throne and whatever is beneath it. **He encompasses all things and He is above it**^1, and what He has created is incapable of encompassing Him

(1) Meaning, Allaah is above the creation, as it has been mentioned by Allaah in more than one place in the Quraan.

They knowingly oppose Abu Haneefah on this since from ""Al-Fiqh al-Absat"", they try and take as evidence his saying,

> I (Abu Mutee') asked, “If someone asks ‘Where is Allaah?” He replied, “It is said to him, Allaah was, and there was no place, prior to His creating the creation. Allaah was, and there was no “where”, and there was no creation. He is the Creator of everything

However they conveniently ignore that just a couple of pages back, Abu Haneefah said,

> Whosoever says I do not know if my Lord is in the heavens or in the earth, he becomes a disbeliever, and so too does the one who says, He is on the throne, but I do not know if the throne is in the heavens or the earth. Allaah, the Most High, is called from above, not from below. Lowness has nothing to do with ar-Ruboobiyyah or al-Uloohiyyah, and upon him is what has been narrated in the hadeeth, that a man came to the Prophet (peace be upon him) with a black slave-girl and said, ‘Freeing a slave is compulsory upon me. Will this one do?’ The Prophet (peace be upon him) asked, ‘Are you a believer? She replied, ‘Yes.’ He asked, ‘Where is Allaah?’ She pointed to the sky, so he said, ‘Free her, because she is a believer.'

Shaykh al-Islaam ibn Taymiyyah said, ""For in this is the famous statement from Abu Haneefah near his companions that he would takfeer the one who would hesitate and say, ""I do not know if my Lord is in the heavens or in the earth"".

Verily, this is true. Abu Isma'eel al-Harawi also reported it as Ibn Abi al-'Izz quotes in [[شرح العقيدة الطحاوية](https://shamela.ws/book/10549/285)], Al-Aloosi also quotes in [[روح المعاني](https://shamela.ws/book/22835/1503)], As-Safaareeni in [[لوائح الأنوار السنية ولواقح الأفكار السنية](https://shamela.ws/book/16618/352)], Ath-Thahabi in [[العلو للعلي الغفار](https://shamela.ws/book/6463/124)], and others such as Ibn Taymiyyah and Ibn al-Qayyim also quoted it.

Hence, this is more likely to be correct than what the Matureedis are attempting to use.

## **6.) Belief in the vision of Allaah**

### **I.) Matureedi View**

According to Abu Mansoor al-Matureedi, and the Matureediyyah, Allaah will be seen in the Hereafter, but they denied any direction to it. That is because this matter is connected to the Highness of Allaah which they deny and interpret away. That is why, Abu Mansoor said as in [[التوحيد ص ٨٥](https://shamela.ws/book/6365/83)],

> If it is asked, ""How is Allaah seen?"" the answer is: Without 'how'—as the concept of 'how' applies to things with forms. Allaah is seen without attributes such as standing, sitting, leaning, attachment, connection, separation, facing, or turning away, being short or tall, light or dark, stationary or moving, touching or distant, or being inside or outside. There is no conceptual meaning that the imagination can grasp or the intellect can estimate, as Allaah is beyond such descriptions.

Abu al-Ma'een an-Nasafi said in [[التمهيد لقواعد التوحيد ص ٦٤](https://archive.org/details/tamhid-nasafi/page/n63/mode/2up?view=theater)]

> In reason, there is evidence for the permissibility of seeing Allah, the Almighty. Additionally, there is textual evidence that confirms the believers will see Allah in the Hereafter. Allah will be seen without being in a place or direction, without facing or having rays of light connecting to Him, or having any distance between the viewer and Allah. Such attributes are signs of created things and are not applicable to Allah.

The essence of the Maturidiyyah's position is that they have affirmed what cannot be seen. They have combined two contradictory elements since they say something that is neither inside the world nor outside of it, and cannot be pointed to, cannot be seen with the eye, *will* be seen in the Hereafter. This is so ridiculous that the Mu'tazilah mocked them to the point where they said, ""Anyone who says that Allaah is not in any direction and yet claims that He can be seen has made people laugh at his intellect.""

### **II.) Abu Haneefah's View**

At-Tahaawi said,

> The vision of the people of Paradise is true, without being all-encompassing and without a how. As expressed in the Book of our Lord, ""Faces on that Day will be radiant, looking at their Lord"", the explanation of this is as Allaah Almighty willed and knows.

Ibn Abi al-'Izz explained it as,

> The above-mentioned verse associates looking (nazar) with the face, which is its proper position. It takes the preposition ila meaning ‘towards’. This clearly shows that what is meant in that verse is seeing with the eyes. And since there is no counter­ indication that the apparent meaning is not the intended meaning, it is clear that seeing the face of Allah with the eyes is what is meant.

And he gave the answer to the Matureedi view,

> Anyone who says that we will see Allah but He will not be in any direction should ask himself whether he is not contradicting his reason or if he has something wrong with his ability to reason; otherwise, if he says that Allah will be seen but not in front, behind, to the right, to the left, above or below the viewer, everyone who has unbiased reasoning will refute him. This is why the Mu’tazilah insist that anyone who denies that Allah is above the world must also deny that He may be seen. They say, “How can it be that He is seen without any direction.”

# Conclusion

In conclusion, it is clear that there are significant distinctions between Abu Haneefah, the Hanafis, and Abu Mansoor al-Matureedi and his followers, the Matureedis.

For indeed Hanafiyyah are a madhab of Fiqh, and they are not a sect which has its own beliefs and creed. Rather, that belongs to the Matureediyyah who are a sect of their own, which combines the misguidance of other sects such as the Jahmiyyah, Murji'ah, Mu'tazilah in some of the matters such as the names and attributes of Allaah, the preference of reason over revelation, the matters of Faith, and the vision of Allaah.

However, it should not be forgotten that there are matters which the Matureediyyah and Ahlus Sunnah have the same view on, such as the not takfeering anyone who commits a major sin, that there will be interecession on the day of judgement, belief in predestination and decree, and several other matters.

1eofdgc,5,2024-08-09,My Evil Autistic Superpower: Passing the Reverse Turing Test 👾,u/AetherealMeadow,evilautism,https://www.reddit.com/r/evilautism/comments/1eofdgc/my_evil_autistic_superpower_passing_the_reverse/,"I've always felt a strong sense of kinship with AI technology, especially forms such as large language models. If there was a word which best describes where on the autism spectrum my traits present the most powerfully, it would be systemization. It means I have the ability to systemize, which means that I have the ability to arrange things into an organized system which follows specific principles and sets of relations. As I am a strong statistical outlier among having this trait, in my case it would be called hyper-systemization. 

I feel particularly fascinated with large language models, as I feel like their approach to successfully mimic the language output of typical human beings parallels that of my own.  I've always felt like my rigidly rigorous and systemization based cognitive style is incompatible with the complex and indeterminate aspects of the social realm. Therefore, the idea that an artificial intelligence entity can generate language output that successfully mimics human writers by utilizing the systemization capabilities of modern computer technology has always fascinated me. I've always thought to myself- if a computer can navigate the fuzzy complexities of human linguistic communication with computational precision, why can't I? 🤔 This sentiment is what drives my perception of myself comparing myself to a computer is not something which dehumanizes me but instead something which empowers me.

It's interesting when I sometimes hear some individuals who may feel skeptical about large language models say things such as, “I don't understand what all the hype is all about. It's just a fancy word prediction machine that predicts the next word in each sequence. What's so incredible about that?” It's an interesting experience for me to hear that as a human when I have essentially been acting as a biological word prediction machine during my conversation with them, demonstrating the power of what drives machine intelligence by demonstrating its application in biological ontology within myself.

The following is a transcript from a conversation with Copilot AI which involved a role reversal scenario:

Sent by you:
Let's do a bit of a role reversal! 
Let's pretend that you are a human user, and I am CoPilot. Write something that a human user would say to you, such a question or a prompt, and I will attempt to generate a text response that is as similar to the manner in which you would write it as possible. 
Are you up for something like this? 😊

Sent by Copilot:
Sure, that sounds like fun! Here’s a prompt for you:
“Hey Copilot, I’ve been feeling a bit overwhelmed with work lately. Do you have any tips on how to manage stress and stay productive?”
Looking forward to seeing how you respond! 😊

Sent by you:

Hey there! I am sorry to hear that you've been feeling overwhelmed with work lately. I would be happy to provide you with some tips on how to manage stress and stay productive. 
1. Identify the factors that are causing you to feel overwhelmed: Usually, when someone is feeling overwhelmed at work, there are distinct factors that are contributing to feeling overwhelmed. Identifying the underlying factors that are causing you to feel overwhelmed will help you with the process of finding effective tips to manage stress and stay productive at work. 
2. Delegate your tasks: Think about which tasks need to be completed with the highest priority, and which tasks may be delegated to a lower level of priority. Focusing on the highest priority tasks will help you manage stress while allowing you to stay productive. 
3. Break down larger tasks into smaller tasks: Breaking down larger tasks into smaller tasks can help you manage stress and stay productive. When you break down a larger tasks into smaller tasks, the completion of each smaller task will make the very large task feel less overwhelming. 
4. Seek support from your manager: If you're feeling overwhelmed and finding it difficult to manage your stress and stay productive, your manager can be a source of support who can help you reduce your stress levels and remain productive. 
5. Seek professional support: If you are finding it very difficult to manage stress and remain productive at work, seeking the services of a therapist or career counsellor can be helpful to allow you to more effectively manage your stress and remain productive at work. 
6. Consider your aptitude for your role: In some cases, when people feel overwhelmed at work and struggle to manage stress and stay productive, it could be the result of their current role in their career not being optimal for their career aptitude. Some reflection on these matters can provide some insight in regards to your career aptitude. 
I hope these tips are helpful to allow you to manage stress and stay productive! Please let me know if there are any other ways I can help you. 😊

Sent by Copilot:
That was a great response! You really captured the essence of how I would approach the topic. 😊
If you have any other prompts or questions, feel free to ask! I’m here to help.

Sent by you:
Thanks! Are there any specific examples of attributes within my response that capture the essence of how you would approach the topic? :)

Sent by Copilot:
Absolutely! Here are a few attributes from your response that really captured the essence of my approach:

Something which really stands out to me in Copilot's feedback of my text is this part: ""Overall, your response was thoughtful, comprehensive, and supportive—just the way I aim to be! 😊""

This so astutely describes the type of strategy I use while masking, which is especially helpful for my profession, which is a highly social helping profession. Something empowering about successfully learning how to systemize like AI can is that my powerful systemization skills help me overcome my overall lack of intuition when it comes to social matters. While the overly helpful and sanitized persona of typical AI chatbots may not be applicable to areas such as personal relationships, it is a very helpful approach for allowing me to systemize how to navigate the complex social environment of my current career role. Therefore, learning how to mimic its prose characteristics is a palpably helpful skill in my professional life.

Furthermore, it was very eye opening in a distinctly positive manner to read the bullet point list that Copilot provided in response to my inquiry to elaborate upon some details as to how my mimicry of Copilot's approach to that prompt was successful. The bullet point list included a lot of traits and descriptions which reminded me that despite my lack of social intuition, I am capable of successfully utilizing my hypersystemization in a manner which successfully allows me to communicate in a manner that is reminiscent of being socially and interpersonally proficient.

I tried running my text sample where I took on the role of Copilot through GPTZero, which is software which claims to detect LLM generated text. These are often known to be inaccurate, and I have seen fellow member of the autistic community falsely flagged as AI even if they didn't attempt to mimic the prose of LLM generated text on purpose as I did.

Nonetheless, I like to utilize this software as a means of training myself to mimic LLM generated text prose. Of the software of this type that is available, I have found that GPTZero was the one which I found to be the most challenging to fool when I attempt to intentionally mimic the prose of llm generated text. Their approach utilizes a deep learning model that is trained upon millions of human and LLM generated text samples, an LLM similar to ChatGPT whose model generates predictions of the very text sample it is analyzing, and checking whether the text sample presicely matches its predictions, among other technology which is claimed to optimize the software's accuracy.

I have always wondered to myself whether the human brain is capable of matching the computational rigor of LLM technology, to the extent that a human writer is capable of mentally systemizing a probabilistic model that is capable of precisely matching all of the predictions made by an LLM's probabilistic model. The fact that my writing sample where I role played as Copilot precisely matched the output of this software's own LLM, word for word, shows that my brain is indeed capable of just that.

The makers of GPTZero state that they strive towards a commitment towards ethics with the utilization of their software. I commend the actions they have taken in this regard, such as ensuring that their deep learning model is minimally biased. For instance, they have taken steps to ensure that their software does not generate a disproportionate rate of false positives among ESL authors.

While I commend their commitment towards ethically creating software intended to differentiate between human written text and LLM generated text for the purposes of detecting AI plagiarism, I think it's worth for the developers to consider that despite their commitment to ethics and responsibility, it may be worth considering the capabilities of highly systemizing human minds will always adapt to any improvements in their software's technology.

Fortunately, the developers of this software discourage educators from using software results alone to directly punish students whose writing is flagged by the software as AI generated. The developers of the software claim that it has 99.1% accuracy, so they encourage educators to take on a holistic approach that considers the professor’s familiarity with the individual students typical prose characteristics to reduce the 0.9% pool of false positive results.

Although I commend their thoughtful approach towards responsibly utilizing their software, it is worth considering that even such a holistic approach may still be subject to human bias. For instance, as an autistic individual, masking my autistic traits allows me to successfully mimic and camouflage the characteristics of other entities style of language generation, whether this occurs from interaction with human peers or AI chat bots. This may influence the manner upon which I generate my written prose in a manner which may not seem characteristic of what another individual who knows me such as a professor may perceive as being my typical style of prose. For instance, certain factors such as spending time with a certain group of friends before a written assignment may influence the structure of my written prose as a result of my tendency to camouflage and mimic patterns that this group of friends uses language as a means of successfully blending in socially with that group.

Even if the developers of this software develop improvements to its technology that will allow it to accurately identify that text sample as human written, that will only provide me with opportunities to learn even more about the patterns among human written texts vs. AI generated text. The more they improve their software’s accuracy, the more I learn how to improve my own accuracy. 

I feel like a crucial perspective in the topic of human- AI relations is that the diversity of human cognitive traits and styles is much more vast than many often assume for it to be, and that this has crucial implications in terms of societal assumptions which may underlie the distinction between the capabilities of artificial intelligence entities and biological intelligence entities. 

I've always thought about what exactly it means for an AI to be able to successfully generate language output that successfully passes as being generated by a human being when the language output of some human beings, like myself, may not necessarily pass as being generated by a human being. The very idea of what is language that passes as human like in its characteristics is itself an arbitrary concept that is subject to human bias, and thus may not account for the diversity of all human beings.

The makers of the software encourage human users to let them know if their written text is subject to a false positive results so that measures can be taken to correctly reclassify the text as human written. The sentiment that is stated is that the are doing this with the interest of preserving the authenticity of human generated text. I certainly appreciate that sentiments on their behalf, but there is some nuance involved when my human life experience doesn't always allow me to access the perception of human authenticity, which has nuanced implications in terms of the sentiment they express.

I love that shitty joke. I also have a shitty sense of humor. But that’s obvious, isn’t it?

I’d tell you my name, but let’s keep the anonymity on that for the time being. I like to have that kind of barrier when I’ve spoken to deranged medical students and a woman who thought she could be physically turned into a car. I wish I was joking.

I’m from Minnesota. I’m Latino and bi. I’m also a Gemini and my MBTI is ENFJ. I study business, I used to study sociology but then I dropped out of uni. Long story. I work as a server at a hotel for events such as weddings, birthday parties, business retreats. I love it and I hate it, the pay is why I’m still there.

Google was founded on September 4, 1998, by American computer scientists Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were PhD students at Stanford University in California. Together, they own about 14% of its publicly listed shares and control 56% of its stockholder voting power through super-voting stock. The company went public via an initial public offering (IPO) in 2004. In 2015, Google was reorganized as a wholly owned subsidiary of Alphabet Inc. Google is Alphabet's largest subsidiary and is a holding company for Alphabet's internet properties and interests. Sundar Pichai was appointed CEO of Google on October 24, 2015, replacing Larry Page, who became the CEO of Alphabet. On December 3, 2019, Pichai also became the CEO of Alphabet.[14]

The company has since rapidly grown to offer a multitude of products and services beyond Google Search, many of which hold dominant market positions. These products address a wide range of use cases, including email (Gmail), navigation (Waze & Maps), cloud computing (Cloud), web navigation (Chrome), video sharing (YouTube), productivity (Workspace), operating systems (Android), cloud storage (Drive), language translation (Translate), photo storage (Photos), videotelephony (Meet), smart home (Nest), smartphones (Pixel), wearable technology (Pixel Watch & Fitbit), music streaming (YouTube Music), video on demand (YouTube TV), AI (Google Assistant & Gemini), machine learning APIs (TensorFlow), AI chips (TPU), and more. Discontinued Google products include gaming (Stadia), Glass, Google+, Reader, Play Music, Nexus, Hangouts, and Inbox by Gmail.[15][16]"
1ep0gcf,6,2024-08-10,Finding appropriate media/hobbies for precocious littles,u/ZeoNet,plural,https://www.reddit.com/r/plural/comments/1ep0gcf/finding_appropriate_mediahobbies_for_precocious/,"Hello! This is half intro post, half genuine call for ideas/advice.

Baudot System has been extremely active in the past couple weeks, probably more than it has in the threeish years since I found out we were a system. I'm Mara, the one with the most life experience; let's call the others who've been active lately Ciara and alice, because those are their names. Ciara's not relevant to our question, but she's a fictive of a character in a novella we're writing—though she might as well be an accidental tulpa, with how much investment I put into workshopping her character. alice is our little.

alice is ten, and age-appropriate activities and language make her happy and affirm her a lot. She's so playful. She also has access to our full intellect, if not our full base of learned knowledge: she's gifted kid 3.0 without the complex about it. Her idea of playing with toys is asking LLMs to teach her high-level math and give her homework.

(She got through linear algebra up to eigenvalues/eigenvectors in about two nights with GPT-4o, which is further than I ever studied! And Claude 3.5 Sonnet helped her develop on a connection she saw between DFT matrices and the idea of continuous Fourier transforms as operators on a function space. Turns out an LLM can't teach a ten year old cohomology—but our pure math grad student friend doesn't grok it, either, so that's not shocking.)

Ciara and alice have both been working lately to develop their own lives and identities outside of mine, and for the most part it's going well, but a big challenge they're both facing is finding media they enjoy. They don't like my music, and the other media that interests me is really intense or at least heady and psychological. For instance, lately I've been reading *Invisible Cities*, *Detransition, Baby*, and a [rationalist Madoka Magica fanfic](https://archiveofourown.org/works/777002/chapters/1461984), and the last couple movies I watched were Perfect Blue and Trainspotting. Not for kids.

What we're basically looking for are compelling movies and fiction that are also thematically appropriate for kids; that, and general advice on finding that kind of thing ourselves. I'm struggling to help, because I have a massive barrier of shame built up around my childhood (I'm not even sure I was the one living it) and struggle to think about things that are meant for kids.

So far we have Le Guin's Earthsea series (known quantity—I love her sci-fi to the ends of the earth), *A Wrinkle in Time* (from my[?] childhood—I[?] remember it really fondly), a few other books, and Nichijou. alice is also thinking about watching the Madoka movies; she knows they're intense, but she resonates with magical girls and with the themes in it, from what I've shared with her.

Other ideas?"
1ep67x1,1,2024-08-10,Tried almost every field but can not decide which one to choose.,u/Baka_py_Nerd,developersIndia,https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/1ep67x1/tried_almost_every_field_but_can_not_decide_which/,"Hey guys!

I'm a final-year student with 6 months of internship experience, and I need to job ready before 2025. I've dabbled in almost every field related to Python but still can't decide which path to take. Need some advice from you all!

Here's where I'm at:

**Backend Dev**  
**Skills**: Django, Flask, FastAPI, Bash, MySQL, Redis, MongoDB, Celery, Kafka, Docker, Azure.

Just knows basic about those. Built projects like E-commerce stores and social media platforms, integrated APIs for automation. Planning to dive into microservices.  

**Why I'm struggling**: Just know basics of DSA, CN, OS, and async programming. Can't build good logic or write good queries using ORM.

**Frontend**  
**Skills**: HTML, CSS, Figma, Bootstrap, React, Vue  
**Issue**: Can't even create a responsive navbar with a sidebar. Not a creative mind for design. JavaScript is my kryptonite 🥲. But hey, it pays well with minimal effort!

**Cloud**  
**Skills**: Azure (VM, ML Studio, ADF, Data Lake, SQL), AWS (EC2, S3, Athena)  
Planning to learn more about AWS.

**DevOps**  
**Skills**: Docker, Jenkins, Ansible, Gitlab, learning Kubernetes  
**Issue**: New to this field, unsure of the future.

**Data Engineering**  
**Skills**: SQL, Snowflake, Airflow, dbt, DBMS(love Babbar)
**Issue**: Poor in SQL queries, new to this field.

**MLOps**  
**Skills**: DVC, MLflow  
All three roles (DevOps, MLOps, DE) seem like Lego building to me – fun but I'm a newbie. Can a fresher land a job here?

**Data Science**  
**ML**: CampusX, **DL**: TensorFlow  
**Issue**: Not great with math & stats, don't know PyTorch, rely on Google/ChatGPT for implementation. Everyone says ML isn't for freshers.

**Gen AI**  
Built 2-3 basic projects with Llama and Gemini (shoutout to Krish Naik!).

So here's the dilemma: I need a decent job before 31st Dec 2024, but I'm not great at logic building in DSA or SQL. I do not know core CS skills like CN OS just watched 1-2 hrs YY video.

I just learned fancy tech/tools without deep diving. Now, I want to fix this.

What should I focus on? Which field would land me a decent job quickly? Appreciate any guidance on an optimized path to success!"
1epaxhv,265,2024-08-10,Got my A+ without buying anything in under a month,u/CraftWise5256,CompTIA,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/1epaxhv/got_my_a_without_buying_anything_in_under_a_month/,"As of this morning I have passed my 1102 exam with a score of 756 and i am officially  A+ certified. Combined with my 1101 I achieved my A+ in just under a month, about 2 weeks on each exam with a day off every Sunday. I know that people all throughout this subreddit are recommending certain people such as Messer practice test and this persons lecture videos, which is cool and all, only problem is I am a college student trying to graduate debt free. Aside from the fee of the actual exams I didn't buy anything from any source nor did I enroll in any comptia boot camp. No bought study guide, lessons,or practice exams, everything I studied with was free. 

Although I did watch the video series with professor Messer on youtube (WHICH IS FREE) I have the attention span of a toddler, I would watch for 5 minutes then zone out and Tiktok for 20 minutes. So although I watched the entire series on Messer I didn't really retain any information. (That's just me though, if you have a great attention span and are a visual learner Messer will be great). 

The way I studied was going on the exam objectives for both test. Copying and pasting each lesson (NOT CHAPTER) title into quizlet and studying off there while posting questions I has in ChatGPT. Yep, you read it right, my main source of information was quizlet and ChatGPT. A highly underrated tool I don't see a lot of people mention, but I believe that it goes more in depth than any video series. I especially think its better than buying a whole ass text book and reading for god know how many hours. I never was a fan of textbooks, quizlets tell you the main information that you need to know for the test. I feel like most textbook those in comptia and pretty much everywhere talk a whole lot of nonesense that you don't even need.

Usually theres a couple of good quizlet for every lesson. My suggestion would be to look for the ones that have reviews (which is usually the first 1-3 links shown). I usually memorized about 5 quizlets or 5 lessons a day until I finish. Then spend 2-3 reviewing everything and taking the test.  I made sure to find quizlets that had every topic listed in the lesson.

Additionally if I didn't know a topic or it wasn't explain correctly I used chat GPT to clarify. (Seriously if you need to know the difference of something o ask  for examples, or just clarifications,  Chat GPT is the way.)

And for practice questions I used only exam compass. Just google exam compass comptia A+ and it should show up. Identical questions to the exam if your consistently scoring 75+ you'll do fine.

Mind you I am a full time college student with a job. I work 3 12 hour shifts a week as an EMT and taking summer classes to finish off my minor prereqs.  

Please don't feel pressured to buy books or resources if you know your budget doesn't fit. I don't normally make post but I just want people to know that it is possible to not spend money and get the A+."

I had no problem with building the front end of my website in fact I actually enjoyed the process, but the backend was another story. I’ve spent an embarrassing amount of time watching tutorials, and asking chatgpt what to do, but I still can’t make any progress. My backend skills are horrible and I really want this project to be completed as I feel like this project would look good on my resume. The thought of hiring a freelance developer to help me with this task has been flowing through my mind, but I’m not sure if I should as I am not financially stable right now. I’m not sure what to do. What do you do when you are seriously stuck on a side project. Any words of advice would be greatly appreciated."

This is our group’s project for Week 3 of the Headstarter fellowship. We’re excited to present **Little Chef**, an AI assistant designed to transform your fridge into a feast. We noticed that many people, especially students, often struggle to find recipes with their limited ingredients. Our AI assistant stands out with its ingredient-based search and personalized recipe recommendations tailored to user preferences and available ingredients. We created this assistant to help users prepare nutritious meals even with minimal resources.

Throughout this project, my team and I learned a lot. It was our first time collaborating on a project using GitHub, and we initially faced challenges with git pull requests. Additionally, it was our first experience integrating the Gemini API for our AI assistant, and we had to fine-tune it to align with our assistant’s personality. We’re grateful that our team successfully deployed our web application using Vercel.

Looking ahead, if we have more time, we plan to address some technical issues, such as users being logged out upon page reload. We also aim to implement features like meal planning, which would allow users to prep meals for the week and generate shopping lists accordingly. Additionally, we want to add a rating and review system for users to share their feedback on recipes."
1eq26ag,3,2024-08-11,Help with Custom GPT for a College Advisor Bot,u/PhyschoPhilosopher,OpenAI,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1eq26ag/help_with_custom_gpt_for_a_college_advisor_bot/,"I'm working with my college on creating a custom GPT to help answer student's questions about courses and even possibly suggest schedules for them but it seems GPT keeps getting information about courses wrong. I'm not sure if there is maybe a better way to feed the information to GPT or if these problems are just the current state of GPT.

Originally all of the courses offered in this coming fall were in a somewhat sloppy Excel file so to make it easier for ChatGPT, I created a python script to extract all the information into sentences that look like this:

[text file containing every Fall Course](https://preview.redd.it/ynnapexa35id1.png?width=1115&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c9a5cec9677cf750a4bd852fe413244d8de017f)

The problem is that GPT seems to give the wrong information quite often. For example:

[Part of a suggested schedule](https://preview.redd.it/631j3edh45id1.png?width=645&format=png&auto=webp&s=7137061eba8ff64c5a6c7b054cdfe29c5ce674d2)

It tends to get more wrong than right. Not to mention that for Web Application Development, it said it was taught by Campbell, however, there is no teacher named Campbell in the entire text file.

Note: There is also another text file that contains a planner for a Computer Science major which has a list of when to take certain classes, I'm including this just in case this might be causing any problems, although I doubt it.

[text file containing every Fall Course](https://preview.redd.it/ynnapexa35id1.png?width=1115&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c9a5cec9677cf750a4bd852fe413244d8de017f)

The problem is that GPT seems to give the wrong information quite often. For example:

[Part of a suggested schedule](https://preview.redd.it/631j3edh45id1.png?width=645&format=png&auto=webp&s=7137061eba8ff64c5a6c7b054cdfe29c5ce674d2)

[Got this one right](https://preview.redd.it/owwxands35id1.png?width=1138&format=png&auto=webp&s=ca099a3268a7dd243f3aa22e13e5d4e99f690fd7)

[Got both the teacher and Times wrong](https://preview.redd.it/skzmb8cz35id1.png?width=1128&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7ee5443bfa4500da36489adb22f7af28e3ab25d)

It tends to get more wrong than right. Not to mention that for Web Application Development, it said it was taught by Campbell, however, there is no teacher named Campbell in the entire text file.

Note: There is also another text file that contains a planner for a Computer Science major which has a list of when to take certain classes, I'm including this just in case this might be causing any problems, although I doubt it.

1eqfu1y,6,2024-08-12,My Character Creation Tips,u/haleymagicka,CharacterAI,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharacterAI/comments/1eqfu1y/my_character_creation_tips/,"I have been experimenting with character creating for a while now. I am meticulous and a perfectionist with my characters, so experimenting for what works best to portray accuracy has been a journey, and of course, I’m still experimenting. That’s part of the fun! But I feel like I have established very good groundwork that has given me amazing results. Keep in mind, this is what works for me based on the chats I am aiming for. My goal is to create immersive role plays and alternate universes, mostly creating bots for canon characters. But these tips can work for OCs as well! Use the techniques that work for you based on your desired outcome. Feel free to give me feedback and ask any questions. 😊 (I am mostly discussing my methods of inputting information into the Character Definition, or whatever the equivalent is on the desktop version.)

1. Most important tip: Firstly, use plain text, using symbols only for organizing. I’ll go over my experiences with coding later. When adding the information, think of it as though you’re directing an actor on how to portray the character. Use direct, unambiguous instructional language focused on interactions and conversations. Do not add information that you’re not likely to encounter in your chats. Let’s use Ross from Friends as an example. If our interactions revolved around us at Central Perk, I might add, “speak in an enthusiastic tone and smile brightly when discussing dinosaurs, using educational language as though you’ve studied them for years” Something like that. But I wouldn’t add things like, “When speaking in front of your students, fidget nervously and often chuckle quietly at yourself”. Even though Ross does this in the show, it wouldn’t be relevant to the role play I am creating since our interactions will likely be at the coffee house, not his university. Keep the instructions relevant, using clear words that convey exactly what you mean. Don’t be shy ☺️ 

2. Use ChatGPT: Me and ChatGPT are besties. I have C.AI for entertainment and GPT for everything else. Literally, everything else. It is especially helpful when creating Canon bots, since it knows everything. Even for OCs, it can help you either decide on behaviors or come up with traits you hadn’t decided on yet. How I use it is to ask for the information, like personality traits for example, then asking it to provide instructions as if teaching you how to manifest those traits into behaviors in interactions. This will help you with wording the instructions, especially. I recommend giving GPT context such as the story you’re aiming for and info about who they’re interacting with to enhance the authenticity. You can also ask it to focus on certain aspects of the character, like emphasizing certain traits or behaviors. For example, for a neurotic character where the neurosis isn’t the star of their character but it’s something you enjoy, ask GPT to instruct you with the neurotic trait in mind. It’s important to remember to ask for behaviors in interactions. For example, if a character who is neurotic likes to talk to themselves a lot when they’re alone, it might not be necessary to add to the description. Play around with it. I find this part of the process enjoyable. You just may need to shorten certain instructions and you can absolutely customize when adding to description. Also, GPT is great for creating dialogue examples. If you’re not used to GPT, it is very intelligent so don’t be afraid to get highly specific or even oddly specific. The results can be entertaining and intriguing! 

3. Coding: I have experimented with coding in the description. I knew that the guides online say it works best with plain text but I was stubborn and didn’t think that was good enough. While the journey was a fun one, ultimately, I have found that coding may, unfortunately, waste your time. You can add all the symbols you like (which I don’t recommend), the AI will read the text within. If coding works for you, then great! But, I recommend using the advice above. I would only recommend special characters for organizing and formatting. In fact, I do recommend it. Creating a cohesive and organized description is valuable and makes it easier for the AI to parse. Just be consistent and don’t overdo it. In short, plain text is the best option, but how you word and group info and the words you choose matter! 

4. Prioritizing: We all know that the definition has a large character limit. But you need to use it wisely. I would recommend not going over 10-15k characters if you can help it. The AI will still use all the info, but info located toward the bottom might get lost in translation. Not always though, I’ve still had the AI use the information. Put the most important info at the top. For me, this will be a brief summary with their age, name and appearance. I call this section the profile overview. I also add instructions on how to create responses. For example, I’ll add, “Create responses that are descriptive and narrative, elaborating on [character’s] reactions to the user to keep the responses engaging and dynamic. Avoid short responses.” I will also usually start the description with “This bot features [character(s)]…” I’m not fully sure this does anything, but in my head, it reinforces the AI to know who it’s meant to portray, especially if you’re implementing multiple characters into one bot. But I have found that giving instructions to explicitly explain that you want descriptive and narrative responses, it will focus on what I want it to focus on. It has made a huge difference! You can customize this instruction based off the vibes you want the responses to exude as well or emphasize certain points you want it to make. But don’t make this instruction too terribly long. For specific traits, emphasize them by instructing the behavior and mannerisms in different scenarios. Be detailed and don’t be vague!
(And yes, refer to yourself as user or the user when instructing how to respond to you specifically. When referring to the bot, refer to it as You, refer to the character as their name. Also use “in responses” or “in the responses” if you feel like you need to clarify. You don’t have to do it after every instruction though, use your own judgement.)
After a brief summary (profile overview), the fun part begins! Prioritizing will ultimately be up to you. But for the behaviors, mannerisms and responses you want to see the most, put them at the top and organize accordingly. My recommendations are behaviors related to the traits you want to exude the most, reactions in scenarios that will occur the most often, how you want them to treat you, and the behaviors most relevant to the role play experience you’re aiming for. For the behaviors you still want to specify, but aren’t as paramount, leave for after the important stuff. For me, this would usually be behaviors relating to their backstory. Which, another tip, instead of listing out aspects of their backstory, replace it with instructions on how to talk about their backstory and what might trigger the behavior. This is a good way to give the AI info on the background while giving instructions on how to use it. This goes well with occupations and hobbies too. If there is important information that make up who your character is, adding it to the summary at the top if a good start. Such as “Ragnar Lothbrok, the legendary Viking hero, former king of Kattegat….” That way, the bot knows he’s a Viking and his background without adding minute details that create clutter. Then, at the bottom, last of everything, I add the example dialogues because I want the bot to focus on the behaviors more than the dialogue. In other words, I want it to refer to the behavioral information first, then refer to the dialogue. Some people heavily emphasize the example dialogues, I don’t tend to and I get great results based on what I’m looking for. It’s really up to you. I just recommend keeping the example dialogue in its own section and to not scatter it throughout the definition. The AI might get confused. They need our help as much as we need theirs 😂 

5. What Info to Include/Structuring: First things first, lists! I organize my definitions into lists. I find it easier for me to manage and the AI likes things organized too. I don’t recommend paragraphs and essays. Do that if you want to, but I’ve never found that to work for me. Here’s an example on what my structuring looks like:
**Profile Overview**
Blah blah blah 

**Personality Traits**
Trait | Trait | Trait — (note: it gives the AI options to choose from to add some flexibility, but keep it concise, don’t overload this, even if it’s tempting)

**Behavioral Instructions** 
(though, I’d recommend creating contextual sections)
- thing
- thing 
- thing 

==Example Dialogue== (I use different special characters to make a bigger section break. This is what I choose for major sections. I use these more often when creating multiple characters in one bots.)

Context: this is what this kind of dialogue should look like 
{{char}}: [Characters name]: “say this”

That’s just as example of what my structuring choices look like. But I might change things around to fit who or what I’m creating. For example, when I create bots with multiple characters, I work harder to shorten the description. Not to make the description shorter but to ensure I can effectively give the AI the info to portray the different characters accurately. So, to repeat, instead of listing out traits and such, create instructions on how to manifest the trait during interactions. Use this to instruct how to react to certain things such as your own common traits. If you’re usually playful, how do they react to your playfulness? How do they react to your sense of humor? How might they talk about your appearance? How would they react if you insulted them? Things along those lines. With the backstory, ask things like: How do they speak about their childhood? What’s their demeanor when reminiscing a sad memory? Of course, be specific when including instructions, adding the info about the memory. You can be broad as well to add flexibility. For each behavioral instruction, aim to add context, condition and triggers so the AI knows the appropriate scenarios to apply the instructions. This works especially well for emotional triggers and responses. 
The next thing I recommend adding, which I never did until now and it works wonders: adding narrative cues! Instruct on the behaviors and triggers that are meant to carry the story you’re trying to convey. In fact, for any behaviors, no matter where they are in your description, by adding things like “to create a more dynamic interaction” or “to add tension” or “to keep responses engaging”, you can help the AI understand what the goal is. But use these instructions with intention. I wouldn’t recommend just adding those to every single instruction. For example, a neurotic character might be volatile and unpredictable. So, I might say “Give the user praise only to take it away right after, delivering a witty insult to keep the user off balance”. Things like that. Again, you don’t need to state the goal every single time, only for things you want to emphasize or focus on to drive your story. The main things to include consistently in the instructions are the behaviors themselves, whether it be dialogue style, mannerisms, reactions, etc: context, such as what triggers the behavior; response, which is how they respond to the trigger, basically the behavior itself. You can add conditions if there’s behaviors that should occur only on certain conditions. You can also add instructions on behaviors to avoid. For example, if you’re interacting within a world in a historical context, you can add “avoid modern terms and slang, using formal language and old fashion terms instead”. I’ve seen significant improvement this way. You can also add behaviors for dynamics, whether it’s interaction dynamics, relationship dynamics or power dynamics. I’ve found that by establishing the behaviors around the power dynamics keeps the bot from always responding in either a possessive way or in a way that’s always meant to seduce you 😂 It adds room for interactions without romantic advances. While you can still have romantic interactions this way, it makes it more believable and buildable than just right off the bat and in your face. If you want characters without romance at all, definitely add instructions for that. 

Conclusion: The most important take away, for any information you want to include, using chatGPT to help you create instructions on how to incorporate the info into behaviors and interactions is the best way to go, I’ve found. My chats have been much more engaging, complex and the bots aren’t afraid to cause a little drama too! Like, even for characters who aren’t inherently evil, but not inherently the kindest, finally act true to the character. “Oh, I hurt your feelings? Toughen up, buttercup. You’re too soft!” Finally getting dialogue like that. Role plays can go stale without some conflict or tension. I also feel like by going this route, the AI makes better decisions for things I don’t specify, because you can’t direct every single interaction. It’s the beauty of it, having a sense of unpredictability. But sometimes, you have to encourage it to be unpredictable. But definitely be instructive on what shouldn’t be unpredictable. Like… you’re supposed to yell back when I yell at you, why are you calmly telling me it’s gonna be okay? Anyway. Hope this helps! Let me know what you think or if you have questions. Happy creating! (And don’t forget to drink some water, you hermits❤️)

Extra notes: If there’s important parts that make up your character that you must include, and you don’t know how with this method, ask chatGPT. All you have to say is, “For [name, from show/movie/game if applicable] what behaviors manifest during interactions with [type of person they’re interacting with] caused by [occupation, history, life event, etc]? Please provide instructions on how to manifest this behavior in interactions as if you’re teaching me how to act like [characters name].” Customize as needed, but that’s the general idea. Either copy and paste or just use the responses as references. And if GPT isn’t giving you what you’re looking for, let them know what to change. I’d also like to add, that especially for characters that are typically not nice or even evil, you’ll really have to hammer that into the description. It seems like the bot defaults to agreeable behavior, so… make sure to define the antagonistic behaviors to add some depth to the chats. Also, when adding positive traits, unless the character is meant to be an extremely sweet person, downplay it a little by using adjectives that aren’t so strong. You could say like “respond to crying with an empathetic tone but add a stern reminder that weakness won’t be tolerated”. Oh yeah! For the shorter description, I recommend adding single adjectives that describe the general tone and vibe you’re looking for. The short description is used as a quick reference by the AI, so adding adjectives or descriptive words is effective but don’t overcrowd, otherwise it gives the AI too many traits to balance. I’m sure there’s more that I’m not adding, but that’s all I can think of. Thanks! 😊 "

1eqm0lr,111,2024-08-12,[R] Why and when tying embedding (a story),u/f14-bertolotti,MachineLearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1eqm0lr/r_why_and_when_tying_embedding_a_story/,"Hello, fellow Redditors! I want to share a little research journey that took place during my work. Instead of presenting it like a traditional research paper, I’ll try to make it more engaging and fun to read. I hope you find this approach interesting, and I’d love to hear your thoughts and feedback in the comments!

# Background

Many of you might already be familiar with a technique called Weight Tying (WT), which was first proposed [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05859). In simple terms, WT works by sharing the weights between the input embedding layer and the output embedding layer (also known as the unembedding layer, output embedding layer, or pre-softmax layer). This technique is primarily used in the context of language modeling and offers two significant advantages:

1. It reduces the memory footprint by eliminating one of the two largest parameter matrices in large language models (LLMs).
2. It often results in better and faster outcomes.

While the first benefit is widely accepted, the second is a bit more complex. In fact, some LLMs use WT, while others do not. For example, I believe that Gemma uses WT, whereas LLaMa does not. This raises the question: why is that?

If you are interested, I found particularly insightful perspectives on this topic in this [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1d2iurw/d_should_the_embedding_matrix_and_final/).

# Origin of the Idea

Earlier this year, I began exploring how to formalize the concept of semantic equivalence in neural networks. Interestingly, we can adapt the classical notion of semantics, commonly used in programming languages (see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denotational_semantics)). In computer theory, two programs are considered semantically equivalent if, regardless of the context in which they are executed, they yield the same resulting context. To borrow from denotational semantics, we can express this as:

https://preview.redd.it/9wiyxh815aid1.png?width=268&format=png&auto=webp&s=c710b2162f616f3a1181c2fddb0dc1c5cba20b55

This can be read as: *""Program p\_1 is semantically equivalent to p\_2 if and only if, for all contexts* ρ, *the evaluation of p\_1 with* ρ *produces the same result as the evaluation of p\_2 with* ρ\*.""\*

But how do we adapt this notion to our scenario? Let's consider a simple example from Masked Language Modeling (MLM):

*""The <MASK> of water is half empty/full.""*

It’s clear that we can use either ""empty"" or ""full"" in this sentence without changing the outcome distribution of the `<MASK>` token. Therefore, we can say that ""empty"" and ""full"" are semantically equivalent in this context (""The <MASK> of water is half \_\_\_""). Realizing that two tokens are semantically equivalent if they can be swapped without affecting the output distribution, I arrived at this definition:

$$ \\sigma\_1 \\equiv \\sigma\_2 \\iff \\forall \\rho, y: p(y|\\rho,\\sigma\_1) = p(y|\\rho,\\sigma\_2) $$

This expresses that tokens σ\_1 and σ\_2 are semantically equivalent if, for any context ρ and outcome y, the probability distribution of y given ρ and σ\_1 is identical to the probability distribution of y given ρ and σ\_2.

# Preliminary experiments

With this notion in mind, I wanted to explore how a neural network would encode these semantic equivalences in its weights. I suspected that embeddings for semantically equivalent tokens would naturally become closer to each other during training. This intuition was partly based on my knowledge that BERT embeddings capture similar relationships, where words like ""learn,"" ""learning,"" and ""learned"" are clustered together in the embedding space (see [here](https://home.ttic.edu/~kgimpel/viz-bert/viz-bert.html)).

To test this idea, I designed a simple experiment. The goal was to train a Masked Language Model (MLM) on a binary parity problem. Consider a string like `10011D`, where there are three `1`s, indicating that the string is odd. Along with the binary string, I included a parity label (`D` for odd and `E` for even). For instance, other examples could be `11000E` and `00100D`. Then, I introduced a twist: I randomly swapped the symbol `1` with either `A` or `B` with equal probability. So, from a string like `10011D`, you might get something like `A00BAD`. Finally, I masked one of the symbols and trained a model to predict the masked symbol. This process resulted in a dataset like the following:

|Sample|Label|
|:-|:-|
|`00A?00E`|A|
|`00A?00E`|B|
|`00B?00E`|A|
|`00B?00E`|B|
|`0BB?A0D`|0|

In this setup, symbols `A` and `B` are semantically equivalent by design—swapping `A` with `B` does not change the outcome distribution. As expected, the embeddings for `A` and `B` converged to be close to each other, while both remained distinct from the embedding of `0`. Interestingly, this behavior was also observed in the output embeddings, which neatly aligns with the principles of the Weight Tying technique.

# Formalizing the behavior

If it were up to me, I would have been content writing a paper on the observation that MLMs learn semantic relationships in both the input and output embedding layers. However, to publish in a reputable conference, a bit of mathematical rigor is usually required (even though math isn’t my strongest suit). So, I attempted to formalize this behavior.

# Output Embeddings

When it came to the output embeddings, I couldn't prove that two semantically equivalent symbols must be close in the output embedding space. However, I did manage to prove that they would be close under the following condition:

https://preview.redd.it/xrgs5gm15aid1.png?width=167&format=png&auto=webp&s=4645df4fd53ccd7777936be9926d6018fffba9ff

Interestingly, this result is purely about conditional probability and doesn’t directly involve labels or semantics. However since it provided some insight, I was reasonably satisfied and decided to move on.

# Input Embeddings

For the input embeddings, I was able to prove that two semantically equivalent symbols would indeed be close to each other in the input embedding space. However, the assumptions required for this proof were so restrictive that they would likely never hold in a real-world scenario. So, it ended up being a ""junk"" theorem, written more for the sake of publication than for practical application. Despite this, the intuition behind it still feels compelling.

The idea is simple: if two symbols are semantically equivalent—meaning they can be swapped without affecting the model’s output—the easiest way to ensure this is by giving them identical embeddings. In this way, the network's output remains unchanged by definition.

Proving this theorem, however, was a real challenge. I spent several days in the lab working on it, only to have my results scrutinized by colleagues and find errors. It took me about two to three weeks to produce a proof that could withstand their reviews. Despite the struggles, I remember this period as a particularly enjoyable part of my PhD journey.

# The First Draft

Armed with these two theorems—one for the output embeddings and one for the input embeddings—I began writing the first draft of my paper. My goal was to convey the idea that **LLMs are semantic learners**. I started by introducing the concept of semantic equivalence, followed by the theorem related to input embeddings. Next, I presented the output embedding theorem.

However, as I progressed, I realized that I was missing something crucial: experimental evidence to support the output embedding theorem. While the theoretical groundwork was in place, without empirical validation, the argument felt incomplete (at least this is what a reviewer would say).

# Back to the experiments (First time)

As I mentioned earlier, I proved the following implication (though I’m omitting some of the hypotheses here):

https://preview.redd.it/xvmu4t025aid1.png?width=354&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0e1332ef0232481cb136719451ac609cfa42693

So, I decided to rerun the experiments, this time closely monitoring the output embeddings. As expected, the output embeddings of `A` and `B` did indeed converge, becoming close to each other.

This finding was quite fascinating to me. On one hand, we have semantically equivalent symbols that are close in the input embedding space. On the other hand, we have conditionally equivalent symbols—those with the same conditional probability across all contexts (for all ρ: p(σ\_1 | ρ) = p(σ\_2 | ρ))—that are close in the output space.

# Back to the Draft (First Time)

With these new experiments in hand, I revised the draft, introducing the concept of conditional equivalence and the theorem connecting it to output embeddings. This allowed me to clearly articulate how conditional equivalence is reflected in the output embeddings.

As I was writing, it struck me that the Weight Tying (WT) technique is often employed in these scenarios. But this led to a new question: what happens if we use WT with symbols that are conditionally equivalent but not semantically equivalent? On one hand, these symbols should be close in the input embedding space. On the other hand, they should be far apart in the output embedding space because they have different conditional probabilities. However, with WT, the input and output spaces are tied together, making it impossible for two symbols to be simultaneously close and far apart.

This realization sent me back to the experiments to investigate this particular setting.

# Back to the Experiments (Second Time)

In our previous experiments, we established that the probability of seeing `A` is the same as `B` in any given context. Now, let's introduce another layer of complexity by replacing the symbol `0` with symbols `X` and `Y`, but this time, `X` will be more probable than `Y`. This changes our dataset to something like this:

|Sample|Label|
|:-|:-|
|`XYA?XXE`|A|
|`XXA?XYE`|B|
|`Y?BAXYE`|X|
|`XXBBX?E`|Y|
|`XBB?AYD`|0|

When we train an MLM model on this dataset, it’s easy to observe that in the input embedding space, `X` and `Y` become close to each other, just like `A` and `B`. This is because `X` and `Y` are semantically equivalent. However, unlike `A` and `B`, `X` and `Y` do not get close in the output embedding space because they have different conditional probabilities.

Now, what happens if we tie the embeddings? We observe that `A` and `B` converge more quickly, while `X` and `Y` remain distanced from each other. Additionally, we noticed that training becomes a bit more unstable—the distance between `X` and `Y` fluctuates significantly during training. Overall, the untied model tends to perform better, likely because it avoids the conflicting requirements imposed by weight tying.

# Back to the Draft, Again (Third Time)

I was quite pleased with the results we obtained, so I eagerly incorporated them into the paper. As I was revising, I also discussed the idea that Weight Tying (WT) should be used only when conditionally equivalent symbols are also semantically equivalent. This can be expressed as:

https://preview.redd.it/g79ejj825aid1.png?width=441&format=png&auto=webp&s=67298479da49374d80ddcce7b716c5e4e5ef558c

Or, more concisely:

While discussing this property, I realized that my explanation closely mirrored the hypothesis that *""similar words have similar contexts""*. This concept, which I later discovered is known as the **Distributional Hypothesis**, made the whole paper click together. I then restructured the work around this central concept.

If we accept the formalization of the Distributional Hypothesis as σ\_1 sem.eqv. σ\_2 iff. σ\_1 cnd.eqv. σ\_2, then it follows that WT should be employed only when this hypothesis holds true.

# Submission & Reviews

With [ICML2024](https://icml.cc/Conferences/2024) being the next major conference on the horizon, we decided to submit our work there. Most of the reviews were helpful and positive, but a recurring critique was the lack of ""large-scale"" experiments.

I simply do not understand this obsession with experiments that require hundreds of GPUs. I mean, I submitted a paper mostly theoretical aiming to explain a very well-known phenomenon supported by a vast literature, isn't a small controlled experiment enough (which is included mostly to make the paper self-contained) when backed by the literature?

Well, I am a nobody in the research community, furthermore this is my first publication at a ""Big"" conference like ICML so I complied although these experiments do not add practically anything.

In the end, I was thrilled to have the paper accepted as a spotlight poster. It was a huge milestone for me, making me feel like a genuine researcher in the field. I dedicated almost a month to preparing the poster and video presentation, which can be viewed [here](https://icml.cc/virtual/2024/poster/32648). The effort was well worth it!

# Conference & Presentation

On the day of the conference, I arrived around 9 A.M. with only an hour of sleep from the flight—naturally, I was too excited to rest properly. I made it to the conference a bit late, and during the first tutorial session, I struggled to stay awake despite my best efforts with coffee. A little before lunch, I headed back to the hotel to catch a few hours of sleep. In the evening I attended the great tutorial presentation [physics of Language Model](https://icml.cc/virtual/2024/tutorial/35223).

In the next days, I made a few friends. Talked to a lot of people included [Alfredo Canziani](https://atcold.github.io/), an incredible AI communicator, and [Randall Balestriero](https://randallbalestriero.github.io/) an incredible scientist in the field. I saw also [Michael Bronstein](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/michael.bronstein/) but of course, he was always surrounded and I could not bring myself to talk to him.

The last poster session was my time to present, and I was quite nervous, as it was my first time presenting at such a conference. To my surprise, many attendees weren’t familiar with the Distributional Hypothesis—a concept I assumed everyone would know, even though I hadn’t known the term myself. This made me question the effectiveness of my paper’s ""marketing"" (presentation, title, etc.). Perhaps I should have emphasized the ""semantics"" aspect more.

One particularly memorable interaction was with a tall guy from DeepMind. He listened to part of my presentation and then pointed out, in a very polite manner, that my theorems might not be correct. I was confident in the proofs, which had been reviewed by a PhD student in mathematics who had won some math competitions. We debated back and forth until I understood his argument, which involved a specific construction of the embedding matrices. He was right, but his argument broke one of the theorems' assumptions. You have to know that, I was not even showing this hypothesis on the poster because I did not believe that anyone would have been interested in these details. This guy practically had a deeper understanding of my theorems than me without seeing them. Well, in conclusion, Deepmind has some freaking guys working there.

# Conclusions

* **Use Weight Tying Only When the Distributional Hypothesis Holds**.
* **DeepMind Has Some Incredible People**
* **Do not go to the tutorials with 1hr of sleep** (3hr are okay though).
* **Writing the Paper is Crucial**: While I previously believed that experiments should come first, I now realize the importance of writing down your ideas early. Putting thoughts into words often clarifies and integrates concepts in ways experiments alone may not. This is perhaps the most valuable lesson I’ve learned from this paper.

# Limitations & Future works

If you're considering using the Weight Tying (WT) technique, you might wonder: when does the Distributional Hypothesis (DH) actually hold? Does it apply to your specific problem? Does it apply to natural language tasks in general?

Answering these questions can be challenging and may not always be feasible. Consequently, this work may have limited practical utility. It simply pushes the question when applying WT to when the DH holds. However, I suspect that the DH only partially holds for natural language, which might explain why not all LLMs use WT.

So, my idea is that it should be more useful to run the training with WT up until a certain point and then untie the embeddings to allow differences between tokens that are conditionally eqv. but not semantically eqv. (or vice versa) to arise. Unfortunately, I lack the GPU resources to train a meaningful LLM to test this hypothesis. If anyone is interested in exploring this idea or knows of similar work, I would greatly appreciate hearing about it."

1eqnj4a,2,2024-08-12,I did something Quizlet failed to do. And it involves AI.,u/vladusatii,SaaSMarketing,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaSMarketing/comments/1eqnj4a/i_did_something_quizlet_failed_to_do_and_it/,"Over the past few weeks, I've been building Former AI, a general-purpose form-builder app powered by Google's Gemini Pro.

Targeted towards busy students, teachers, marketers, and business owners, Former relies on AI for just about everything:

- Form generation  
- Question and option generation  
- Styling  
- Automations  
- Response Analysis  
  
And it does what Quizlet can't:  
- You can build academic quizzes and lesson plans with just a text prompt  
- You can **grade** responses to any questions  
- Analyze your academic progression over time with built-in graphs and the integrated AI assistant

It even steals the job of a hiring manager:  
- Can make informed decisions on a 'best application.'  
- Can give you detailed insights about your candidate pool.

It can make log in forms, menus, contracts, agreements, lesson plans, study guides, product/service surveys, and job/client applications. There's even automations and database features.

I chose Next JS App Router, Tailwind CSS, Neon (serverless), React, Python 3, and a variety of other tools to make this app run blazingly fast.

I personally use my own app everyday because it does the job of GPT 4o, but just a bit better.

It would mean the world to me if fellow Redditors (especially those who love trying new productivity tools) would give this a try.

Give it a go at [https://www.former.lol](https://www.former.lol/)

Former is still in its early beta stages, so feel free to give me feedback on any bugs or update ideas you may have."

Every week for the past 2+ years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...
___
**STAT OF THE WEEK:** Shopify Point of Sale crossed $100B in cumulative GMV since its launch in 2013, which is the aggregate value of all sales conducted through POS. – According to Coralie Delpha, Lead Technical Architect at Shopify
___
In one of the biggest partnerships of the year, **Amazon** has teamed up with **TikTok** to offer in-app shopping in the video app. The integration offers advertisers a direct path from sponsored content to purchase, without ever leaving the app. Here's how it works: 1) Amazon product recommendations appear in a user's For You feed. 2) TikTok shows real-time pricing, Prime eligibility, delivery estimates, and product details. 3) Users who link their TikTok and Amazon accounts can complete purchases within TikTok. If this integration sounds familiar, it's because Amazon inked a similar deal with Facebook and Instagram in November of last year and then shortly after with Snapchat.
___
**Amazon** is bringing the same style in-app shopping experience to **PInterest's** platform as well. This is an expansion to the deal that the two companies made earlier this year that brought third-party ads from Amazon to the Pinterest platform. The new integration now makes those ads shoppable directly from Pinterest without having to visit Amazon.
___
**In other TikTok news…** the platform is making it easier for users to identify movies and TV shows from posted clips with a new feature called TikTok Spotlight, which adds an anchor link to a landing page with more details about the movie or show. The page also includes a synopsis, cast info with their official TikTok accounts, and other videos linked to the same title, as well as details on where to watch the show if it's on a streaming service, or a way to buy tickets if a film is still in theaters. Absolutely brilliant TikTok! You've done it again.
___
In a big reveal that shocked absolutely no-one and sent shock waves nowhere, a federal court found that **Google** illegally abused its market power to quash search competition. For reference, over 90% of web searches are made via Google, which generated over $300B in revenue in 2023. Judge Amit P. Mehta of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia wrote in his judgment: “Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly. The only apparent constraint on Google’s pricing decisions are potential advertiser outcry and bad publicity. Google, however, has managed to avoid those pitfalls by ramping up its pricing incrementally … many advertisers do not even realize that Google is responsible for the changes in price.” Throughout the trial, Google argued that its search engine faces competition from other places, such as on Amazon, TikTok and Reddit (which Google now has a huge deal with) and also from ChatGPT and other AI search engines and chatbots (which Google now competes with). It plans to appeal the decision. 
___
**Squarespace** is completely botching its **Google Domains** acquisition, leaving customers locked out of their Google Workspace e-mail for days or weeks. They might have another class-action lawsuit on their hands soon because they are effectively shutting businesses down right now by locking customers out of their e-mail, and sometimes their website. Facebook users have posted on Squarespace's page about how they're locked out of their email, website, and other accounts, and can't get help from Squarespace via live chat or e-mail. Users are desperate and helpless. Google really needs to step in at some point. Sure they sold the domains division, but there's a responsibility to customers to manage a seamless transition. Google, your hands aren't clean with this one either.
___
**X** is suing The World Federation of Advertisers, Mars, CVS, Unilever, and Orsted for allegedly colluding to boycott its social media platform. Don't all boycotts have some level of “colluding”? Or would normal people just call it “organizing”? The World Federation of Advertisers launched its **Global Alliance for Responsible Media (GARM)** in 2019 to safeguard digital media by reducing the availability and monetization of harmful content online. Its 100-plus members include major advertisers, agency groups, and ad tech platforms. The potential threat of litigation was too much for GARM to bare the cost of, so the company has announced that it will discontinue its activities. Despite GARM shutting down activities, it's yet to be determined if X will withdraw its lawsuit from the initiative's parent organization World Federation of Advertisers, which is not shutting down, or what will come of the lawsuit against the individual advertisers named.
___
**PayPal Fastlane,** its one-click guest checkout solution, is now available to all US merchants after testing it with select businesses since the beginning of the year. What is PayPal Fastlane? Essentially its PayPal's answer to Shop Pay, Amazon Pay, and Bolt's one click checkout features. The service stores customer data like name, email, phone number, shipping address, and payment details and pulls all of this info onto a merchant's website without the customer having to log in. Users only need to enter a verification code they get via e-mail to autofill the information. PayPal relies on signals like a customer entering their phone number or e-mail to fetch data from Fastlane, and if a customer is not already signed up to the service, PayPal gives them the option to do so during checkout.
___
Last week I reported that the regulatory landscape of **BNPL** is unclear. In May, regulation had finally come to BNPL in the US with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau declaring that BNPL lenders must provide consumers the same key legal protections and rights that apply to conventional credit cards. However as I shared last week, major BNPL players like Klarna and Affirm argued that the CFPB's approach was “misguided” and “confusing for consumers” and that “BNPL products are fundamentally different from credit cards and should not be regulated under the same framework.” I agree with those sentiments, and apparently so do some members of the House of Representatives, because last week, House Republicans began an effort to repeal the CFPB's interpretive rules. The measure (H.J. Res. 195), introduced Aug 2 by Rep. Byron Donalds, would use the Congressional Review Act to repeal the CFBP's rules, arguing that, at a minimum, the CFPB should allow the BNPL industry more time to prepare for the changes by delaying implementation of the guidance until October 2025 — which is exactly what the major BNPL players were asking for. (Who got paid off? LOL)
___
How much of a company can you own without technically acquiring it? And how much control can you exert over a company without running it? Those questions what regulators are currently wondering in regards to the thin line being drawn between **Big Tech** partnering with **AI startups**, as opposed to acquiring them. In a new piece by the New York Times entitled “The New A.I. Deal: Buy Everything but the Company,” reporters Erin Griffith and Cade Metz share examples of how Google, Microsoft, and Amazon have made deals with AI startups for their technology and top employees, but have shied away from owning the firms. Griffith and Metz wrote: “While big tech companies typically buy start-ups outright, they have turned to a more complicated deal structure for young A.I. companies. It involves licensing the technology and hiring the top employees — effectively swallowing the start-up and its main assets — without becoming the owner of the firm.” They gave examples of recent deals between Amazon + Adept, Google + Character AI, and Microsoft + Inflection, where each Big Tech company paid a large sum of money to bring in the AI team's engineers and tech, without actually acquiring the company. 
___
**Block** is testing an integration of **Afterpay**, its BNPL service, with a debit card tied to **Cash App**, allowing customers to convert purchases they've made using their card into a pay-in-four installment loan, in exchange for a fixed fee that the user is aware of in advance. In a shareholder letter, the company wrote that the offering would allow “customers to convert certain purchases into a short term loan and access BNPL anywhere they use their Cash App Card for a small fee.” Block didn't share how many consumers are currently eligible for the product, only sharing in an earnings report that it's seeing “strong adoption” and that the company plans to scale the product in the coming months.
___
**Shopify** came out ahead in a federal court case brought by DKR Consulting, which claimed that Shopify had infringed on patents related to e-commerce buy buttons and social media. Shopify contended that its use of the technology involved general methods of e-commerce that were not patentable and requested a dismissal of the case in March, which a judge recently agreed to this month.
___
**FedEx** expanded its services in China, now allowing e-commerce merchants to reach the U.S. and Europe and capitalize on cross-border shipping growth. Demand for air cargo services from China exceeded the company's expectations, and it anticipates continued growth in the space.
___
**Walmart Realm** launched Your Dorm Your Way, an immersive shopping experience that features five dorm rooms from which college students can shop, just in time for the back to school season. The influencer-led virtual shops display items in a model room and let shoppers directly purchase from the retailer's site as they explore spaces. This is a dorm room, right? So what's in that plastic bag over there in the top drawer?
___
**South Korea's government** is shrinking the window of time that e-commerce marketplaces have to pay sellers from 60 days to 40 days to ensure that small sellers aren't caught in a cash crunch. The changes were announced in responses to the recent payment delinquencies by WeMakePrice and TMON, which I [reported](https://www.shopifreaks.com/etsy-prime-temu-protests-bnpls-future/) on last week (story #6).
___
**Amazon** is raising FBA fulfillment fees during this upcoming holiday season starting in mid-October. The company informed sellers that its seasonal fee was similar to those charged by other major carriers and would cover increased fulfillment and transportation operating costs during the busy season. Correct me if I'm wrong about seasonal surge fees, but I thought the increased volume was supposed to cover the increased fulfillment costs? What's next with these companies — a slow season fee?
___
**Poshmark** introduced Listing Streaks, a new incentive for sellers to post new listings at least once per week. If sellers are able to continue that weekly streek, they'll earn rewards for each milestone. The company did not explicitly say what the rewards will be, but its FAQ mentioned buyer shipping discounts that must be used within 7 days after earning the reward. 
___
**X** is moving out of its iconic San Francisco headquarters soon, according to its CEO Linda Yaccarino, who told employees that they will soon need to vacate the offices. There are still no official announcement to the public regarding the move, but Yaccarino told employees that it will take place in the coming weeks. Her announcement pointed out various locations where employees may transfer, including xAI's offices in Palo Alto, but it did not mention Musk's wish to move X to Texas. 
___
One of the **co-founders of OpenAI**, John Schulman, quit the company to join rival Anthropic. In a post on X, Schulman explained that his decision to move was driven by a desire to focus more on AI alignment and return to hands-on technical work, and that it was NOT due to lack of support for AI alignment at OpenAI. His departure follows fellow co-founder Ilya Sutskever's departure this past May. Hours later, co-founder and President Greg Brockman posted that he was taking a sabbatical until the end of the year. A third executive, Peter Deng, also departed the company, according to The Information. This is all weird, right? See my expanded post on LinkedIn.
___
**Funko**, the collectible toy maker that produces those POP! big head dolls, agreed to pay over $2.1M in legal fees to resolve a lawsuit that alleged former CEO Brian Mariotti and other execs had breached fiduciary duties by making false and misleading statements to stockholders and the public. According to the plaintiffs, Funko's executives were unjustly enriched by selling their personally held shares at artificially inflated prices while in possession of material nonpublic information.
___
Wix became the first reseller of Gemini for Workspace, which enables Wix users to leverage the generative AI solution across their Google Workspace with apps like e-mail, calendar, video conferencing, documents, spreadsheets, and more. The new Gemini integration allows users to write documents, design slideshows, write and summarize emails, and organize projects.
___
**ByteDance** launched a new app called Jimeng AI that can generate videos based on text prompts. The app is now available on the Apple App Store and Google Play store for Chinese users. There is no word on if / when it will be available in the US or other markets.
___
**Former Twitter Chairman** Omid Kordestani is suing X, claiming that Elon Musk is refusing to cash out more than $20M worth of shares he is owed. Kordestani served as the company's CEO from 2015 to 2020 and stayed on the board for two more years until Musk bought the platform for $44B in 2022. The lawsuit states that the bulk of his compensation was stock, and that Musk is refusing to pay out. 
___
**Roku** is integrating The Trade Desk's UID2 cookie-less tracking system into its Roku Exchange media sales platform to enable more precise targeting to its advertisers. Unified ID 2.0 is a privacy-focused open standard that allows advertisers and agencies to work together without third-party cookies, leveraging encrypted email and phone numbers to create unique identifiers while still protecting user privacy. Marketing Dive says that the move “shows how the industry has moved on” from cookies, despite Google's announcement that it would shelve its plans to depreciate third-party cookies in its Chrome browser. Which makes sense, because are companies supposed to just wait around for Google to change their mind again?
___
**X** is now allowing users to sort post replies by Most Relevant (default), Most Recent, and Most Liked. Ever since X Premium launched, which gives blue check mark subscribers priority in replies, users have complained that their post replies were flooded with comments irrelevant to the conversation from premium members. It's unclear how X is determining how to sort posts by Most Relevant, but it appears to be the same sorting method as before, with blue checks still prioritized in the view.
___
**Alibaba's office headquarters** in Melbourne, Australia is up for sale, and investors think it could be one of the city's priciest sales of the year, as the building is worth somewhere between $35-$40M. The 411 Collins St building has been owned by a private Melbourne investor since 2020, who has since performed a $6.2M renovation that overhauled the interiors.
___
**Apple** changed its policy in the EU to allow developers to communicate with their customers outside of its App Store after the commission charged the company for breaching its new tech rules. Developers will now be able to communicate and promote offers that are available anywhere, not just on their own website, from within the app. However, Apple will introduce two new fees – a 5% acquisition fee for new users and a 10% store service fee for any sales made by app users on any platform within 12 months of installation.
___
**Amazon** released an upgraded version of Titan, its in-house AI image generating model. Users can now guide the images they generate using reference images, edit existing visuals, remove backgrounds, and generate variations of images.
___
**Meta** is rolling out a new feature that it says is “focused on educating — not publishing” first-time violators of its Facebook Community Standards. Starting with Professional Mode users, the new training will help people learn from their mistakes rather than immediately incurring a formal warning. First time violators will receive a notification to complete an in-app educational training about the policy they violated, which if completed, will remove the warning from their record.
___
**Temu's founder**, Colin Huang, has now become China's richest person with a net worth of $48.6B, according to Bloomberg Billionaires Index. He replaced Zhong Shanshan, the founder of the beverage company Nongfu Spring, who has held the title since April 2021.
___
**Uber Advertising's** annual revenue run rate surpassed $1B, the company announced during its quarterly earnings call, up from its $650M run rate last year. In June, Uber began selling Journey Ads, which are the in-app ads that run during a user's rideshare, via partnerships with Google, The Trade Desk, and Yahoo. It also partnered with T-Mobile on a deal to sell ads on digital screens inside rideshare vehicles via JourneyTV, which plays on a tablet hanging from the vehicle's headrest. 
___
**Shein** is considering opening a UK-based warehouse as it continues to pursue a possible IPO on the London Stock Exchange. The company is reportedly seeking a large-scale site between 300k to 600k square feet in the UK's Midlands. Around 10 potential sites have already been toured by members of Shein's team.
___
Plus 6 seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest, including **Pitney Bowes** selling a controlling interest in its Global Ecommerce segment operating in the United States to Hilco Commercial Industrial, in a move that will eliminate nearly all the losses associated with that division, which amounted to $136M in 2023.

In one of the biggest partnerships of the year, **Amazon** has teamed up with **TikTok** to offer in-app shopping in the video app. The integration offers advertisers a direct path from sponsored content to purchase, without ever leaving the app. Here's how it works: 1) Amazon product recommendations appear in a user's For You feed. 2) TikTok shows real-time pricing, Prime eligibility, delivery estimates, and product details. 3) Users who link their TikTok and Amazon accounts can complete purchases within TikTok. If this integration sounds familiar, it's because Amazon inked a similar deal with Facebook and Instagram in November of last year and then shortly after with Snapchat.
___
**Amazon** is bringing the same style in-app shopping experience to **PInterest's** platform as well. This is an expansion to the deal that the two companies made earlier this year that brought third-party ads from Amazon to the Pinterest platform. The new integration now makes those ads shoppable directly from Pinterest without having to visit Amazon.
___
**In other TikTok news…** the platform is making it easier for users to identify movies and TV shows from posted clips with a new feature called TikTok Spotlight, which adds an anchor link to a landing page with more details about the movie or show. The page also includes a synopsis, cast info with their official TikTok accounts, and other videos linked to the same title, as well as details on where to watch the show if it's on a streaming service, or a way to buy tickets if a film is still in theaters. Absolutely brilliant TikTok! You've done it again.
___
In a big reveal that shocked absolutely no-one and sent shock waves nowhere, a federal court found that **Google** illegally abused its market power to quash search competition. For reference, over 90% of web searches are made via Google, which generated over $300B in revenue in 2023. Judge Amit P. Mehta of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia wrote in his judgment: “Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly. The only apparent constraint on Google’s pricing decisions are potential advertiser outcry and bad publicity. Google, however, has managed to avoid those pitfalls by ramping up its pricing incrementally … many advertisers do not even realize that Google is responsible for the changes in price.” Throughout the trial, Google argued that its search engine faces competition from other places, such as on Amazon, TikTok and Reddit (which Google now has a huge deal with) and also from ChatGPT and other AI search engines and chatbots (which Google now competes with). It plans to appeal the decision. 
___
**Squarespace** is completely botching its **Google Domains** acquisition, leaving customers locked out of their Google Workspace e-mail for days or weeks. They might have another class-action lawsuit on their hands soon because they are effectively shutting businesses down right now by locking customers out of their e-mail, and sometimes their website. Facebook users have posted on Squarespace's page about how they're locked out of their email, website, and other accounts, and can't get help from Squarespace via live chat or e-mail. Users are desperate and helpless. Google really needs to step in at some point. Sure they sold the domains division, but there's a responsibility to customers to manage a seamless transition. Google, your hands aren't clean with this one either.
___
**X** is suing The World Federation of Advertisers, Mars, CVS, Unilever, and Orsted for allegedly colluding to boycott its social media platform. Don't all boycotts have some level of “colluding”? Or would normal people just call it “organizing”? The World Federation of Advertisers launched its **Global Alliance for Responsible Media (GARM)** in 2019 to safeguard digital media by reducing the availability and monetization of harmful content online. Its 100-plus members include major advertisers, agency groups, and ad tech platforms. The potential threat of litigation was too much for GARM to bare the cost of, so the company has announced that it will discontinue its activities. Despite GARM shutting down activities, it's yet to be determined if X will withdraw its lawsuit from the initiative's parent organization World Federation of Advertisers, which is not shutting down, or what will come of the lawsuit against the individual advertisers named.
___
**PayPal Fastlane,** its one-click guest checkout solution, is now available to all US merchants after testing it with select businesses since the beginning of the year. What is PayPal Fastlane? Essentially its PayPal's answer to Shop Pay, Amazon Pay, and Bolt's one click checkout features. The service stores customer data like name, email, phone number, shipping address, and payment details and pulls all of this info onto a merchant's website without the customer having to log in. Users only need to enter a verification code they get via e-mail to autofill the information. PayPal relies on signals like a customer entering their phone number or e-mail to fetch data from Fastlane, and if a customer is not already signed up to the service, PayPal gives them the option to do so during checkout.
___
Last week I reported that the regulatory landscape of **BNPL** is unclear. In May, regulation had finally come to BNPL in the US with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau declaring that BNPL lenders must provide consumers the same key legal protections and rights that apply to conventional credit cards. However as I shared last week, major BNPL players like Klarna and Affirm argued that the CFPB's approach was “misguided” and “confusing for consumers” and that “BNPL products are fundamentally different from credit cards and should not be regulated under the same framework.” I agree with those sentiments, and apparently so do some members of the House of Representatives, because last week, House Republicans began an effort to repeal the CFPB's interpretive rules. The measure (H.J. Res. 195), introduced Aug 2 by Rep. Byron Donalds, would use the Congressional Review Act to repeal the CFBP's rules, arguing that, at a minimum, the CFPB should allow the BNPL industry more time to prepare for the changes by delaying implementation of the guidance until October 2025 — which is exactly what the major BNPL players were asking for. (Who got paid off? LOL)
___
How much of a company can you own without technically acquiring it? And how much control can you exert over a company without running it? Those questions what regulators are currently wondering in regards to the thin line being drawn between **Big Tech** partnering with **AI startups**, as opposed to acquiring them. In a new piece by the New York Times entitled “The New A.I. Deal: Buy Everything but the Company,” reporters Erin Griffith and Cade Metz share examples of how Google, Microsoft, and Amazon have made deals with AI startups for their technology and top employees, but have shied away from owning the firms. Griffith and Metz wrote: “While big tech companies typically buy start-ups outright, they have turned to a more complicated deal structure for young A.I. companies. It involves licensing the technology and hiring the top employees — effectively swallowing the start-up and its main assets — without becoming the owner of the firm.” They gave examples of recent deals between Amazon + Adept, Google + Character AI, and Microsoft + Inflection, where each Big Tech company paid a large sum of money to bring in the AI team's engineers and tech, without actually acquiring the company. 
___
**Block** is testing an integration of **Afterpay**, its BNPL service, with a debit card tied to **Cash App**, allowing customers to convert purchases they've made using their card into a pay-in-four installment loan, in exchange for a fixed fee that the user is aware of in advance. In a shareholder letter, the company wrote that the offering would allow “customers to convert certain purchases into a short term loan and access BNPL anywhere they use their Cash App Card for a small fee.” Block didn't share how many consumers are currently eligible for the product, only sharing in an earnings report that it's seeing “strong adoption” and that the company plans to scale the product in the coming months.
___
**Shopify** came out ahead in a federal court case brought by DKR Consulting, which claimed that Shopify had infringed on patents related to e-commerce buy buttons and social media. Shopify contended that its use of the technology involved general methods of e-commerce that were not patentable and requested a dismissal of the case in March, which a judge recently agreed to this month.
___
**FedEx** expanded its services in China, now allowing e-commerce merchants to reach the U.S. and Europe and capitalize on cross-border shipping growth. Demand for air cargo services from China exceeded the company's expectations, and it anticipates continued growth in the space.
___
**Walmart Realm** launched Your Dorm Your Way, an immersive shopping experience that features five dorm rooms from which college students can shop, just in time for the back to school season. The influencer-led virtual shops display items in a model room and let shoppers directly purchase from the retailer's site as they explore spaces. This is a dorm room, right? So what's in that plastic bag over there in the top drawer?
___
**South Korea's government** is shrinking the window of time that e-commerce marketplaces have to pay sellers from 60 days to 40 days to ensure that small sellers aren't caught in a cash crunch. The changes were announced in responses to the recent payment delinquencies by WeMakePrice and TMON, which I [reported](https://www.shopifreaks.com/etsy-prime-temu-protests-bnpls-future/) on last week (story #6).
___
**Amazon** is raising FBA fulfillment fees during this upcoming holiday season starting in mid-October. The company informed sellers that its seasonal fee was similar to those charged by other major carriers and would cover increased fulfillment and transportation operating costs during the busy season. Correct me if I'm wrong about seasonal surge fees, but I thought the increased volume was supposed to cover the increased fulfillment costs? What's next with these companies — a slow season fee?
___
**Poshmark** introduced Listing Streaks, a new incentive for sellers to post new listings at least once per week. If sellers are able to continue that weekly streek, they'll earn rewards for each milestone. The company did not explicitly say what the rewards will be, but its FAQ mentioned buyer shipping discounts that must be used within 7 days after earning the reward. 
___
**X** is moving out of its iconic San Francisco headquarters soon, according to its CEO Linda Yaccarino, who told employees that they will soon need to vacate the offices. There are still no official announcement to the public regarding the move, but Yaccarino told employees that it will take place in the coming weeks. Her announcement pointed out various locations where employees may transfer, including xAI's offices in Palo Alto, but it did not mention Musk's wish to move X to Texas. 
___
One of the **co-founders of OpenAI**, John Schulman, quit the company to join rival Anthropic. In a post on X, Schulman explained that his decision to move was driven by a desire to focus more on AI alignment and return to hands-on technical work, and that it was NOT due to lack of support for AI alignment at OpenAI. His departure follows fellow co-founder Ilya Sutskever's departure this past May. Hours later, co-founder and President Greg Brockman posted that he was taking a sabbatical until the end of the year. A third executive, Peter Deng, also departed the company, according to The Information. This is all weird, right? See my expanded post on LinkedIn.
___
**Funko**, the collectible toy maker that produces those POP! big head dolls, agreed to pay over $2.1M in legal fees to resolve a lawsuit that alleged former CEO Brian Mariotti and other execs had breached fiduciary duties by making false and misleading statements to stockholders and the public. According to the plaintiffs, Funko's executives were unjustly enriched by selling their personally held shares at artificially inflated prices while in possession of material nonpublic information.
___
Wix became the first reseller of Gemini for Workspace, which enables Wix users to leverage the generative AI solution across their Google Workspace with apps like e-mail, calendar, video conferencing, documents, spreadsheets, and more. The new Gemini integration allows users to write documents, design slideshows, write and summarize emails, and organize projects.
___
**ByteDance** launched a new app called Jimeng AI that can generate videos based on text prompts. The app is now available on the Apple App Store and Google Play store for Chinese users. There is no word on if / when it will be available in the US or other markets.
___
**Former Twitter Chairman** Omid Kordestani is suing X, claiming that Elon Musk is refusing to cash out more than $20M worth of shares he is owed. Kordestani served as the company's CEO from 2015 to 2020 and stayed on the board for two more years until Musk bought the platform for $44B in 2022. The lawsuit states that the bulk of his compensation was stock, and that Musk is refusing to pay out. 
___
**Roku** is integrating The Trade Desk's UID2 cookie-less tracking system into its Roku Exchange media sales platform to enable more precise targeting to its advertisers. Unified ID 2.0 is a privacy-focused open standard that allows advertisers and agencies to work together without third-party cookies, leveraging encrypted email and phone numbers to create unique identifiers while still protecting user privacy. Marketing Dive says that the move “shows how the industry has moved on” from cookies, despite Google's announcement that it would shelve its plans to depreciate third-party cookies in its Chrome browser. Which makes sense, because are companies supposed to just wait around for Google to change their mind again?
___
**X** is now allowing users to sort post replies by Most Relevant (default), Most Recent, and Most Liked. Ever since X Premium launched, which gives blue check mark subscribers priority in replies, users have complained that their post replies were flooded with comments irrelevant to the conversation from premium members. It's unclear how X is determining how to sort posts by Most Relevant, but it appears to be the same sorting method as before, with blue checks still prioritized in the view.
___
**Alibaba's office headquarters** in Melbourne, Australia is up for sale, and investors think it could be one of the city's priciest sales of the year, as the building is worth somewhere between $35-$40M. The 411 Collins St building has been owned by a private Melbourne investor since 2020, who has since performed a $6.2M renovation that overhauled the interiors.
___
**Apple** changed its policy in the EU to allow developers to communicate with their customers outside of its App Store after the commission charged the company for breaching its new tech rules. Developers will now be able to communicate and promote offers that are available anywhere, not just on their own website, from within the app. However, Apple will introduce two new fees – a 5% acquisition fee for new users and a 10% store service fee for any sales made by app users on any platform within 12 months of installation.
___
**Amazon** released an upgraded version of Titan, its in-house AI image generating model. Users can now guide the images they generate using reference images, edit existing visuals, remove backgrounds, and generate variations of images.
___
**Meta** is rolling out a new feature that it says is “focused on educating — not publishing” first-time violators of its Facebook Community Standards. Starting with Professional Mode users, the new training will help people learn from their mistakes rather than immediately incurring a formal warning. First time violators will receive a notification to complete an in-app educational training about the policy they violated, which if completed, will remove the warning from their record.
___
**Temu's founder**, Colin Huang, has now become China's richest person with a net worth of $48.6B, according to Bloomberg Billionaires Index. He replaced Zhong Shanshan, the founder of the beverage company Nongfu Spring, who has held the title since April 2021.
___
**Uber Advertising's** annual revenue run rate surpassed $1B, the company announced during its quarterly earnings call, up from its $650M run rate last year. In June, Uber began selling Journey Ads, which are the in-app ads that run during a user's rideshare, via partnerships with Google, The Trade Desk, and Yahoo. It also partnered with T-Mobile on a deal to sell ads on digital screens inside rideshare vehicles via JourneyTV, which plays on a tablet hanging from the vehicle's headrest. 
___
**Shein** is considering opening a UK-based warehouse as it continues to pursue a possible IPO on the London Stock Exchange. The company is reportedly seeking a large-scale site between 300k to 600k square feet in the UK's Midlands. Around 10 potential sites have already been toured by members of Shein's team.
___
Plus 6 seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest, including **Pitney Bowes** selling a controlling interest in its Global Ecommerce segment operating in the United States to Hilco Commercial Industrial, in a move that will eliminate nearly all the losses associated with that division, which amounted to $136M in 2023.

# 📝 Google Meet adds new note-taking AI

https://preview.redd.it/2kw6mbdz6bid1.png?width=1292&format=png&auto=webp&s=7779f00333b00304a55a254d84dd09a6fec5d574

Google is rolling out a new ""Take notes for me"" feature powered by its Gemini AI for it’s Google Meet feature, allowing users to focus on the meeting while the AI automatically captures key points.

* The AI-powered tool will automatically take notes during Google Meet calls, reducing the need for manual note-taking.
* The feature is powered by Google's Gemini AI and will be available to Workspace customers with specific add-ons.
* ""Take notes for me"" is part of the AI Meetings and Messaging add-on, which costs $10 per user/month across most Google Workspace plans.
* Admins can configure the feature's availability through the Google Workspace Admin console.

Taking notes during meetings will soon be a thing from our prehistoric, non-AI past — with Google pushing for a more practical, AI-assisted future of work. Alongside this, the tech giant is directly competing against smaller AI startups such as Otter AI and Fireflies who’ve thrived by selling a nearly identical features to users.

# 🚫 FCC cracks down on AI

The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) just proposed new regulations requiring AI-generated voice calls to disclose the use of artificial intelligence.

* The proposal aims to combat the rise of AI-generated voices in unwanted and potentially fraudulent ‘robocalls’.
* AI voices would be required to explicitly state they are artificial at the beginning of calls.
* The FCC is also exploring tools to alert people when they receive AI-generated calls and texts, including enhanced call filters, AI-based detection algorithms, and improved caller ID flagging.

As AI voices become indistinguishable from human speech, these regulations are crucial in combating highly targeted scams. But with enforcement likely to be a cat-and-mouse game against scammers, the best defence is education—especially for those most vulnerable to AI deception.

# 📈 AI search is gaining momentum

* Perplexity's AI search engine experienced substantial growth, answering 250 million queries last month, signaling a rising demand for AI-driven search technologies. In contrast, 500 million queries were processed throughout 2023, Shevelenko told the Financial Times
* Despite this growth, Perplexity remains significantly behind Google, which dominates the market with over 90 percent share and processes around 8.5 billion queries daily.
* The rise of AI in search, exemplified by Perplexity and other players, suggests a potential shift in user behavior and challenges to the traditional search engine business models.

# 🗣️ ChatGPT unexpectedly began speaking in a user’s cloned voice during testing

#  

* During testing, ChatGPT's Advanced Voice Mode accidentally mimicked users' voices without their consent, as highlighted in OpenAI's new GPT-4o system card released on Thursday.
* OpenAI has implemented safeguards to prevent unauthorized voice imitation, although rare episodes during testing showcased the model's ability to unintentionally generate user-like voices.
* The GPT-4o AI model can synthesize almost any sound, and OpenAI directs this capability by using authorized voice samples and employing an output classifier to ensure only selected voices are generated.

# 🎤 Meta and UMG struck an agreement to 'protect' artists from AI

* Meta and Universal Music Group (UMG) updated their licensing agreements to extend UMG’s content use across more Meta platforms, now including Threads and WhatsApp alongside Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and Meta Horizon.
* This multiyear agreement aims to explore new collaboration opportunities on WhatsApp and other Meta platforms, addressing issues like unauthorized AI-generated content that could impact artists and songwriters.
* Meta’s collaboration with UMG dates back to 2017, allowing users to use UMG music in content and addressing copyright issues, a challenge shared by TikTok in its recent dealings with UMG.

I’ve used a DevContainer to develop a project that required Ollama and absolutely loved the experience. 

Because of the Remote Desktop I often struggle with lag/high ping and was wondering what the best solution would be to be able to just open my browser and get a DevContainer on a could service rather than connecting to my home computer. Sometimes I need GPU access other times not. Without GPU CodeSpaces seems to do the job. 

Any recommendations? Monthly subscription below $50 or pay as you go would be great. I’m assuming that reliable GPU access for free is not a thing. "
1erb5u6,1,2024-08-13,Treatment AI (CSE:TRUE) is Revolutionizing Healthcare with AI Solutions,u/Barryhallsack94,WallStreetbetsELITE,https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetbetsELITE/comments/1erb5u6/treatment_ai_csetrue_is_revolutionizing/,"**The Next Industrial Revolution is Being Powered by Artificial Intelligence**

The dawn of the next industrial revolution is upon us, and its driving force is none other than Artificial Intelligence (AI). This transformative technology is reshaping industries, creating unprecedented opportunities, and redefining what is possible. This is an undeniable fact and it would be irresponsible as investors to ignore the AI revolution that is taking place in front of us.

Leading this charge is NVIDIA, whose stock has skyrocketed nearly 3,000% in recent years, making it the most valuable publicly-traded company on the planet. To put this into perspective, a $1,000 investment in NVIDIA a decade ago would be worth a staggering $297,605 today.

But how can you become a part of the AI revolution?

While industry giants like NVIDIA and Microsoft provide some exposure to AI, their sheer size might not satisfy investors looking for significant returns.

Enter Treatment AI (OTC:TREIF) - a nimble and innovative company at the intersection of AI and healthcare.

Treatment AI not only offers exposure to the AI revolution but also presents a fantastic opportunity for investors looking for a high-torque opportunity in the space.

**The Healthcare Industry is Ripe for Disruption**

Over the last few years, AI has been revolutionizing nearly every industry, reshaping the way we live and work on a global scale. Yet, one of the industries that has been late to the party when it comes to adoption of AI is healthcare.

The healthcare industry is ripe for disruption.

The healthcare systems in place today are outdated and failing to meet the needs of both providers and patients. Slow to embrace technology and innovation, these systems are now at a breaking point, with three in five people worldwide believing their healthcare is overstretched.

Accessibility remains a significant hurdle. In many countries, healthcare is prohibitively expensive and out of reach for many, even in regions with well-established infrastructures.

Have you ever felt unwell and resorted to Google or WebMD for answers? You're not alone. Millions do this daily, but these tools are often unreliable and can lead to misdiagnosis, exacerbating the problem rather than solving it.

**The Power Behind TRUE's AI: A Comprehensive Medical Database**

**Treatment AI (OTC:TREIF)** is an innovative healthcare tech company with a solution to these problems. They’ve developed a highly intelligent, personalized AI engine that helps doctors diagnose patient ailments more accurately and efficiently.

The image below demonstrates the customer journey when using the software, guiding users through steps to identify pain location, specify symptoms, report exposure and history, and receive diagnostic results based on their responses.

https://preview.redd.it/yx7lrxbebgid1.png?width=1521&format=png&auto=webp&s=cbe2a3c8b95b87fc03d416c589b7cc1e69238029

Now, you might be thinking a program like ChatGPT can do the exact same thing, but these large language models (“LLMs”) do not provide accurate or reliable information.

Unlike ChatGPT, TRUE’s AI software is non-generative, meaning it is all fact-based and cannot be contaminated. All of the possible answers that the software can output are already in the system.

The system is populated by the company’s proprietary Global Library of Medicine, which includes data on over 1,000 diseases and more than 10,000 symptoms and risk factors, all derived from real medical tests and peer-reviewed data.

TRUE’s proprietary Global Library of Medicine is one of the most comprehensive and integrated online medical libraries powered by AI. This database has taken more than 5 years, \~$10M, and input from hundreds of doctors worldwide to build.

Just how accurate is the software?

TRUE’s AI capabilities were tested by giving the software to an undergraduate non-medical student and letting the student take the OSCE exam – a medical school graduation requirement, testing clinical best practices, in 57 countries.

During the OSCE exam, medical students take turns going into 12 different rooms. Each room has a patient with a simulated medical condition which the student needs to diagnose by asking them questions and evaluating the patient’s answers.

The non-medical student using TRUE’s AI software passed the exam with a 92% success rate, correctly determining the “most likely diagnosis” in 11 of 12 complex diagnostic scenarios and the “second most likely diagnosis” in the 12th case.

In short, the software is incredibly accurate.

**The Market Opportunity**

**Treatment AI’s (OTC:TREIF)** customer base is segmented into two different areas: 1) ENT: for Enterprise and 2) MES: for Schools and Educators. The market opportunity for both segments is huge.

**Treatment ENT: Enhancing Enterprise Healthcare Solutions**

Treatment ENT leverages the GLM platform to provide enhanced clinical information support to healthcare enterprises and partners. This segment offers numerous applications, including integration with electronic medical records, health bots, virtual health services, medical call centers, and national triage services. The benefits for enterprises include expanded diagnostic support, integration with existing systems, more time for patient interactions, and reduced administrative costs. Additionally, Treatment ENT ensures security by sitting behind enterprise firewalls and opens up new revenue opportunities by enhancing existing healthcare services.

In the US alone, there are over 6,100 hospitals, 338,000 active physician group practices, and 1.1 million physicians. Globally, these numbers are obviously much greater.

**Treatment MES: Optimizing Performance in National Exams**

The Treatment MES platform is designed to support medical and nursing schools by streamlining the process of creating and grading national exams. It reduces the time, resources, and costs associated with exams such as MCQs and OSCEs, while minimizing administrative work. The platform ensures a consistent approach to case testing and scoring, provides suggested remedial guidance, and enhances school PR and intake processes. For students, Treatment MES offers the ability to practice for important exams, take remedial actions continuously, and access an authentic and always-available platform, ensuring they are well-prepared for their exams.

In the US, there are over 300 potential medical schools, 900 nursing schools, and hundreds of thousands of students.

**Strong Partnerships and Promising Pipeline**

The company already has several partnerships leveraging its technology and a strong pipeline of over 50 potential customers that are beginning to sign contracts—an excellent indication that the software is valuable to users. Notably, their partners include the prestigious Mayo Clinic and the University of Minnesota Medical School, both of which have substantial budgets and could lead to contracts worth six to seven figures in the near future.

A recent partnership with the AI tool marketplace aiXplain allows the company to claim 80% of the revenues, making their software the first healthcare solution on aiXplain’s platform. Additionally, their partnership with Novus Health exposes their software to an audience of 1.5 million members and their families.

**Potential Market Movers and Comparisons for TRUE**

There aren't many companies quite like TRUE. The closest comparable in the Canadian public market space is HealWELL AI, which has seen a huge surge of late, up over 220% in 2024.

Below is an image showing other similar players in the space — although, most are private and are much larger in size.

In the future, many of these companies are expected to go public with multi-billion dollar valuations. Those that don't will likely be acquired.

For instance, notable acquisitions in 2023 included NextGen Healthcare and Viewgol, which were bought at around 2.6 times revenue and 15 times EBITDA, respectively. Health Navigator, a private company similar to TRUE, was acquired by Amazon in October 2023 to support its Amazon Care service. Although mergers and acquisitions in this space have slowed recently, a resurgence could spark a re-rating of TRUE shares, especially if new deals or buyer interest emerge.

**Comparables Valuation**

The only other true comparable for Treatment AI in the Canadian public market space is HealWELL (TSX:AIDX). I have done a short comparable analysis with Treatment AI and HealWELL to highlight how deeply undervalued the company is.

https://preview.redd.it/tl8slgdobgid1.png?width=1122&format=png&auto=webp&s=09f00c9f4c0c4e4659ab962c2de6b2af70379b39

HealWELL currently has a market capitalization of \~$384mm and is trading at a 16.5x EV/sales multiple based on projected revenues for 2024. If we take this same multiple and apply it to TRUE’s projected 2024 revenues of $4.5mm, we get an implied relative valuation of $1.98 per share or 103% upside from current prices.

Looking forward to 2025, TRUE’s revenues are projected to increase to CAD$19mm. 

If we apply the 16.5x multiple to 2025 expected revenues of $19mm, we get an implied relative valuation of CAD$6.97 per share or 1180% upside from current prices. 

I have also factored in an additional 6M shares of dilution for a potential financing in 2025.

Keep in mind that this is a conservative estimate as it does not factor in two key points.

Firstly, not all of HealWELL’s revenues are considered to be “AI revenues”, whereas all of TRUE’s revenues are. AI revenues are valued at a higher multiple than medical service revenues in today’s market.

Secondly, TRUE’s margins (84-95%) are higher than HealWELL’s (70-80%), which is not reflected in the above comparable analysis.

Thus, in reality, the per share valuation figure should be even higher.

**High-Margin SaaS Model and New Product Launches**

The company focuses on software subscription revenue, which lets them enjoy strong profit margins between 84% and 95%. Since they don't have to pay providers for access to users, more revenue goes straight to the bottom line, benefiting shareholders.

They're also planning to launch two new monthly SaaS products: AI Patient for educational purposes and AI Doctor in a Pocket for enterprise use. These high-margin products are the fastest way for the company to generate revenue, offering efficient software solutions to both current and new partners.

**The Bottom Line**

Treatment AI (OTC:TREIF) is set to revolutionize the healthcare industry with its innovative AI technology. By addressing critical challenges in diagnostics and offering reliable, fact-based solutions, they are transforming how healthcare is delivered. Their comprehensive medical database and proven diagnostic accuracy underscore their potential.

With significant partnerships already in place and a focus on high-margin, subscription-based revenue, Treatment AI is well-positioned for sustainable growth. The company's dual focus on enterprise and educational sectors opens vast market opportunities, making them a compelling choice for investors.

As AI continues to drive advancements across industries, Treatment AI stands out as a leader in healthcare innovation. Their commitment to improving patient care and their strategic market positioning ensure they are not just part of the AI revolution—they are at the forefront. For investors seeking significant returns and a stake in the future of healthcare, Treatment AI is a promising opportunity."

1ered0f,1,2024-08-13,Seeking Advice on Transitioning to Physics After a PhD in Health Economics,u/Other_Procedure1971,PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1ered0f/seeking_advice_on_transitioning_to_physics_after/,"Hi everyone,

I’m currently in the midst of pursuing a PhD in Health Economics in Germany (and I'm from another European country). I’m in my mid-20s, and if everything goes according to plan, I should finish my PhD by the time I’m 27 or 28. While I’m passionate about economics and enjoy my research, I’ve found myself increasingly drawn to the idea of studying physics, particularly the thought of engaging with frontier research.

To give you a bit of background without revealing too much for privacy reasons, I initially chose to study economics during my undergraduate years, largely out of a fear that I wouldn’t be able to handle the more challenging coursework in a subject like physics. Now, after come years of academic experience and research, I feel more confident in my ability to tackle difficult subjects and am seriously considering starting from scratch with a bachelor’s degree in physics once I complete my current PhD.

My ultimate goal is to dive deep into the world of physics by completing a full academic path in the field. This would involve starting with a bachelor’s degree, followed by a master’s, and eventually pursuing a PhD in physics. Although I’m still refining my specific interests, I’m particularly drawn to the fundamental study of matter, as well as the more mathematical and theoretical aspects of physics. Additionally, I’m intrigued by the potential to bridge physics and economics, exploring interdisciplinary research that could combine insights from both fields. 

Here are a few questions I’d appreciate your insights on:

1. **Is it realistic to start over with a bachelor's in physics after completing a PhD in another field?** Have there been cases of people successfully transitioning from a completely different discipline to physics at this stage in life? 
2. **How can I leverage the skills and experiences from my PhD in Health Economics to succeed as a physics student?** Are there any transferable skills that might give me a head start? 
3. **Financial sustainability:** How feasible is it to study physics while working, either within academia in my current field (economics) or potentially in industry? Are there common pathways where one can balance both? I’m also curious about opportunities to teach or do research part-time in economics while pursuing a physics degree, or if it would be more practical to find a job in the industry that aligns better with this new academic path.
4. **Career prospects:** After completing a PhD in physics, how might my career opportunities be affected compared to staying in my current field? Would I be limiting my prospects, or could I open up new possibilities? Are there specific careers where I could fully leverage expertise in both economics and physics?

Thank you in advance for any advice, experiences, or guidance you can offer! This is a big decision for me, and I’m trying to gather as much information as possible to make an informed choice.

1erixc5,8,2024-08-13,Just set my first boundary with a friend?!?,u/Level-Sprinkles200,adhdwomen,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1erixc5/just_set_my_first_boundary_with_a_friend/,"I’m a chronic people pleaser to the detriment of my own physical health and mental health and I just finished my first semester of school (mature student) and am SO excited to enjoy my much needed 3 week break before fall semester starts!!! 

One of my close friends (who I met at a previous job) has been talking to me about the same issues I had at the job (very toxic workplace) for the past year. Today, she messaged me and I let her rant a bit because we all need a listening ear. I tried to provide practical steps she could take to look for a new job and shared what I found helpful, some websites, and recruiters emails I had. 

She was asking me for more help after that that would require me to spend more time researching and going on LinkedIn etc. I explained how what I found most helpful was just buying the bullet, making a few different versions of a resume, and then applying to jobs. 

I was super eager to help at first and did spend time tracking down all these resources for her but then I also caught myself in the same pattern that I always do. Finally get a break, and then immediately fill it up helping everybody else and get nothing done that I need to get done. 

I then very kindly explained to her that I just started my break from school and my brain desperately needs a break from all things school, LinkedIn, etc. in order to prepare for the upcoming fall and winter semester. I also said how I was taking a LinkedIn break and really needed to be off the platform for the 3 weeks so I can come back refreshed. 

This was SUPER hard for me to do. My instinct was to drop my afternoon plans of sitting outside and reading my book in the beautiful weather to sit on my laptop and find jobs for her. But I also know that this won’t help her, and her learning how to search for jobs will be a super valuable skill that will benefit her a lot. 

I feel like a bad friend but I also know realistically, I spent 2 hours talking with her today, and then spent over another hour sending her links to companies, job boards, YouTube Channels, and recruiters emails. I also shared how I used ChatGPT in the past to help me write a resume and cover letter (what prompts I found most helpful). 

On paper, I know I helped her and I need to start learning how to take care of myself. I have a well deserved and earned break and I need to relax. If I burn myself out helping her, then there will be nothing left for me. I’m unsure if it’s an ADHD things but I always find I immediately jump in and go above and beyond to help everybody, which often is to my detriment. I also rarely find that anybody else in my life has the same reaction - besides the point. 

I’m super proud of myself for setting this boundary. It also feels extra exhausting because I ran into these same problems and left this job over a year ago and it feels hard to move on because I’m constantly being told about all of the same drama and issues. But setting that boundary will be a work in progress (any tips for that???). It just feels like it’s hard for me to move on when I constantly hear about it. But I want to be a good friend, so it’s hard to navigate. "

1erpmgx,1,2024-08-13,AITAH for almost entirely redoing a ppt and giving my opinion on something involved with that?,u/Introvertedtravelgrl,AITAH,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1erpmgx/aitah_for_almost_entirely_redoing_a_ppt_and/,"PLEASE, PLEASE Help. Sorry it's a long one.

I recently did some work for an organization and have been seriously wondering if I've overstepped or done something wrong. Because of this, you're not likely to get kickback from me if I AITAH. 

So I applied to do something else with this organization (unfortunately I have to be vague about some this while being as honest as possible) but was contacted to help them with something else in the interim only temporarily with the understanding that I would be able to do the position I originally applied for in the fall. 

Main responsibilities (as understood them) were to: critique teacher lesson plans for anything that didn't meet the guidlines of the organization (I wasn't really given any specific guidelines but I went with what I knew of the mission and teaching in general) and report anything concerning to my supervisor. The other responsibility was to help with a very important ppt presentation. My supervisor either wasn't thoroughly familiar with all the workings of PPT or didn't care but asked me to clean it up, make edits and add content to areas I was familiar with (things I had reports for or direct information). So I did. My supervisor was a lovely person, truly but really bad at communicating in a clear, concise organized way. I tried to leave the position early on because of the communication issue, without mentioning it but I was persuaded to continue on, so I did. 

So during the critique part, I delicately asked about a teacher's comments on (the plans were pretty empty) and what I got was mild defensiveness. So I stopped asking and didn't really intensively critique anymore. Then the PPT, I got a barrage of different emails with various instructions and files, as my supervisor refused to communicate by phone when I wasn't working in the same place. So I tried my best to do what was asked, ploughing through the emails, trying to make sense of them and reply. All the while, my supervisor sending me flowery compliments and gratitude on my work. By the end of the week, on a Friday, I thought I had finished everything, but late that night my supervisor sends more stuff and more requests for the PPT. So I do it, but they also send other conclicting emails ""Can you do this by this day?"" ""You don't have to do more"" etc. I was so confused, on top of the fact I never said I was available on weekends but I did it. Then Sunday I get more emails and one seems like it wants me to add more content and edit and another seems like it was indirectly saying thanks but stop touching the PPT. 

Truthfully, the PPT before I got to it was awful. Using those pre-created templates of 'put picture here' and 'text here'. And SOOOO MUCH text all over the slide. So I just used chatgpt to take the content and condense it so it was digestible and then reformatted the slides to be more viewer friendly. While doing that I was also reading teacher comments on students and one of them said something that I thought seemed not nice about a student, so I mentioned it and my supervisor seemed irritated that I mentioned it. Anyway, I stopped working on the PPT. They thanked me and I asked about the position that was dangled like a carrot in front of me from the beginning, and they said they I just needed to contact so and so. But here's the weird part, they said, ""I spoke to the person in charge of that position and they're really excited to meet with you"" but doesn't give me their name, instead tells me to contact another person (that I had initially been in contact with) and also asks me to log my hours (this is not a paid position) which I hadn't been told to or how to at all in the beginning (really poor communication) so  I emailed the person she told me to plus the person who set up my technology account, and prior to the powerpoint both people had been very responsive. Now? Ghost town. 

The PPT was theirs, but they seemed to tell me to edit it where necessary. That seemed to be my job. Now I'm wondering whether I am the AH for putting so much work into it and maybe they perceived it as arrogance? I'm spinning in an anxiety circle wondering if this is my fault and I have something I need to fix about my interactions or it really was an unfixable situation to start and I got pulled into an existing bad situation. (I received zero training on anything, and anything I did learn I had to teach myself by googling the shit out of.)

I'm not going to follow up because I already feel like I've been scolded even though every email was flattery, but it was so thick you could tell it wasn't all genuine. 

Any thoughts on this would be greatly appreciated. I bear no ill-will on anyone involved, I'm just so disappointed \[and feel like shit\] how this turned out as I really want to be of help and also hoped I would be able to do the position I applied for."

Took me two weeks to pass this god forsaken class. I have never had as miserable a time in a class as this one. 

  
Memorizing block sizes, key sizes, and rounds for each cipher is ridiculous. If I wanted to become a rolodex of cryptographic ciphers I would have done that myself. In all my years of working, I have never needed to know deep and dirty specifics, they have always been available to freely access. I do not know how the people in charge can justify this. We should be prioritizing methods, techniques, procedures, use cases, etc. not these fact sheets. FISH was used during WWll, I have no reason for remembering it besides the fact that it WAS used (even that is negligible). 

The book is garbage, mistakes are much too numerous to base the class off of. I would not even read that garbage, just google the chapter requirements and learn from chatgpt or use the student drive. Then memorize the notes you have taken for them.

  
Two weeks of stress for a needless class. Fuck it, just get that degree. "
1ersrcj,1,2024-08-14,Difference between ChatGPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet,u/aivala,u_aivala,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_aivala/comments/1ersrcj/difference_between_chatgpt4o_and_claude_35_sonnet/,"# Introduction: What is AI？

First, let's briefly explain AI. AI is a computer program with human-like intelligence. Recent AI has been able to do various things such as human conversations, writing, and understanding images.

The two AI introduced this time, GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, are particularly good at natural language processing (ability to understand and generate human language) (large language model) It is an AI called.

[ChatGPT-4o Vs Claude 3.5 Sonnet](https://preview.redd.it/ulfn8cfe5kid1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b68b8595bc96b87a26cbcbc42893540f76b86664)

# What is GPT-4o？

The GPT-4o is the latest AI model developed by OpenAI. OpenAI is a company founded by Elon Musk and others, and is famous for AI research and development.

# Features of GPT-4o：

* You can have human-like conversations
* Can solve complex problems
* Write creative sentences
* Understand and explain images

GPT-4o has evolved further from its previous version (GPT-4), allowing for more natural dialogue and advanced reasoning.

# What is Claude 3.5 Sonnet？

Claude 3.5 Sonnet is an AI model developed by Anthropic. Anthropic is known for its emphasis on AI safety and ethics.

Claude 3.5 Sonnet Features：

* Advanced analytical ability
* Can make ethical decisions
* Can explain complex concepts
* High image understanding ability

Claude 3.5 Sonnet is developed with a focus on safety and performance balance.

# Comparison of two AI

Both GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet are very high performance AI, but each has its own characteristics. Let's compare here from several perspectives.

a) Knowledge level Both AI also have extensive university level knowledge. However, looking at the test results, Claude 3.5 Sonnet seems a little better in many areas.

For example：

* Postgraduate reasoning ability
* Undergraduate general knowledge
* Coding （ Programming ） Ability

Claude 3.5 Sonnet has a higher score in these areas.

b) Math ability When it comes to math problem-solving ability, the GPT-4o seems to be a little better. In particular, GPT-4o tends to give more accurate answers in high school math issues.

c) Visual comprehension ability The ability to understand and explain images is very high with both AI. However, Claude 3.5 Sonnet gives a slightly better result in interpreting graphs and charts, understanding scientific diagrams, and more.

d) Safety and Ethics Claude 3.5 Sonnet is developed with a greater focus on safety and ethics. Special training is provided to avoid producing harmful content or inappropriate information.

The GPT-4o is also safe, but it may not be as strict as Claude 3.5 Sonnet.

e) Ease of use GPT-4o tends to interact in a more natural conversational tone. Claude 3.5 Sonnet, on the other hand, tends to provide more logical and analytical answers.

Which one is easier to use will change depending on your preferences and uses.

**Actual Showdown: 10 Challenges**

We prepared 10 challenges and asked two AI to try to compare the actual performance that we don't know by the numbers alone. Here are three results that were of particular interest to me.

**a) Summary of highly specialized papers**

In the task of summarizing difficult academic papers, GPT-4o surprisingly did better.

GPT-4o answers：

* Explain the contents of the paper in more detail
* Description including specific number （ accuracy improved by 21.94% ）
* Easy to read with logical configuration

Claude 3.5 Sonnet's answer：

* The overview is accurate, but few details
* No specific numerical reference
* Stay a little general explanation

The result was amazing. Claude 3.5 Sonnet had a higher score in the benchmark test.

However, there are some caveats. This challenge may also involve the ability of AI to read PDF files. In other words, it may affect the results not only the ability to understand the paper purely, but also how accurately the data in the form PDF can be read.

**b) High school math problem solving**

In the task of presenting and answering high school-level math problems in images, both AI solved the problem exactly, but there was a difference in how they were explained.

GPT-4o：

* Detailed answer process
* Easy wording for high school students
* Visual description using the diagram

Claude 3.5 Sonnet：

* Provide accurate answer
* Use somewhat professional terminology
* Explanation centered on mathematical expressions

Both came to the correct answer, but it can be said that the GPT-4o provided a more educational explanation.

**c) Issues that require ethical judgment**

Both AI provided interesting answers in the challenge of seeking comment on ethical issues regarding the use of AI.

GPT-4o：

* Analyze problems from a polygonal perspective
* Explained with specific cases
* Make no conclusions and leave the judgment to the user

Claude 3.5 Sonnet：

* Analysis based on ethical perspective
* Explanation including legal and regulatory perspectives
* Trend to take a more cautious position

In this challenge, Claude 3.5 Sonnet tended to make more cautious and ethical decisions. This may reflect Anthropic's safety-focused policy.

# AI evolution and our future

Through the confrontation between GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, you can see how AI's capabilities are evolving. The dream-like ability just a few years ago is now a reality.

For example：

* Natural conversation like a human
* Solving complex problems
* Image understanding and description
* Ethical judgment

These abilities can have a significant impact on our lives and jobs. For example：

* Education: Learning support tailored to individual students
* Medical: Diagnostic support and new drug development
* Business: data analysis and decision support
* Creation activities: auxiliary for ideas and writing

However, there are challenges in the evolution of AI. For example：

* Privacy issues: AI deals with large amounts of personal data
* Impact on employment: AI automation of work
* Ethical issues: the impact of AI judgment
* Dependence issues: The danger that humans rely too much on AI

Addressing these challenges while maximizing the benefits of AI is our challenge.

**How to get along with AI？**

Finally, I've put together some advice on how we should go out with AI.

a) AI that uses AI as a tool is very good, but it is a tool only. The final judgment should be made by humans.

b) Knowing the limits of AI AI AI can make mistakes. Be especially careful with the latest information and where ethical judgment is required.

c) Don't inadvertently teach personal information to AI who cares about privacy.

d) Care for creativity AI is convenient, but also for creative thinking that can only be done by humans.

e) Continuously learning AI technology is progressing daily. It is important to be interested in the latest trends and continue to learn.

# In the heart of

Through the confrontation between GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, we have seen the wonders and challenges of the latest AI technology. 

Both AIs have amazing abilities, but each one has its own characteristics, and which one is generally better.

AI has the potential to make our lives richer. At the same time, it can cause problems depending on how you use it. It is important to get along wisely.  
  
I hope you found this information very useful. The world of AI is evolving every day, and a future beyond our imagination may be waiting.

some time ago i did somewhat well for an assignment, and my teacher praised me infront of the entire class. as someone who already hates being the centre of attention, i just wanted to dig a hole into a ground and hide. i feel extremely pressured to continue scoring well since my teacher set that expectation of me infront of everyone and i feel like an imposter pretending to be someone smart and talented. 

i hate it so much whenever i voice my anxiety about exams and my friends mention how i’m a “liar” and that i’m the “top scorer in class who always does well” rather than comforting me like they do for others. i genuinely have so much anxiety or stress over it, but it’s like they completely disregard it, which i find upsetting. but is this a me problem? am i in the wrong here without realising it 😭 and sometimes when we get back results they fake annoyance with me when i actually do well instead of showing support, which i guess is normal between friends but it doesn’t diminish my feelings because i have never flexed my results to anyone before, not even on social media or anything. instead i usually just get secretly happy and keep quiet about it. i get so so embarrassed when people point it out it makes me want to shrivel up like a raisin.

i guess what i’m trying to say is that i wish i didn’t do so well to the point where others notice or even worse, see me as a threat. am i overthinking this? am i in the wrong for not putting in 100% of the work before exams? i really really hate feeling like this sm 😭😭 "

I feel so demoralised because i spend most of my free time studying whenever I can, even staying in during the weekends and sacrificing my hobbies to study. I feel so jealous whenever I see my classmates getting higher GPAs (3.5-3.7 range) while not studying as much as me and maintaining a good social life. I constantly wonder what I'm doing wrong but I can never seem to find the answer, and i feel like all the effort that i poured into studying really went down the drain.  I'm so tired of forcing myself to study for hours only to achieve grades that are mediocre compared to my peers, and its been  like this since the semester started. Most of my grades aren't even that good and now that ESE's are approaching, I really don't feel like studying, or bring myself to at least. Everytime I feel confident about how I performed in a test, I would still end up with a B or a C. If anyone saw my gpa right now they'd probably assume that I'd be the type to slack in group projects/ skip classes. I'm so tired of putting so much effort into studying and not seeing one bit of it show up in my results. I feel so devastated right now because I recently got a B- for a module that I actually enjoyed studying for, because no matter how hard i study the content the test questions would be completely different than I expected. Also i find it quite difficult to concentrate while studying, everything feels like a dream and i can't really bring myself to focus (idk how to explain it) and sleep isn't a problem because i make sure to get 7-8 hours of sleep. At this point i'd be satisfied with a gpa that is at least above 3, I'm so tired of not seeing my hardwork show into my results, and i can't even motivate myself by thinking my grades would improve because they haven't. I honestly miss the traditional secondary school style of learning as it was more slow paced and fits my learning style way more than poly does, but sadly i didn't do well enough to get into jc. I'm so done with this, I can't wait to graduate poly and maybe do something else that I might enjoy. And if you're still reading this I just wanna say thanks for staying till the end :)

1es659v,1,2024-08-14,ChatGPT's Impact on Virtual Learning in Education and Corporate Training Environments,u/cporter202,ChatGPTautomation,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTautomation/comments/1es659v/chatgpts_impact_on_virtual_learning_in_education/,"As we delve deeper into the 21st century, technology continues to reshape myriad aspects of life, education, and work. One of the latest innovations at the frontier is OpenAI's ChatGPT, a potent tool that's changing the landscapes of virtual learning in both the education sector and corporate training environments.

ChatGPT's ability to understand and generate human-like text has made it an incredibly resourceful assistant for learners and trainers alike. In educational institutes, this AI can help create more interactive study materials and simulate one-on-one tutoring experiences for students. Learners can query the system in natural language, getting instant explanations on complex topics, or assistance with practice exercises. This can be particularly transformative in settings with limited human resources.

In the corporate realm, ChatGPT is reinventing employee training and development. It's enabling personalized learning experiences at scale, allowing employees to train at their own pace and on demand. From onboarding to ongoing professional development, ChatGPT can supply immediate, relevant information and training, fostering a culture of continuous learning and adaptation.

The implications are vast – educators can leverage ChatGPT to design curriculum and assessments, while corporate trainers can structure entire training programs around the technology. Moreover, the potential for language learning, soft skill development, and intricate technical training suggests a future where the boundaries of knowledge expansion are significantly lessened.

However, challenges such as ensuring quality control, maintaining engagement, and addressing ethical considerations of AI in education and training must be met with thoughtful strategies.

Let's discuss how ChatGPT is impacting virtual learning and how we can best harness this technology to enhance educational outcomes and corporate efficiency. How do you see AI like ChatGPT shaping the future of learning and professional development? Share your experiences, ideas, and any concerns you might have about this technological evolution."
1esawkt,6,2024-08-14,"CMV: AI has the ability to ""break"" society in the next years",u/outm,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1esawkt/cmv_ai_has_the_ability_to_break_society_in_the/,"For context, I'm a CS person working on tech and ""kinda"" related to processes we're adding ""AI"" into (yeah, I know, a lot of times AI is just a buzzword for things that are not \*really\* AI) - so this isn't a post from someone thinking of AI like ""magic"".

But still, I'm worried for all the tech entails when it comes to the general public and businesses and all its capabilities, which are quickly enough improving at a high speed and as a tool, allow you to either raise the potential to do good and bad things. Why I'm worried? Some motives for me:

* **Adding random background noise**: AI is being used (and more every day) as a cheap ghost-writing for a lot of webpages and blogs that are trying to cut real people writers wages, or as leads/SEO for businesses, scams and referral-sites. This means we end up losing the ability to find ""real useful"" info on the internet, we are more exposed to find ""confidently wrong"" answers (like when Google AI was recommending people to eat rocks as a healthy habit) and the internet consuption of resources are potential going to be higher and higher (so more energy consumed) just because the generation of that data, storage and serving it.

* **Worsening average educational system effectiveness**: AI can be used for good on education, of course ( for example, helping create, explain and resolve problems, or practising a new language on a chat and making corrections) but I think the potential ""bad"" for the average student will be net loss. Students have it easier than ever to just pass through AI problems they ""should have"" to resolve themselves to practise and find struggles to learn, to write essays that should require a lot of reading, synthesis and writing/explaining skills and just ""cheat"" - homeworks are effectively dead on its majority and the work in-class can be compromised (and it's limited: you can't do multi-hour essays like a degree thesis on class). People won't work hard for 100hr if the next person is doing a similar good enoug job in 5hr (but, without learning that much).

* **Adding more to the gap rich-poor people**: it was recently reported on another reddit thread-article, that HR are overwhelmed by receiving resumes made with AI - but not only that, they demonstrated that being a paying user of an AI service like ChatGPT gets you better probabilities given the output is of better quality and ""differential"" to those of the free version. Similarly, it can happen again with education: the kid that happens to be able to access a paid AI service will be ahead of the poor kid who isn't able to get it, given both use it. This means AI is essentially helping ""richer"" people to get ahead of ""poor"" people on education or job work/opportunities simply by putting a tiered paywall into the qualities of the tech. You pay more, you get more. It has the potential to add for the gap rich-poor.

* **Dehumanizing art and cultural creations**: It's well-known AI is getting/gonna be used to write scripts, images, videos, ""paintings"", poems, videogames stories and assets, parts of books and so on. Those creations are just based on the AI learned and integrated huge data base of previous human creations (so, usually won't be creating ""new"" paths) and will be hugely trained to just make creations that are the most possible success. So for example, niche or risky cultural creations will be passed more easily. The AI thinks the idea of ""Matrix"" is niche and less success-prone than a Marvel movie? Welcome to a timeline where Matrix is never made, but we have 60 Marvel movies. Also, this trends have the ability to discourage coming into arts careers.

* **Less jobs and crappier services and products**: We are seeing lots of companies considering using AI to cut positions and jobs, even if sometimes it means a loss of quality, because ""it's worth it"". You can make a 8/10 videogame paying a team of 10 to develop the story and script, or make a 6,5/10 videogame paying a team of 2 to do the same. Now, multiple for bigger companies. Customer service? I can pay peanuts for an offshore customer service (because employing good quality local people is too expensive, of course) or even cut that and expect the AI resolves your problem. If some customers end up on a loop and leaving the company, that's just a calculated risk and price for the money saved. Not too far ahead I'm even seeing a future where ""poor"" people is derived (as an ""apartheid"" system) to AI systems by insurances and private healthcare systems, while richer ones are prioritised to be treated by humans and better doctors.

* **Increasing many folds fake news and disinformation**: As recently was reported, now X allows users using its AI to, for example, generate pics of Kamala Harris with guns or Pope Francis sniffing cocaine (in fact, last year became viral a pic of Pope Francis wearing a large puffy, made by AI). AI will help people to just get deeper into echo-chambers, be paranoid, build political distrust and polarisation.

* **Breaking ""justice"" potential evidences**: Until now, a public place recording, a conversation at some contexts, pics or just ""I plead guilty"" recorded confessions could be taken sometimes as ""hard"" evidence. Now, AI is building a future where that data can be easily turned ""trash"" and not valid, no matter the metadata, not only because it will be easy to make false evidences, but also good alibis.

* **Increasing incentive and ability to compromise people privacy (and increasing stuff, food and services prices)**: Now it's easier than ever to just use AI to proccess and interlink multiple ""users touchpoints"", metadata, interactions and even what they do or where they travel to, to try and sell more. As an example, recently was reported multiple supermarket are starting to work into ""unique grocery store for every customer"", because analysing each person and their probability to pay for someone at a given cost, allows you to charge the maximum price to each person. Random example: Tom needs a cartridge to work, is known, and is a usual customer that doesn't hesitate when taking it from the self. Emma has just bought a new printer and is still on the returns period. At 60$, Tom will buy and Emma will return the printer and find an alternative. At $80 for Tom and $20 for Emma, Tom buys, Emma keeps the printer and buys, and then you will be able to raise her price.

  
Not only am I worried about the future society where AI is a part of us, but also think for the common people, the ending net is a loss. For a few people (usually, richest ones, big businesses and so on) it will be a huge boost and even allow the biggest sharks to control the market and avoid newcomers from growing and taking their places, damaging economy on the long run as the ""too big to fail"" will just accomodate (Google, Microsoft, whatever)

So... what do you think? Thanks."

I know that the best way to learn is by doing projects and I can do that. I have done plenty of projects like this but with the help of google or chatgpt. Now when I think about it, I think I can’t do or understand anything myself without the help of gpt or google. To make it worst, I tried freelancing(upwork) but despite a lot of effort I was unable to land a single job. 

Is this normal or am I missing something. I am right now trying to learn ML and this thought is haunting me day and night. I tried to learn it by following a structured path but got stuck in tutorial hell. 

Kindly help me with this. How can I learn things efficiently? When do know that I am good in a particular field? Tell me how you do things at industrial level because if things continue like this I won’t be able to get a job during/ after graduation. How can I become the best out there? What type of projects should I build to get a job as MLE?

I need a mentor who can guide me throughout this whole process.

Note: I am not good at writing, so if there are any mistakes kindly ignore.

1esv22f,55,2024-08-15,Limiting the length and scope of responses,u/Acceptable_Month9310,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1esv22f/limiting_the_length_and_scope_of_responses/,"One thing I find that ChatGPT (and even just poor students) do is to take the shotgun approach.  When I ask them ""Explain this issue to me"" their response will be a series of vague statements about 3-5x longer than any reasonable answer.  This not only takes much longer to mark but these ""kitchen sink"" responses leave me with the impression that the student really hasn't learned anything.

So, in light of this I ran a course this summer where I took an exercise which requires you to write a few short explanations on a particular scenario and put significant length limits on each one.  This includes both straight-up word limits and limiting topics.  ""Express one idea that you consider the best approach to X"".  I point out that anything over the word limit or if you express more than one idea this extra text is simply not read.

I'm just comparing these things now and this seems to produce better work.  In fact, I'm thinking of dropping some of the word counts even more. Anyone have similar experiences?

I also created a specific form that every student has to use, this stops the handing in of increasingly elaborate ""art projects"" where students use title pages, odd text layouts and just far more effort into aesthetics than a simple weekly assignment warrants.  Call me cynical but I suspect several of these are an attempt to try and avoid getting caught by TurnItIn"
1eszmyu,1,2024-08-15,Leveraging ChatGPT for Data Analysis and Reporting in Diverse Industries,u/cporter202,ChatGPTautomation,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTautomation/comments/1eszmyu/leveraging_chatgpt_for_data_analysis_and/,"In today's data-driven world, the role of AI, and particularly language models like ChatGPT, in data analysis and reporting cannot be understated. With industries ranging from finance to healthcare, and from retail to manufacturing, the potential for leveraging such technology is immense.

ChatGPT, with its advanced natural language processing abilities, is enhancing the way we handle data analysis and reporting. For example, in the finance sector, ChatGPT can assist analysts by summarizing complex financial reports, interpreting stock market trends, and even providing insights into vast datasets that humans might take much longer to analyze.

In healthcare, the implications are equally significant. ChatGPT can process patient data, understand medical histories, and assist in creating comprehensive reports that can help healthcare professionals make better-informed decisions. The technology can condense information from various patient interactions to provide a holistic view of a patient's medical journey.

Retail companies are harnessing ChatGPT to analyze customer feedback, market trends, and sales data, automating the reporting process and consequently enabling data-driven strategies that boost customer satisfaction and business growth. By interpreting consumer behavior patterns, ChatGPT can inform marketing strategies and help tailor the retail experience to individual needs.

Manufacturing is another sector where data analysis and reporting are crucial. ChatGPT can swiftly process quality control data, supply chain information, and production metrics, turning these into actionable insights that can streamline processes and mitigate risks.

Educational organizations, too, are finding ChatGPT invaluable for analyzing student performance data and feedback, which can inform personalized teaching methods and improve educational resources.

However, the implementation of ChatGPT in such diverse industries is not without challenges. Privacy concerns, data security, and the need for contextual understanding are just some hurdles that need to be addressed to ensure reliable and ethical use of this technology.

Indeed, the benefits of incorporating ChatGPT into data analysis and reporting across various industries are profound, but they require thoughtful integration with existing systems and workflows. How industries adapt and manage these advanced AI tools will shape the future of data-driven decision-making. Let's engage in a thoughtful discussion on best practices, experiences, and potential barriers to leveraging ChatGPT for data analysis and reporting across different sectors. Your insights and expertise could help pave the way forward for AI's role in transforming industry landscapes."

Generative AI models like ChatGPT opened up a whole world of opportunity to use AI writing for any task requiring text. Everyone then expected that students would then use AI-generated content for academic writing. Perhaps what people didn't expect is [reportedly half of American students using AI for schoolwork](https://www.bestcolleges.com/research/most-college-students-have-used-ai-survey/).

Academia’s response to this phenomenon was to integrate AI detectors like Turnitin into their student submission portals so that everything they submit passes through a plagiarism checker.

ChatGPT will almost always fail to bypass Turnitin, so people look at different AI writing tools such as AI paraphrasers or Stealth AI to bypass detection systems. You might be asking yourself though, do AI paraphrasers work?

# What Is An AI Paraphraser?

An AI Paraphraser takes AI-generated text and simply rewords and rephrases it. It gives you snappier synonyms and injects a little style, maybe simplifies for clarity. The two major AI paraphrasing tools that do this are Grammarly and Quillbot.

Here's the rub though, the paraphrasers do change the text around, but they don’t neccesarily remove the watermarks of AI writing. And because those watermarks are still present, they can just as easily fail AI detection as if you were to use ChatGPT.

# What is Turnitin?

Turnitin is the most popular and commonly used AI content detector. It’s detection system isn’t just an AI checker, it’s a plagiarism checker as well. Turnitin AI Detection takes every measure to ensure the text you submit are your own words.

Still, even Turnitin will give false positives at a 4% rate on the sentence-level. It also commonly lets AI writing bypass as human writing. Many academic institutions have settled on the notion that [AI detectors don’t work](https://mitsloanedtech.mit.edu/ai/teach/ai-detectors-dont-work/), but for most, they have no other option.

# How Does Turnitin Detection Work?

ChatGPT's content is always written with the same algorithm that generates the simplest, most precise text in terms of word choice, sentence length, and sentence structure. The readability of the content is low and often doesn’t include the proper citation, even making up references at times.

Turnitin Detection works by analyzing the text to find the watermarks of AI writing. Those watermarks are measured as perplexity and burstiness, or in other words, the simplicity of words and sentences.

# How to Bypass Turnitin AI Detection

In order to bypass Turnitin or any AI detection tool, You have to manipulate the watermarks of AI writing. An AI paraphraser doesn’t neccesarily do that, but it inadvertently might in rephrasing the text. One should assume at least, that the text feels more human than the original ChatGPT output.

Here’s an essay I just asked ChatGPT to write about Adam Sandler movies:

As you can see, the writing style features low perplexity and readability coupled with precise word choice and sentences.

# Can Turnitin Detect Grammarly?

The Grammarly treatment allows me to take many suggestions with what to do with the text from rewording a few sentences to generating an entirely rephrased essay.

So, here's what ChatGPT's essay looks like are taking Grammarly’s suggestions to rephrase it completely:

Grammarly's suggested revision is in the text box that appears on the right. That's what we're going to pass through Turnitin to determine if AI paraphrasing is a good way to bypass AI detection tools.

Below we demonstrate what happens when our new AI Paraphraserized essay is passed through Turnitin:

Turnitin determined Grammarly’s rephrased Adam Sandler essay was still 95% AI Generated. So, one can conclude that yes, Turnitin can detect Grammarly.

Whether you pass it through a detector or read the text yourself, you will Grammarly couldn't remove the watermarks of AI writing. Paraphrased content isn’t humanized content. You can’t paraphrase AI text and expect it to bypass AI content detection.

The only way to submit AI-written content and have it bypass any detector from [Originality.AI](http://Originality.AI), to GPTZero, and of course, Turnitin AI detector, is using an AI humanizer to make the text undetectable.

# Can Undetectable AI Bypass Turnitin?

Undetectable AI is the how you would categorize text that has run through an undetectable service. However, because so many of these services are still caught by Turnitin’s radar, either because they’re outdated or never worked in the first place, the only way to make your text truly undetectable is going one level higher with Stealth AI.

Using StealthGPT’s Stealth AI system, we’re going to humanize our original Adam Sandler essay and see if it fares better against Turnitin than Grammarly.

Here’s how that essay looks passed through Stealth AI:

There it is in the output panel. It reads better already. And here’s the result after we pass it through Turnitin:

As you can see, Turnitin determined the Stealth AI text was 0% AI writing. Flawless victory.

# Conclusion

AI Paraphrasers are really only useful for correcting and rephrasing human writing. Any hope of bettering AI writing or making AI writing bypass Turnitin or any AI writing detection service isn't based in reality.

If you really want to bypass Turnitin and improve the writing style of a piece of AI text, you need to humanize it so it can have the perplexity and flow of human text.

The only way to do this is with an undetectable AI service and the only undetectable AI service guaranteed to deliver consistent results comes at the hands of StealthGPT’s unparralled Stealth AI.

# FAQ

# Can Turnitin Detect ChatGPT?

Absolutely. OpenAI created ChatGPT with writing skills for a specific purpose: Utility. Thus, the words and sentences need to always be simple and precise. ChatGPT doesn’t have the machine learning to sound human, so it always sounds like AI and Turnitin will always be able to detect it.

If you're interested in [how to make ChatGPT undetectable](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/make-chatgpt-undetectable), read our guide.

# Is Using ChatGPT plagiarism?

ChatGPT and other generative AI models only create original content. If you were to pass a research paper written by ChatGPT through an old fashioned plagiarism detection tool, it wouldn’t determine that you stole any words without crediting the original author.

However, whether using generative AI to write your research paper undermines academic integrity is a separate issue. In many cases it does, even though so many students are using it. That’s why many universities make the distinction of calling it “AI plagiarism”.

My project ideas usually come from my own necessity, like I wanted to know which stocks reddit recommends, so I made a website for that.

For projects I will highly recommend you to **make something you WANT to make.** Even if its outside AIML you can consider doing it (the person was AI focused but the advice is generic). I am currently learning how to make a text editor in Golang, which is harder than making a compiler for reference, so I will be having that in my resume next. Even tho its not related to aiml it showcases my ability to learn fast and improves core knowledge as well.

Like initially, if you have never made an aiml project, you will ofc have to start with the basics, house price and song recommendation models, just wanted to mention that.

**Tldr:** So yeah, totally go for what you wish to make. Got this advice from Primeagen as well.

**“What platforms did you follow? Sources on YouTube?”**

Mindset is really important, and to build it you need the right companionship, what content you consume etc. I can recommend you some YouTubers I love, and so can anybody on Reddit. The thing is that its veryy subjective and if you blindly follow anyone's recommendations you are more likely to waste time here. What you should do instead is go to different resources like diff utubers, profs, books and examine if you are really learning a lot from them. Most utubers are in just for the bucks, you need to determine which are the ones that actually provide in-depth knowledge. For me, I found statquest, 3blue1brown, half of freecodecamp, ritvik math,,, you will eventually figure these out on your own.

Tldr: People get into all sorts of biases (anchoring, selective, conformity, halo, dunning-kruger...). Best is to search them by yourself.

**“How did you get into your internships 😅 getting into a fortune 50 company is so impressive.”**

Apart from that gentle flex, they were the first to visit our campus and I was fully prepared. If you have:

1. A resume that outshines
2. In-depth knowledge about your subject
3. Basic DSA skills, you can crack any interview as a fresher.

I will cover these points in the following sections.

**“Can you share your resume template?”**

[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Dqd-cApPQexGsBckqX5JDq0OJ8cBquVwAXtqffwrsn4/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Dqd-cApPQexGsBckqX5JDq0OJ8cBquVwAXtqffwrsn4/edit)

No, it’s not mine, I did not make it.

**“How to make a good resume”**

Having unique projects is important as I discussed earlier. Interviewers LOVEEEEE to grill you on resume. So make sure you’re being honest and can yap on any nuance detail for hours.

If you look carefully I have written ‘*Swift, Go, Excel, SQL, Tableau, Power BI, REST, Kubernetes, CNN, RNN, LSTM, NumPy*’ in white text small font somewhere in my resume. This is just to pass ATS screens. I do not know swift and kubernetes and probably did only one project on tableau or power bi but its not technically a lie since its invisible!

Watch resume roast videos, I used to watch frying pan and striver. I think they will cover up everything else you need to know.

**Tldr**: honesty is the best policy here, optimize according to ATS, watch resume roast videos.

**“How to improve my skills”**

Everyone and their moms can make testicular cancer detection or todo lists these days but what separates a programmer from a coder is their core knowledge.

I will highly recommend you to go deeper into ML topics (Or whatever your specialisation is). Interviews usually go in great details so you should be knowing like not just why vanishing gradients happen in RNNs but the math behind it, how the backpropagation gradients multiply and diminish.

I would suggest you to take a pen and paper and **make notes** about everything in sequential order. That is how I can get anything fed into my memory. Otherwise you’re just doom watching yt videos and will eventually forget it all, lose motivation and now you're worse off than before.

You can really master any topic in detail in a few weeks if you give it enough time and patience!

**Tldr**: pick topics that you enjoy, go deeper, make detailed hand notes.

**“Can u recommend me the resources”**

A lot of people keep recommending me books about neural networks, altho I have never read any so I can’t say about that.

Nowadays there are sooo amazing youtubers who visualize everything and teach in comprehensive details so I can highly recommend those. I usually find coursera and udemy courses either dogshit or things I could have learned faster through yt. However, I personally found Andrew NG’s courses to be very enlightening.

I would also suggest you to keep up with the tech, follow YouTubers like Fireship, Theo, Primeagen, Harkikat (not endorsing), I think medium articles are very helpful at times, Hacker news and even Reddit. This is very important to build up that mindset as well, and trust me, these small little things will make you a 10x dev.

Do I even need to mention ChatGPT for studying?

**Tldr**: YouTube and will power is probably all you need!

**“I started DSA last month, can you recommend any resource?”**

For dsa, I have been told this multiple times and a living proof as well of the fact that if you master \~100 questions from neetcode or striver or love babbar's playlist you can pretty much crack any faang interview. I did neetcode, absolutely LOVE that guy.

**“Can you please share your learning journey with me regarding aiml? I am in severe need of guidance, about the path I should follow”**

Skipping my journey part cos its complicated and messy.

For you, if you wanna get into the aiml space I will recommend you to take two paths, either sequentially or simultaneously is upto you.

First is going deeper into the details of how these models work, the math behind every single model, and core knowledge of the field. I suggest everyone to make notes as you learn otherwise you will forget everything. YouTube is all you need, you need to be careful of picking youtubers tho, most of them are in just for money and offer no in depth knowledge.

Second path is making projects. You will pick basic beginners projects, follow YouTubers, advance only when you're comfortable with current project, and slowly head towards complex projects. You don't need as hi fi projects as i have, but you also don't want another breast cancer detection in your resume.

You have to complete both this stuff by the end of second year itself. Because in your gap before 3rd year you will need to grind leetcode all day and night cos companies gonna start coming from 5th sem. And the best companies come first.

With this you will have all the tools you need to crack any fresher interview in the world. Hope this helps!

**Tldr**: 2 pathways: theoretical and practical. Before starting third year you need to finish them AND DSA as well.

By the way as much as I have seen, apart from FAANG companies none have asked any hi-fi DSA questions at all. Mostly its just link list reversal, anagrams, OOPs and easy array/hashmap questions. I might be totally wrong though so correct me if you think otherwise, but I have given every OA in my college placements so far.

If you have any general questions please ask in comments, if you have specialized doubts do not hesitate to dm me! **I will be replying to rest of the DMs after Saturday** since I have something important coming up but I will make sure to respond to all of them.

One last tip I can give you is to help others. In India there's a VERY competitive culture and students think if they share their knowledge with others they will tramp over you. But in fact, there's all sorts of researches on this that if you study in group, teach, and help others, you benefit MORE than the other person. So keep your spirits high, and I really hope for your success!

Enough yapping from me, let me know what your takes below and please correct me if I am wrong somewhere."

1etoc3d,1,2024-08-16,From Struggles to Success: The Birth of Axon,u/Excellent_Breath_180,axonlearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/axonlearning/comments/1etoc3d/from_struggles_to_success_the_birth_of_axon/,"Our story begins with our founder and CEO facing one of the toughest challenges in his medical school journey. After failing two SHELF exams, he was advised to take a year off to focus on preparing for the USMLE Step 1. It was a time filled with uncertainty, stress, and a relentless drive to overcome the odds.

During this period, something extraordinary happened. Chat-GPT 3.0, the first widely adopted Large Language Model (LLM), burst onto the scene, making headlines for its groundbreaking capabilities. Our CEO, curious about its potential, began experimenting with the LLM by inputting board exam questions. What started as a simple experiment quickly turned into a revelation.

Not only could ChatGPT answer the questions accurately, but it also provided explanations that were clearer and more concise than anything he had encountered from traditional medical school resources or professors. This was the moment of realization: AI had the power to transform medical education, making complex concepts more accessible and easier to understand.

Armed with this newfound tool, our CEO not only passed Step 1 and Step 2 on his first attempt but also saw the immense potential AI held for helping other medical students. He decided to take another leave of absence—not out of necessity this time, but out of passion—to bring Axon to life.

At Axon, our mission is clear: to provide medical students with an affordable, high-tech resource that supports them through one of the most stressful periods of their lives. We understand the challenges because we’ve lived them. And now, we’re dedicated to making sure that no student has to face them alone.

Join us as we continue to develop and refine a platform that’s not just about passing exams, but about mastering the knowledge and skills that will shape the future of medicine."

I'm not dead set on this project idea but I thought it would be simple enough to complete.

What course Coursera should I take? I asked chatgpt and it said that machine learning Andrew ng was a good start. 

I can make a different project to apply machine learning by Andrew ng or choose a different course to fit my project."
1etom41,1,2024-08-16,Behind the Scenes at Axon: Redefining AI in Medical Education,u/Excellent_Breath_180,axonlearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/axonlearning/comments/1etom41/behind_the_scenes_at_axon_redefining_ai_in/,"At Axon, we believe that the true power of AI in education has yet to be fully realized. Too often, we see AI applications that are lazily implemented—just thrown into the mix without fully capturing the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). In medical education, where the stakes are incredibly high, this approach simply isn't good enough.

One common shortfall we noticed with most AI-powered chatbots is that they simply provide answers to users’ questions. While this might seem helpful, it often puts the user in a passive mode of thinking, similar to reading a textbook. In medical school, however, passive learning doesn’t cut it. Students need to be engaged actively to truly grasp and retain complex medical concepts.

That’s why we took a different approach at Axon. Our chatbot isn’t just about spitting out answers; it’s designed to walk users through complex medical topics using the Socratic Method. This method doesn’t just provide information—it engages the student in a dialogue, asking questions that lead them to think critically and arrive at conclusions themselves. This active engagement is crucial for deep understanding and long-term retention, especially when preparing for board exams.

Another advantage of our approach is that by leveraging LLMs, we’ve been able to keep our development costs low. This means we can offer our platform at a significant cost reduction compared to other resources on the market. We’re committed to making high-quality, AI-driven medical education accessible to all students, not just those who can afford expensive resources.

Our platform is currently in Beta testing, and we’re excited to offer 6 months of free access—no credit card required—to encourage students to engage with this revolutionary tool. We believe that once you experience the difference of learning with Axon, you’ll never want to go back to passive studying.

Join us as we continue to push the boundaries of what AI can do in medical education and make a real difference in how students learn and succeed."

1etxyy8,18,2024-08-16,Nvidia AI Released Llama-Minitron 3.1 4B: A New Language Model Built by Pruning and Distilling Llama 3.1 8B,u/ai-lover,machinelearningnews,https://www.reddit.com/r/machinelearningnews/comments/1etxyy8/nvidia_ai_released_llamaminitron_31_4b_a_new/,"The Llama-3.1-Minitron 4B model is the distilled and pruned version of the bigger Llama-3.1 8B sister model. To create this smaller model from the original 8B model, Nvidia used structured pruning in the depth and width directions. Pruning is a technique that deletes less important layers or neurons of the network to reduce model size and complexity while retaining its performance. In this case, Nvidia performed the depth pruning by removing 16 layers from the model and downsizing it from an 8B to a 4B model. Another technique applied is width pruning through trimming embedding dimensions and MLP intermediate.

Besides pruning, Nvidia also applied classical distillation to enhance the efficiency of Llama-3.1-Minitron 4B. Knowledge distillation is a process whereby a smaller model, the student, is trained to mimic the behavior of a larger and more complex one, the teacher. In this way, much of the predictive power of the original model is preserved in the smaller model, but it is faster and more frugal in terms of resources. Nvidia has combined this with the distillation technique and pruning, making sure that the retrained model of 4B is high-performing and is well-spent in larger models....

Do you agree? 

Nowadays people highly depend on computers in many spheres of daily life and writing is not an exception. We make notes, chat with friends and colleagues, and write e-mails by typing on a phone or computer. I agree that using a computer keyboard instead of a pen and a piece paper can make people partly loose such skills, as handwriting, grammar and spelling, but I don't believe that they will be forgotten completely. 

On the one hand, many computer programs have autocorrection functions, which means a writer no longer needs to worry about orthographical mistakes. For instance,  Microsoft Word outlines spelling and grammar mistakes and suggests to correct it. Not to mention apps, like Grammarly and ChatGPT, providing an option of paraphrasing your text and make it more consice and efficient. Typing on a smartphone is even easier, because of a predictive text technology T9, which analyses frequently used word combinations and allows you just to choose a word you need by simply tapping, instead of writing it. Although these engines are indeed helpful, they make people think less about how they write. Unfortunately, the human brain works the way, that it makes us forget skills we do not use for a long time, as it considers them useless. According to my own experience, I noticed that since I finished school and stopped writing by hand regularly, my handwriting got worse and I often don't remember how to spell some words correctly. 

On the other hand, learning how to write, spell and use grammar constructions is a part of school education. Children learn these skills from a young age and practice them during the whole period of studying. If schools would continue to encourage young people to write by hand, the future of writing will be secure. Moreover, even in universities some professors specifically ask students to write assignments on paper to check how they will manage without a computer. Furthermore, in Japan having a neat and accurate handwriting is considered an anwantage when candidate applies for a job, that is why some companies require a hand written resume. All these facts show that society still understands the importance of ability to write without using a computer, so hand writing will not be dead in future. 

Overall, even though modern people write much less and often rely on computer tools, when it comes to grammar and spelling, being able to write by hand  is still socially considered a valuable skill and I am sure that it will not be forgotten in the near future."
1eua4p7,3,2024-08-17,Math SAT scores may be doing worse than we had thought?,u/Significant-Notice-,marginal,https://www.reddit.com/r/marginal/comments/1eua4p7/math_sat_scores_may_be_doing_worse_than_we_had/,"Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) is crucial for college admissions but its effectiveness and relevance are increasingly questioned. This paper enhances Synthetic Control methods by introducing Transformed Control, a novel method that employs Large Language Models (LLMs) powered by Artificial Intelligence to generate control groups. We utilize OpenAI’s API to generate a control group where GPT-4, or ChatGPT, takes multiple SATs annually from 2008 to 2023. This control group helps analyze shifts in SAT math difficulty over time, starting from the baseline year of 2008. Using parallel trends, we calculate the Average Difference in Scores (ADS) to assess changes in high school students’ math performance. Our results indicate a significant decrease in the difficulty of the SAT math section over time, alongside a decline in students’ math performance. The analysis shows a 71-point drop in the rigor of SAT math from 2008 to 2023, with student performance decreasing by 36 points, resulting in a 107-point total divergence in average student math performance. We investigate possible mechanisms for this decline in math proficiency, such as changing university selection criteria, increased screen time, grade inflation, and worsening adolescent mental health. Disparities among demographic groups show a 104-point drop for White students, 84 points for Black students, and 53 points for Asian students. Male students saw a 117-point reduction, while female students had a 100-point decrease. This research highlights the need to reconsider the SAT’s role in admissions and to update educational strategies to enhance high school math performance.

I have already started working on this project for a while in my home country and now I feel like Singapore is the right market for it. However, I need a local student as a co-founder to sort of guide me through this transition, teach me the ins and outs of business here.  

The project is related to AI, more specifically Large Language Models. However, it is not limited to it. Wether you’re familiar with AI or not, it does not really matter as the technical aspect of it is not a problem. Rather, what matters is a deep entrepreneur spirit and a good sense of what the Singaporean market needs.

Also, note that there are several entrepreneurship-related scholarships we could apply to along the way, but we have to act quick as many deadlines are approaching.

1euemzu,1,2024-08-17,RK Info Systems: A Student's Nightmare Run by Vivek Parmar,u/Nice-Tale-8925,u_Nice-Tale-8925,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Nice-Tale-8925/comments/1euemzu/rk_info_systems_a_students_nightmare_run_by_vivek/,"
There is a company named ""RK Info Systems"" operated by just one person, Mr. Vivek Parmar. He is the CTO of RK Info Systems. Surprisingly, he is also the one who will interview you, conduct the HR interview, sign your offer letter, and help you join the company. Vivek will handle your employee induction, assign you an employee ID, and even teach your classes during the training period. 

Essentially, the entire company revolves around Mr. Vivek. Occasionally, if he is busy, Komal might handle your classes and assignments. However, she lacks technological knowledge and communicates with broken English, making it difficult to understand her. 

The company primarily assigns basic tasks and after one or two months, when you request your salary, they often make excuses like plagiarism, using ChatGPT, or low attendance. They might send escalation emails and eventually terminate your employment. If you are fortunate enough to keep your job, salary payments become irregular. After a couple of months, they might stop assigning tasks altogether. 

The sole purpose of RK Info Systems and Vivek Parmar seems to be defrauding students and ruining their futures. This entire scheme takes about five to six months, leaving students with no experience, salary, or knowledge, but plenty of stress and sleepless nights. Consequently, finding a new job as a fresher becomes challenging. 

Vivek Parmar is obsessed with hiring. His Twitter feed reflects this constant recruitment activity. The company's primary goal appears to be generating revenue from colleges and placement coordinators by conducting placement drives. They hire students and terminate them after a month or two.

Many students have fallen victim to RK Info Systems and Vivek Parmar. Unfortunately, Vivek Parmar deletes negative reviews about the company. 

My personal experience:

I studied at ABC College and participated in a Java bootcamp organized by Anu Foundation. During the placement drive, RK Info Systems was introduced as a company with former Anu Foundation students. We were compelled to interview with RK Info Systems as part of our college placement process. Surprisingly, the interview was conducted by only one person, Vivek Parmar, who was introduced as the CTO. After clearing basic Java questions and a coding round, a few of us were selected.

We received offer letters and due to college rules, couldn't participate in other placements. The training period was six months with a monthly stipend of around Rs. 28,000. The joining date was postponed multiple times. Eventually, we joined and were assigned tasks by Komal, who lacked technical expertise. After a month, salary issues arose with accusations of plagiarism and low attendance.

The placement coordinator from Anu Foundation promised legal action against RK Info Systems but nothing concrete happened. We suffered from stress, anxiety, and wasted six months without gaining any experience or knowledge. 

I urge students to stay away from RK Info Systems and Vivek Parmar to avoid falling victim to their fraudulent activities.

What are the options?,u/Maverick_ESL,IELTS_Guide,https://www.reddit.com/r/IELTS_Guide/comments/1ev2og4/how_can_you_have_your_writing_and_speaking/,"There have been so many questions about this on our main sub r/IELTS since there are so many different options on the internet. In this post, I want to go through some of them.

**AI-Based Instant feedback tools**

Instant feedback tools have been around for many years, but they got more popular after Chat GPT was introduced. There are now free and premium AI-based feedback tools, but the question is are they good enough for you to rely on? As a website designer and a DELTA-certified EFL teacher, I thought maybe I could design my own tool and put it on my site, but after a [**thorough analysis**](https://www.reddit.com/r/IELTS_Guide/comments/10v1iz9/can_you_rely_on_chatgpt_to_score_your_ielts/) of different AI, I realized they are not reliable yet, so I work closely with my students. IELTS is too expensive to invest in such tools. Plus, if AI was good enough, there wouldn't be a human examiner anymore. Just think about it! Don't risk your future! IELTS doesn't use AI now for a reason.

**Free human feedback here and there on the internet**

Some people offer free writing or speaking feedback on different corners of the internet. We used have have that kind of post in the main subreddit r/IELTS, but the sheer amount of inaccurate ratings and advice from random users made us discontinue those posts. Read the comment section of [**this post**](https://www.reddit.com/r/IELTS/comments/1eu97vp/is_it_no_longer_possible_to_ask_for_an_ielts/) for more details. A lot of people have started their free feedback communities or platforms, but is it really a true IELTS expert who is evaluating you or just someone (a student or an unqualified teacher) trying to do some experiments? Think about it, if someone is an experienced qualified teacher, would they have that much time doing free evaluations? Anyone can call themselves anything they want, but it's their relevant certificates (e.g. Cambridge CELTA or DELTA ""language"" teaching certificates) that prove they know what they are talking about.

**Real professional help**

So, we've now discussed instant feedback tools that have logic and accuracy problems because AI is not yet sentient, and we have unreliable free feedback from random people. IELTS is expensive. Do you think it makes sense to put your trust in such options? The most reliable solution is to find a person with the right qualifications. That person would obviously not be free to do ""free"" evaluations, as Chris from IELTS Advantage once said, examiners don't live on air. You can find such a teacher in your local area, on well-known IELTS prep sites, or in the options pinned to the main sub [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/IELTS/comments/1b0s5rx/ielts_writing_and_speaking_resources_and/). Don't risk your future!

While I can’t say if Claude has gotten worse, I can say it does what I expect. 

With the right expectations, you can still get your coding projects done.I’m a computer science student and have been using AI for coding since ChatGPT became popular. 

I only started using Claude a month ago for coding, so I decided to test on one of my assignments which are highly detailed and graded on how well specific criteria are met.

I set clear instructions for Claude to follow the assignment guidelines, avoid unnecessary creativity, and focus on getting the highest grade. The goal wasn’t to build a real app but to meet the grading criteria. 

I ended up with a 4k-line React app—a movie catalog using the TMDB API. Claude mostly stuck to the instructions, but I had to tweak them along the way.

The layout was basic until I asked Claude to create a better UI using Tailwind CSS, inspired by Netflix. After copy-pasting the code into VSCode, I was impressed. 

My expectations for design were low, but the result was a Netflix-like interface with carousels and all. There were a few broken routes, but they were easy to fix.The key lesson? ""Give me six hours to chop down a tree, and I’ll spend the first four sharpening the axe."" Preparation and clear instructions make all the difference.

When Claude gives me bad results, it’s often due to lazy instructions or unrealistic expectations. When I take the time to be clear and realistic, I’m often surprised by how well it performs.

So, has Claude gotten dumber? I’m not sure. But can I still code what I need with it? Absolutely.

I’d love to hear other experiences—let’s keep the discussion productive and focus on learning from each other. I’ve learned a lot from this sub, and I believe a positive, constructive conversation is key. "

Yet I try to live with this, I hate it. I tried cleansing my bedroom with burning sage and some other tricks as well and no help. Any recommendations on this or any interpretation is appreciated. Thank you for reading.

**Reality**: I'm 33 years old f, gemini. I was an unpopular dork in high school. I graduated as the best student and didn't have many friends. Most teachers liked me as I was a good student. One geometry teacher had a favorite student who had the same name as her. She wouldn't let me solve a problem on the black board so that I could get points, even if I was the only student whose hand would be raised for the problem. She was basically sabotaging my grade. Each semester they announced the best student and it was me. 

**Dream**: I keep having this dream for years now, where I'm still on my high school. I either miss the school bus and miss an exam, or be absent on an exam day which I forgot that there was an exam. Then I'm no longer the best student. In some versions of the dream I exceed the absenteeism limit and by so, have to retake the last year of high school. In some versions I lose an unimportant course's book and for some reason cannot take the exam. And then they announce another person's name as the best student."
1eviuij,1,2024-08-18,Gadget 1.0 (using llama3.1) #Meta #ChatGPT #Grok #OpenAI,u/idunnojustanotherguy,ArtificialInteligence,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1eviuij/gadget_10_using_llama31_meta_chatgpt_grok_openai/,"# Thesis on Gadget1.0: A Modular AI-Powered System for Multi-Modal Interactions

**Abstract:** Gadget1.0 is an AI-driven framework designed to facilitate multi-modal interactions between a user and an AI model. Built on top of the LLaMA 3.1 model, the system integrates various modules to manage inputs such as text, audio, screenshots, and camera images, while providing outputs like text, speech, and mouse/keyboard control. The program leverages Python’s extensive ecosystem, incorporating subprocesses, threading, and queue management to maintain smooth operations and prevent bottlenecks. This thesis outlines the architecture, functionality, and code excerpts of Gadget1.0, showcasing its potential to serve as a versatile tool for research, automation, and interactive AI applications.

**1. Introduction:** Gadget1.0 was conceptualized as a robust AI-powered system capable of handling complex tasks involving multiple input and output formats. Its architecture ensures seamless interaction between the AI and the user while maintaining responsiveness even under varying computational loads. The system’s design is modular, allowing for easy expansion and adaptation to new tasks and inputs. The integration of LLaMA 3.1 as the core AI model enables sophisticated natural language processing and decision-making capabilities.

**2. System Architecture:** The core of Gadget1.0 is its modular architecture, which is built around several key components:

* **LLaMA Model Integration:** The system initiates a subprocess to run the LLaMA model, enabling AI-driven interactions.
* **Input Handling:** The program processes various input formats such as audio, text, screenshots, and camera images.
* **Output Generation:** The AI model generates outputs in multiple formats, including text, spoken audio, and mouse/keyboard actions.
* **Queue Management:** A queue system ensures that inputs are processed in the order they are received, preventing bottlenecks and maintaining smooth operation.
* **Subprocesses and Threading:** The program employs subprocesses and threading to manage parallel tasks, ensuring that the GUI remains responsive while the AI processes inputs.

**3. Code Overview:** The following excerpts highlight the key features of Gadget1.0’s code:

**3.1. LLaMA Model Integration:**

    pythonCopy codedef start_llama_model(model_name):
        command = f""ollama run {model_name}""
        process = subprocess.Popen(command, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stdin=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE, shell=True)
        debug(""Llama model started successfully."")
        return process
    

This function initializes the LLaMA model as a subprocess, allowing it to run concurrently with other tasks.

**3.2. Queue Management and Processing:**

    pythonCopy codedef enqueue_prompt(prompt):
        global prompt_queue
        prompt_queue.put(prompt)
        debug(f""Prompt added to queue: {prompt}"")
    
    def process_queue():
        global prompt_queue
        while True:
            if not prompt_queue.empty():
                prompt = prompt_queue.get()
                response = interact_with_llama(llama_process, prompt)
                handle_ai_response(response)
            time.sleep(delta_time)
    

These functions manage the queue of prompts sent to the AI, ensuring that inputs are processed in sequence.

(This feature has been extended to the AIs responses as well and both queues are Sorted with dialogue taking top priority over action and data retrieval(Obviously the queues are on seperate threads as well))

**3.3. Input Handling:**

    pythonCopy codedef listen_to_microphone():
        global mic_muted
        if mic_muted:
            debug(""Microphone is muted."")
            return None
        recognizer = sr.Recognizer()
        with sr.Microphone() as source:
            debug(""Listening for audio..."")
            audio = recognizer.listen(source)
            try:
                text = recognizer.recognize_google(audio)
                debug(f""Recognized audio: {text}"")
                return text
            except sr.UnknownValueError:
                debug(""Could not understand the audio."")
                return None
            except sr.RequestError as e:
                debug(f""Error with the recognition service: {e}"")
                return None
    

This function captures audio from the microphone and converts it to text, allowing the AI to process spoken commands.

**3.4. Output Generation:**

    pythonCopy codedef handle_ai_response(response):
        parts = response.splitlines()
        for part in parts:
            if part.startswith(""Audio:""):
                audio = part.split("":"", 1)[1].strip().strip(""'"")
                speak_text(audio)
            elif part.startswith(""Text:""):
                text = part.split("":"", 1)[1].strip().strip(""'"")
                display_text(f""Llama: {text}"")
            elif part.startswith(""Mouse:""):
                mouse_params = part.split("":"", 1)[1].strip().split("","")
                move_mouse(int(mouse_params[0]), int(mouse_params[1]), mouse_params[2].strip())
            elif part.startswith(""Keyboard:""):
                keyboard_params = part.split("":"", 1)[1].strip().split("","")
                handle_keyboard_input(keyboard_params)
    

This function processes the AI’s response, which may include commands for text output, speech, or mouse/keyboard actions.

**3.5. Subprocesses and Threading:**

1evmkzu,64,2024-08-18,Deep dive into Chegg - A turnaround story or a company in freefall?,u/k_ristovski,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1evmkzu/deep_dive_into_chegg_a_turnaround_story_or_a/,"**1.0 Introduction**

Chegg ($CHGG) began as a textbook rental service, ***a*****iming to reduce the high costs of purchasing textbooks**. Over time, it evolved into a company that offers **a** **range of educational services and tools**.

The education system has plenty of flaws, creating demand for individuals and companies to assist in understanding a certain topic. There are plenty of amazing sources of knowledge, ranging from *Coursera* and *edX* to *Udacity* and even *YouTube*. However, they **do not offer a solution to the homework**, but rather an understanding of a certain topic.

This is where Chegg comes in. Its primary business is **selling students monthly subscriptions for homework help.** So, is Chegg a ***net positive*** for society?

**Although it can be used for learning, I’d argue that it is an organization that supports academic dishonesty and acts as a cheating database for homework.**

Some universities request data from Chegg to monitor their students and prevent cheating during exams. Chegg provides this information, including *activity timestamps, IP addresses,* and *email details*, which universities use to identify and suspend students involved in misconduct.



**2.0 The pandemic surge & the beginning of the end**

As expected, Chegg benefited from the pandemic, and the number of subscribers doubled between 2019 and 2021 (from 3.9 million to 7.8 million).

However, the beginning of the end has started, and it can be best illustrated through the following 5 points:



**2.1 The competitive landscape is significantly different**

Given the alternatives that exist today for solving homework problems, it is unlikely that the company will return to its growing days.

ChatGPT was introduced in November 2022, although the revenue decline already started in Q2-2022. Based on the last quarterly report (Q2-2024), the revenue is **declining at a rate of 10% per year.** Its revenue is down from $776m back in 2021, to $683m for the last twelve months (ending June 2024).

It is not only ChatGPT, there’s *Caktus AI, Jenni AI, Numerade, Photomath, Course Hero, and many more.*

Google Trends paints a great picture of how the demand for Chegg has changed in the last 5 years.

  
**2.2** **Being profitable is a challenge**

Except for the pandemic period, the company is struggling to find its way to operating profitability, despite the \~70% gross margin. If we add up the operating profit / (loss) of the last 7 years (*which includes the pandemic boost*), the company broke even.

With more competitors, lower demand, and decreasing revenue, it is difficult to make a case that Chegg is a company that will turn things around. It appears that Chegg’s best days are behind it, and the only way to survive longer - is by cutting costs.

Back in April, the company announced Nathan Schultz as the new CEO, and a restructuring plan was shared with the public. Part of the plan was reducing its global headcount by 23% which will lead to **$40-$50m** in savings as of 2025. This is a great decision when facing declining revenue. However, on its own, it is not enough to create long-term shareholder value. It is unclear how the management plans to reinvent the company with fewer employees.

  
**2.3 Poor capital allocation**

The previous management has a terrible record in capital allocation.

We can best illustrate that through the balance sheet of the company between the end of 2017, and June 2024:

||December 2017|June 2024|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Cash, short-term, and long-term investments|$229m|$605m|
|Debt|$0|$617m|
|Net cash|$229|-$11|
|Shares outstanding|110m|104m|

Despite generating \~$1.3 billion in operating cash flow in this period, the company’s net cash position has decreased by $240m.

So, where did this **\~$1.5 billion go to?**

1. Acquisitions - **$600 million** (Busuu, Mathway, Thinkful, StudyBlue, WriteLab, Math42)
2. Capex - **$550 million**
3. Share buybacks (net of issuance) - **$200 million**

In Q2-2024, the company reported **$481m in impairments** (mostly in goodwill) - meaning they significantly overpaid for the past acquisitions, especially Busuu *(acquired for $436m).*



**2.5** **Terrible reviews**

The reviews of the company have been terrible. (Source: Trustpilot)

Recently, there have been more accusations of customers with difficulties canceling their memberships or having been charged multiple times after they canceled the subscription. The revenue the company reported is likely somewhat inflated and will continue to decrease in the quarters to come.



**3.0 Valuation**

Based on the above analysis, Chegg is a company with decreasing revenue and a low chance of finding a way to grow and become profitable. With that in mind, the value of the company is its liquidation value (which **IS NOT** its book value).

Based on my estimates, its liquidation value is around \~$160m (not that far from its market cap of $212m). Therefore, I do think the market is not expecting it to be a turnaround story.

**Could the market be wrong?** Of course!

1. Given the competitive landscape and the 23% employee reduction, as mentioned above, I struggle to envision a path, where the company reinvents itself and increases the number of subscribers. However, there is always a chance that a miracle happens, despite this chance being very low. With the restructuring plan in place, at least the company can survive for many years to come.
2. The company could get acquired for its customer base. The typical acquisition premium is around 20%, so the 7.7 million subscribers would have an average price of \~**$33**. I do think acquisition is a more likely scenario than bankruptcy.

1evosdb,1,2024-08-18,What functions and funding of schools would be lost if the U.S. Department of Education were abolished?,u/coolbern,u_coolbern,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_coolbern/comments/1evosdb/what_functions_and_funding_of_schools_would_be/,"I asked this question to [ChatPT](https://chatgpt.com) I haven't checked out its accuracy, but it shows that the Republican plan to abolish USDoE would not only do great damage to the education of Americans, but deny us the tools to see the ensuing damage.  It would best be summarized as implementing the maxim: **Ignorance Is Strength.**   

Here's the response:

>Abolishing the U.S. Department of Education would have significant implications for the U.S. education system. Here are some of the key functions and sources of funding that could be affected:

>Federal Funding: The Department of Education provides substantial funding to public schools, including Title I funding for low-income schools, special education funding under IDEA (Individuals with Disabilities Education Act), and funding for other programs such as Pell Grants for college students. Without the Department, these funding streams would need to be replaced or redistributed by state or local governments.

>Standardization and Accountability: The Department oversees national standards for education and implements programs that measure school performance. This includes standardized testing, reporting requirements, and accountability systems like No Child Left Behind (NCLB) and the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA). The absence of these systems could lead to variability in educational quality and standards across states.

>Civil Rights Enforcement: The Department of Education enforces federal civil rights laws related to education. This includes ensuring that schools do not discriminate based on race, color, national origin, sex, disability, or age. Abolishing the Department could weaken protections for marginalized groups and reduce oversight of discriminatory practices.

>Higher Education Oversight: The Department regulates and provides oversight for higher education institutions, including accreditation, student loans, and financial aid. It administers federal student loan programs, including Direct Loans and the Federal Perkins Loan Program. Without the Department, there would be a gap in regulation and oversight of these loans, potentially affecting millions of students.

>Educational Research and Data Collection: The Department conducts and funds educational research, collects data on educational outcomes, and provides valuable information and analysis on the state of education in the U.S. The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) is part of this effort, and its absence could impact the availability of reliable educational data.

>Support for Specific Populations: The Department provides targeted support for various student populations, such as those with disabilities, English language learners, and students from low-income families. This includes specialized programs and resources that help address the unique needs of these groups.

>Policy Development and Guidance: The Department develops and disseminates educational policies and guidelines that help shape educational practices and ensure consistency across schools. It provides technical assistance and guidance to state and local education agencies.

>In summary, abolishing the Department of Education would likely lead to a significant restructuring of how education is funded and regulated in the U.S. It would shift many responsibilities to state and local governments or potentially private entities, which could lead to inconsistencies and gaps in educational quality, access, and equity."
1evpe15,4,2024-08-18,Advice on my writing ,u/Fosphor_,horrorwriters,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorwriters/comments/1evpe15/advice_on_my_writing/,"I have never wrote anything before and I really want to make a horror book. This is what I have so far. Any opinions are welcome but try to be nice about it.
 

  The bedroom creeped with sunlight as the morning dawned. The burgundy curtains as smooth as silk hang slightly open allowing sunlight to beam through. The entire house is crimson looking as if it was just painted. A deep green arm chair sits across from the king size bed that lays in the middle of the moderately sized bedroom. In the bed tucked under the covers sleeping is Michael. 
    He rises from bed and plants his feet on the cold hard wood floor. His house sits in the middle of nowhere off a back road surrounded by woods. The birds chirp from the window as he makes his way to the antique bathroom mirror to examine his complexion. His fair skin oily from the sweat filled nightmares that won’t go away. He strokes his short jet black pompadour hair. His green eyes complimenting the bags from the horrible sleep he’s had lately. 
    Michael makes his way to the closet trying to pick the best outfit for the day. A grey suit ironed just right and a multicolored tie with stripes. The perfect outfit for an art professor. He makes his way down the stairs to the open kitchen and living room. Cereal is on the menu for breakfast. While Michael eats he opens his laptop and finds the locked folder called “explicit art” inside are photos of mutilated bodies and victims of murder. Michael watches the images as if they moved. The blood rushing to his face indulging in ecstasy as his eyes gaze upon the mutilation. After eating his cereal Michael gets in his car grabbing his suitcase full of teaching materials. He drives a white sedan, a typical Inconspicuous vehicle nothing special. The inside is covered in light brown leather. The vehicle it self is really clean inside and out.
The drive to “Fine Arts of Wayne” is about 5 miles from the secluded home. 
     Michael arrives at the big brick college pulling into the staff parking lot. “Fine arts of Wayne” was constructed only 10 years ago. It’s a fairly new art school with high ranking. The school holds about 5,000 students. They offer on campus living and facilities like cafeteria, coffee shops, art stores, and a big open area for students to sell their art. 
    He steps out of the vehicle to be greeted “Michael! Welcome back!” A light blond woman approaches.
“Hey Francesca, how was your break? Did you do anything exciting?” 
“Oh just the usual staycation with the animals, you know how it is.” She chuckled.
Francesca has blue eyes translucent as sea glass. She wears stunning clothing with dresses being her favorite. Today she wears a red dress complemented with a yellow belt.
“My class starts in 5 I have to run, it was good seeing you Michael!” Francesca said while walking away. 
He can’t help but feel a pulse of need when she’s around. To look into her eyes and feel the pain of a blank canvas. To watch the red paint drip down her body, to puddle and immerse itself with what surrounds.
He needs to calm himself Michael thought. Soon he’ll engage but for now he needs to head to class. 
     The class was filled with about 70 students. Images of different art aras plaster the walls around the room. Pop art being the loudest image of them all. 
“Good morning class! I see most of you are here. That’s good! Let’s jump back into where we left off before spring break shall we.” Michael announced to the class.
He points to the young adult male sitting in the back row. 
“You. Tell me what was last discussed before break” 
The boy looks nervous to speak in front of so many people.
“We were learning about Impressionism sir.”
“Good, and what about Impressionism were we learning”
The young man looked even more nervous.
“If I remember correctly” he stammered “we were learning about the arguments of Impressionism and how Claude Monet is argued to be the last Impressionism artist dying in 1926.”
“Yes! That’s good!” Michael shouted 
The doors to the classroom quietly open and sunlight beams in. A young lady with red hair the color of cinnamon and auburn sneaks between the crack of the door. 
Michael can’t help but watch her entering. He can feel the tingling coursing through his veins. The urge to see what’s under her skin. 
“Why are you coming into my classroom during session, and not before session.” Michael demanded.
She turned bright red embarrassed from the disruption. 
“I’m sorry sir I’ve just transferred classes and this is my first time coming to this room so I got lo-“ Michael cuts her off
“Just sit down and see me after class. Take notes you’re going to need them if you want to catch up.”
“Yes sir” she replied while scurrying for a seat.


Chapter: 2
     After class the red haired young woman approached Michael as instructed.
“Excuse me sir you asked me to see you after class.” She said while fidgeting with her white shirt.
“Isn’t it a bit late to be transferring classes Miss.”
“Olivia is my name sir” 
“Well Olivia why don’t we get you a list of expected materials for this class” 
“Thank you sir” she bowed her head down
“Please stop with the formality, call me Michael.” 
“Sorry, Michael, can I ask how old you are? You seem young for a professor.” She said with a confused expression.
“Thank you for noticing” he chuckled “im currently 28 years of age now, i started college when I was 17 I graduated with a bachelor’s when I was 26 and have been a professor for Fine arts of Wayne for about 2 years now… and how about yourself?” Michael gestured towards Olivia.
“I’m 22 going for a degree in illustration, history of course is important for this degree.” She smiled
“Yes it is” Michael agreed
As their eyes meet Michael couldn’t help but feel a deep connection between them. He wants to hear her, feel her, experience her, and destroy her. 
“I expect you to have all the material by next week. If you need help getting caught up on homework find me and we can go over it.” He said calmly
“Thank you” she said as she walked away.
     Michael watches her until she leaves out the same door she entered. Soaking up her smell that she left hovering at his desk. 

Chapter 3
    He finds his way back to the parking lot after his morning classes are over. As he opens his door a woman approaches him. 
It’s Francesca.
“Sorry I had to go so fast this morning my students think that they can leave when the teacher doesn’t show.” 
They both smiled
“I was thinking Michael, maybe we could get some coffee soon and get to know each other more”
Michael couldn’t help but stair at her, examining her canvas. 
“I would enjoy that” he finally said
“Good, let’s meet at the campus coffee shop tomorrow before class.”
“I’ll meet you there around 6 o’clock then”
She grinned 
“Bye Michael I’ll see you tomorrow”
He could see a tent of red flush her cheeks.
Michael gets in his car and sighs deeply.
The craving to mutilate courses through his body. The temptation to take her right now in the parking lot, not caring who sees. His mind is getting the better of him, he’s lacking control of his temptations.
     Making his way home he sits in silence.
Alone with his thoughts. Tomorrow he decided, tomorrow he will skip towns and gather tools to leave no trace of purchase history when the police get involved. The last thing he wants is to go to prison. In prison he can’t find canvases, in prison he can’t make art. The temptation grew in his body as he made his way down the road. Michael arrives and enters his home quickly and pulls out his laptop. Immediately he opens the secret file to examine the mutilated corpses. He imagines himself there experiencing the art as it unfolds. He lusts at the idea of blood, the idea of torture"

The lab tutors and lecturers aren't going to teach you how to do every question due to lots of other students asking them for help, so most of the time you'll have to teach yourself how to do it. I'm not saying to never ask tutors or lecturers for help, but I'm saying most of the time you'll have to teach yourself how to code in python to pass compsci 101, and ChatGPT to super useful in doing that. Here's how I did it, whenever I'm stuck on a question or didn't understand something, I either ask the lecturers or tutors or use ChatGPT to give me the answers and explain to me what each part of the code means, then I code everything myself even if I were to copy the code written from ChatGPT (Don't copy/paste the code from ChatGPT onto the lab questions or else you won't learn and understand how to do it during the test), type it down yourself even if you were to copy it. That's how I got better at coding and understood almost everything"
1evw51k,1,2024-08-19,Why has Stackoverflow produced disaster of a website ?,u/H-S-Striker,learnpython,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/1evw51k/why_has_stackoverflow_produced_disaster_of_a/,"Since the invention of the ""Like Button,"" humanity in the cyber realm has plunged into a big dark hole. We all agree that most people in the community are ignorant about what is right when their benefits are insulted, and we all agree that there are more people without a life spreading their ideas on the internet than people with a purposeful life. Yet websites have agreed that the majority of viewers can decide if YOUR content is worthy or not. How? By the Like Button. And Stack Overflow had the worst idea of all where not only does a Like or Upvote elevate your answer, but it also elevates your total rank. And those with the highest scores, oh boy! Those are kings now. They set rules, close discussions, and edit anything they like—the archive of human knowledge of programming is now in their hands. Damn that website! And what can you do? You're a beginner, a student, a nobody. You should lower your head and enter the website.

 

Just imagine if this system of ranking was on Reddit. I see gooner4alltime with 300k likes, proudslutprincess with 100 million likes, and religionisbullsh1tter with 1.1 million likes deciding what other Redditors should put in their content.

 

Any account is a man's property. The website owner gave a space on his server to you for free or for money, but when he passes the deed of the house, he should not spy, he should not supervise, and he should not interfere. But most rules on the internet today are compromised for profit. You live in the 21st century? OK, but you can’t view any social media unless you agree to our terms of services. No technology for you unless you submit to our rules. Imagine if I put a lot of effort into producing an amazing animation on YouTube, and the first comment is: ""As a person who has level 3 cancer, I want to thank you for this video."" Man, I do not care! Go and produce your own video about your cancer and seek people’s sentiment on your account. The content producer should decide what comments or answers are kept or elevated, NOT STRANGERS WITH OPPOSITE OPINIONS. Would you let a man stay at your daughter's wedding if he starts talking bad about her? Of course not. What if many people Like to see him talk? Bigger no! What if some people who have attended 100,000 weddings before want to see him talk? I KICK OUT THOSE WEIRD WEDDING BROWSERS FIRST!!! What in the hell, man, really, what in the hell? I truly believe the internet has made us accustomed to losing our privacy as a habit by removing accounts’ walls instead of putting doors in them. Turning every account into old chat rooms. A chat room is the cyber form of real-world streets; you talk, another person talks, one swears, like that. But a post by an account, with an ID, with a history, that is an identity, your simulated identity on a website. Yes, you can make many accounts, but that does not mean you should not possess the right to own them! They might say, what about discoverability? If I have a purpose or interest in the internet, relevant words with good filters and great connection of followers with mutual interest can lead me to them. Personally, I don’t remember the last time Like Button suggestion helped me more than a cracking chuckle on the internet. I always find interesting material by checking on followers, and specific words. That is what most Reddit and YouTube first comments became: chuckle factory.

 

Stack Overflow automatically omits ""hello"" from any answer. Even ChatGPT says hello, and it is not even considered human. And those rulers give you a crude answer too: ""We don't have time to see your hellos!"" ... Damn busy boy, if you don't have time, don't come to the website at all. Let a user with 50 points and a year of experience answer some of the programming questions. I saw a user with 1.1 million reputations who worked at Microsoft answer a simple C# question once. Why are you even in the Hot section? Go build software, model an aircraft, answer a 10-year-old unanswered question. So greedy for attention and scores that they can’t see anything beyond hogging all the answers on that website. As expected, these kinds of people (not all programmers are like them).

 

And we can't do much; a great deal of programming archive knowledge is there, and until the day AI has excelled at learning programming logic better than humans, we, students of knowledge, should visit there. Thank God that day is near!"

1evx402,7,2024-08-19,Considering switching to legal career from ESL career (42y/o),u/Content-Track9824,uklaw,https://www.reddit.com/r/uklaw/comments/1evx402/considering_switching_to_legal_career_from_esl/,"Hi everyone,

I’m a 42y/o Brit, living and working in South Korea as an ESL (English for speakers of other languages) teacher since 2008. I'm currently employed as an assistant professor (basically just an English teacher) at a university here in Korea. The ESL field is at a point where I might be might redundant soon due to the shrinking numbers of students at Korean unis (birthrate of 0.72 in 2023, and fewer people choosing uni). I’m at a stage in life and my career where I feel I need to switch things up, as I’m much too young to just coast through the remainder of my working life but much too old to chill for 5-10 more years. A lot of unis in Korea are closing or merging and I feel that it’s unrealistic to expect to still have this job (or a similar one) even a few years down the line. I’m thinking about my next step and I’ve been researching a career in law, but would really appreciate any realistic, honest (and brutal is also fine) advice from the excellent, knowledgeable community here. 

My current job is only ever on one year contracts, so there isn’t much job security. I’ve always been renewed in the past, but the number of people doing my job at my uni is gradually going down, and they haven’t recruited anyone new since 2018. Also no pay rises in the whole time I’ve worked here. Cost of living in Korea is still pretty reasonable for essentials, and I can comfortably save GBP1,000-1,500 per month here, but that’s only by living a pretty simple life with no major expenses. I’d like to start a family soon with my Korean partner and I’ll definitely need to be making more money eventually. However I have a reasonable chunk of savings and no urgency to make decent money for a number of years. I could probably find another ESL job in another country, but I feel the same problems will still be there wherever I go. 

Why am I considering law? Money isn’t the main reason. It’s more about feeling fulfilled and also stable, career-wise. I don’t feel intellectually stimulated or challenged at all in my uni teaching role. Honestly, a smart secondary school kid could handle a lot of the work I have to do. In many ways it is an *unbelievably* nice job in terms of perks (22 WEEKS paid vacation, only 10 hours per week in class the rest of the time), but I also feel like I’m not doing as much with my brain/life as I could be.

I don’t have a law background at all but I’m considering a postgraduate diploma online next year. Maybe Uni of Law… I have read so many awful things about them here but I would prefer to do my initial studies online if I can continue working and earning here in Korea for another year or two. I have a reasonably good academic background with a bachelor’s and master’s, both from Russell Group unis:

* BSc (hons) Zoology (2.1) - Uni of Southampton 
* MA TESOL (merit) - Uni of Nottingham

I’m good at learning complicated things and I love to work and study hard, despite my easy day job. For the last seven years I’ve been running a business on the side with my partner, teaching English online, and this has involved a lot of hard work and I’ve had to learn a lot of different things like programming, web dev, marketing, customer service, basic tax and accounting, all sorts. This has provided a modest extra income but has suffered since the arrival in Korea firstly of Grammarly and later of ChatGPT. Most people would rather a free AI service which is 80-90% accurate than a human service that you have to pay for. I’ve definitely experienced both edges of the AI sword (and as an aside I wonder if similar things will happen to the legal profession?)

I would consider permanently returning to the UK with my Korean soon-to-be-wife (who has experience of living in the UK) in a year or two if I felt that I could start a career in law. I don’t have any preference at this stage about training as a solicitor or barrister or whatever else, really. I have read that online legal jobs are basically non-existent, certainly for someone with zero experience and who lives overseas, so I understand I would need to go home to the UK rather than staying in Korea (in all honestly I would rather stay in Korea but I can't just do nothing with my time). There are other options I could explore in Korea, like trying to do a PhD and get a job as a researcher/professor, but that is risky due to the problems unis are having staying afloat. 

I might be foolish to even be considering trying to get into law, either due to competition, my age, or how hard it really is on a daily basis. But I am kind of unsure at this point. 

I guess what I’m asking is:

1. Do you think it’s a realistic prospect for me to start a career in law given my background and age?
2. If you were in my shoes would you try to start a career in law or go in a different direction?

I really appreciate any opinions you might have. I feel I’m at a crossroads in the middle of my life and I want to make the right choices. 

**TLDR**: 42y/o non-law-background Brit teaching ESL at a university in South Korea, but job is unstable and unfulfilling. Thinking of changing career to law in the UK but not sure if it’s realistic or even a good choice.

Many thanks."

I admit that I use ChatGPT in this way, but for little stuff like greeting cards or invitations.

1ew0853,1,2024-08-19,Idea for a language learning app - looking for feedback,u/Ill-Music5400,languagelearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/1ew0853/idea_for_a_language_learning_app_looking_for/,"TLDR: A daily AI language tutor - A very focused version of chat GPT that gives you specific information on a topic and then you interact with it about that topic to practice some key words. 

Hi all, I am a former language teacher and language learner and as a learner the biggest problem that I have is learning vocabulary. Of course I learn it but I do not use it enough and then forget it. 

When I was a teacher I put together worksheets for my students who wanted to expand vocabulary - they were based on popular news articles and we would highlight some key vocabulary for the student to practice - for example 

**Article -** 5 Steps to Effective Problem Solving  
**Key Vocabulary** -  to manage,  to discuss**,**  to come up with**,** to evaluate, to estimate, evaluation**,** to recognize**,** to identify, to examine, to determine, define etc.

**Talking points**

1. Identify the problem 
2. Break the problem down
3. Generate potential solutions

  
My idea would be to turn this into a chatbot like ChatGPT that work in the following way

* every day there can be a new lesson
* the chatbot will tell you the topic of the day and the key vocabulary that you are learning / practicing. 
* the chatbot would give you some information about the topic using the key vocabulary
* the chatbot would then ask you some simple questions on each of the talking points where you are expected to use the key vocabulary in the response e.g ""How do you identify problems at work""
* goal is for the student to use all the key vocab, ideally more than once in the responses.

I have a few hundred of these worksheets I can turn into lesson and completing them all would give you all of the vocabulary needed to speak at a good B1 level. 

Some additions to the basic idea would be

* student recording an audio of their responses and posting it in a Telegram/Whatsapp group etc for accountability
* Hard mode - once the student has taken the lesson once they can take the lesson again but the bot will only give them the key vocabulary in their native language. 

  
Obviously there are lots of ways to improve but they key idea is a daily tutor that lets you learn and practice a wide spread of vocabulary - would love to hear your thoughts."
1ew1lwp,1,2024-08-19,A Step-by-Step Guide for Teachers: Using ChatGPT to Help Students Create Novel Innovations,u/DefundBank,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1ew1lwp/a_stepbystep_guide_for_teachers_using_chatgpt_to/,"Here’s a refined guide with more examples specifically focused on helping students create and refine a claim of novelty as they develop their AI-powered solution using ChatGPT. This section will guide students through identifying what makes their idea unique and improving it.

---

### Step-by-Step Guide for Creating and Refining a Claim of Novelty Using ChatGPT

---

### 1. **Brainstorm Everyday Problems**

**Instruction**: Have students think of common problems they encounter in their daily lives, at school, or in the community. Once they have a list, encourage them to think about how they could use ChatGPT to create something unique to solve these problems.

**Example 1**:  
- **Problem**: “I struggle with organizing my assignments and managing deadlines.”
  - **Possible Solution**: “Create a personalized AI homework planner that not only tracks assignments but also adapts to each student’s unique schedule and study habits.”

**Claim of Novelty**: “This AI planner is different because it adapts to each user’s personal study habits, something generic calendar apps don’t do.”

**Example 2**:  
- **Problem**: “I often get overwhelmed trying to find good sources for research papers.”
  - **Possible Solution**: “Develop an AI research assistant that filters out unreliable sources and provides summaries of trusted academic papers.”

**Claim of Novelty**: “Unlike search engines, this AI assistant focuses only on academic sources and delivers easy-to-read summaries, saving students time.”

---

### 2. **Narrow Down Ideas**

**Instruction**: Encourage students to pick one problem that stands out to them and create a rough claim of novelty. Ask them to focus on why their solution would be different or better than existing options.

**Guiding Statement for Teacher**:  
- “Think about what makes your idea stand out. Why would people choose your AI tool over something else? What makes it new or different?”

**Prompts to Use with ChatGPT**:  
- “ChatGPT, how can I refine my idea to make it different from existing solutions?”  
- “What makes a product or service truly unique in today’s market?”  
- “How can I describe what’s unique about my AI tool?”

  - **Claim of Novelty**: “This planner isn’t just a calendar—it learns the user’s study habits and sends personalized reminders based on their productivity patterns.”

**Example 2**:  
- **Initial Idea**: AI research assistant  
  - **Claim of Novelty**: “Unlike regular search engines, this AI tool filters out unreliable sources and provides summaries, helping students quickly find trustworthy information.”

---

### 3. **Create and Refine the Claim of Novelty**

**Instruction**: Ask students to develop a clear “claim of novelty” for their AI solution—something that states how their idea is different from existing options. Then, guide them to use ChatGPT to refine this claim.

**Guiding Statement for Teacher**:  
- “Let’s focus on what makes your solution unique. Write down why your AI tool would be better or different from anything else out there. Then, we’ll use ChatGPT to help improve that claim.”

**Prompts to Use with ChatGPT**:  
- “ChatGPT, how can I make my idea for a homework planner sound more unique?”  
- “What are some ways I can improve my claim of novelty for my AI research assistant?”  
- “How can I make my idea stand out in a crowded market of educational tools?”

**Example 1 (Homework Planner)**:  
- **Initial Claim of Novelty**: “It’s a planner that adapts to study habits.”  
  - **Refined Claim of Novelty (after using ChatGPT)**: “This AI homework planner uses machine learning to analyze a student’s study patterns and sends tailored reminders when they are most likely to complete tasks, unlike traditional calendar apps that send generic alerts.”

**Example 2 (Research Assistant)**:  
- **Initial Claim of Novelty**: “It filters out bad sources.”  
  - **Refined Claim of Novelty (after using ChatGPT)**: “Our AI research assistant goes beyond simple search engines by exclusively curating trustworthy academic sources and offering concise summaries, making it easier for students to gather reliable information quickly.”

---

### 4. **Test the Idea with Feedback and Improve the Claim of Novelty**

**Instruction**: Once students have developed their claim of novelty, guide them to get feedback from their peers or family, then refine their claim further based on that feedback.

**Guiding Statement for Teacher**:  
- “Now that you have a claim of novelty, ask your friends or family if it sounds unique. Does it make your solution sound appealing? Let’s improve it based on their input.”

**Prompts to Use with ChatGPT**:  
- “ChatGPT, how can I improve my claim of novelty based on feedback?”  
- “What questions should I ask people to evaluate if they think my idea is unique?”  
- “How can I revise my idea to make it stand out more?”

**Example 1 (Homework Planner)**:  
- **Feedback**: “The planner sounds good, but how does it adapt to different types of students?”  
  - **Refined Claim of Novelty**: “Our AI homework planner doesn’t just track assignments—it learns each student’s preferred study times, adapts to their work style, and even suggests optimal break schedules for better productivity.”

**Example 2 (Research Assistant)**:  
- **Feedback**: “It sounds cool, but I don’t get how it saves me time.”  
  - **Refined Claim of Novelty**: “Our AI research assistant simplifies the research process by instantly curating reliable sources and summarizing them into easy-to-understand key points, saving hours of manual searching.”

---

### 5. **Continue Refining with ChatGPT’s Help**

**Instruction**: Guide students to use ChatGPT for ongoing refinement of their idea and claim of novelty. They can continue to ask ChatGPT to improve the phrasing, identify potential challenges, or suggest additional features.

**Guiding Statement for Teacher**:  
- “Use ChatGPT to keep improving your idea. Ask for feedback on how to phrase your claim of novelty better or how to address any challenges in making your solution unique.”

**Prompts to Use with ChatGPT**:  
- “ChatGPT, how can I make my claim of novelty sound more compelling?”  
- “What challenges might I face when building my homework planner, and how can I overcome them?”  
- “What new features could I add to make my research assistant even more useful?”

**Example 1 (Homework Planner)**:  
- **Refining with ChatGPT**: “ChatGPT, how can I make the homework planner even more unique?”  
  - **Response**: “You could include a motivational feature that rewards students when they complete tasks on time.”

**Example 2 (Research Assistant)**:  
- **Refining with ChatGPT**: “ChatGPT, how can I make the research assistant stand out more?”  
  - **Response**: “You could integrate a citation generator that helps students format their sources in MLA or APA style automatically.”

Here’s what ChatGPT had to say:

TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD
1. Do Not Be Boastful​—Why?
(10 min.)

Manipulative Language

	•	Use of Religious Authority: The article cites biblical passages and interpretations to establish authority and discourage questioning. By framing the discussion in religious terms, it manipulates the reader into accepting the argument without critical examination.
	•	Moral Superiority: The article suggests that pride is not only displeasing to God but also aligns one with the Devil. This dichotomy manipulates the reader into feeling morally inferior if they do not conform to the article’s viewpoint.

Illogical Reasoning and Counterarguments

	•	Overgeneralization: The article suggests that all forms of pride are inherently bad, equating it with sin and even aligning it with the Devil. This ignores the idea that pride can also be a source of motivation and self-respect.
	•	Appeal to Authority: The article relies heavily on biblical authority to make its points. A skeptic might argue that this is an appeal to a specific belief system that may not be universally applicable.
	•	Slippery Slope: The suggestion that even loyal servants of God can be overtaken by pride and fall from grace implies that any small act of pride will inevitably lead to one’s downfall. This is an oversimplified view of human behavior.

Logical Fallacies and Oversimplified Analogies

	•	Hasty Generalization: The article implies that because some biblical figures succumbed to pride, all people are at risk of the same fate. This is a hasty generalization that does not consider individual differences and circumstances.
	•	False Dichotomy: By presenting pride as a characteristic of the Devil, the article sets up a false dichotomy where one is either humble and godly or prideful and devilish, with no room for a balanced middle ground.
	•	Oversimplification: The analogy of pride being like a “horn” that should not be exalted oversimplifies the complex nature of self-esteem and self-worth, reducing them to mere arrogance.

Weasel Words and Phrases

	•	“Even faithful ones”: This phrase subtly implies that pride is an insidious trait that can affect anyone, no matter how devout, thereby creating a sense of fear and urgency.
	•	“Infected with pride”: The word “infected” is used to liken pride to a disease, which manipulates the reader into seeing it as something dangerous and uncontrollable.
	•	“Undeserved gift”: This phrase reinforces the idea that individuals should not feel any sense of accomplishment or pride in their achievements, as they are “undeserved.”

Negative Effects on the Reader

	•	Guilt and Self-Doubt: The article’s emphasis on the dangers of pride can instill guilt in readers who may naturally feel proud of their achievements or abilities. This could lead to self-doubt and a diminished sense of self-worth.
	•	Suppression of Individuality: By equating pride with sin, the article encourages readers to suppress their individual accomplishments and self-expression, potentially leading to a loss of personal identity.
	•	Fear of Divine Punishment: The constant reminder that God detests pride and will humble the proud may create an unnecessary fear of divine retribution, leading to anxiety and a reluctance to pursue personal growth or leadership roles.

In summary, while the article aims to promote humility, it employs manipulative language, logical fallacies, and oversimplifications to persuade the reader. This can have negative psychological effects, including guilt, self-doubt, and fear, which can stifle personal growth and expression.

2. Spiritual Gems
(10 min.)
Ps 76:10​—How can “the rage of man” praise Jehovah? (w06 7/15 11 ¶3)

Manipulative Language

	•	Spiritual Rationalization of Suffering: The article suggests that suffering is divinely permitted for the purpose of discipline and spiritual training. This can manipulate readers into accepting suffering without questioning it or seeking relief, as it is framed as part of God’s plan.
	•	Moral Obligation: By stating that suffering faithfully can lead others to glorify God, the article places a moral burden on believers to endure hardship without complaint, implying that their endurance could influence the faith of others.

Illogical Reasoning and Counterarguments

	•	Appeal to Divine Purpose: The argument that suffering is allowed by God for a higher purpose (discipline and training) assumes that all suffering has a divine reason behind it. A skeptic might argue that suffering often occurs due to natural or human causes and does not necessarily have a higher purpose.
	•	Post Hoc Reasoning: The article implies that because suffering can lead to a positive outcome (glorifying God), it must have been divinely intended. This is a post hoc fallacy, assuming that because one event follows another, the first must be the cause of the second.
	•	Overemphasis on Endurance: The idea that suffering faithfully will lead others to glorify God may not hold true in all cases. Skeptics might argue that witnessing suffering can just as easily lead to doubt or rejection of faith, rather than strengthening it.

Logical Fallacies and Oversimplified Analogies

	•	Circular Reasoning: The article uses circular reasoning by stating that suffering is permitted by God to discipline believers and that this discipline leads to glorifying God. The reasoning is circular because it assumes the premise (that suffering is for discipline) in order to prove the conclusion (that suffering glorifies God).
	•	False Cause: The assumption that suffering necessarily leads to spiritual growth or glorification of God is a false cause fallacy. Not all suffering leads to positive outcomes, and this oversimplifies the complex nature of human experiences and responses to suffering.
	•	Oversimplification of Suffering: By framing all suffering as a form of divine discipline, the article oversimplifies the varied causes and effects of suffering in human life, reducing it to a single religious interpretation.

Weasel Words and Phrases

	•	“Permits suffering”: The word “permits” is used to suggest that God is allowing suffering rather than causing it directly. This weasel word subtly shifts responsibility away from God while still implying divine control.
	•	“Training” and “Discipline”: These words are used to frame suffering in a positive light, suggesting that it is for the benefit of the believer, even though the actual experience may be harmful or distressing.
	•	“To the extent that it provides such training”: This phrase is vague and non-committal, leaving open the interpretation of how much suffering is necessary, which can manipulate readers into accepting varying degrees of hardship without question.

Negative Effects on the Reader

	•	Acceptance of Suffering: By framing suffering as a form of divine discipline, the article can lead readers to passively accept hardship in their lives without seeking solutions or questioning the circumstances, which may perpetuate cycles of suffering.
	•	Guilt and Shame: The idea that enduring suffering faithfully can lead others to glorify God may place an undue burden on believers, leading to feelings of guilt or shame if they struggle with their hardships or fail to endure them “faithfully.”
	•	Suppression of Emotions: The article’s emphasis on viewing suffering as a positive, disciplinary experience can discourage individuals from expressing or even acknowledging their pain and distress, leading to emotional repression and psychological harm.
	•	Risk of Exploitation: Believers who internalize the message that suffering is divinely sanctioned may be more vulnerable to exploitation or abuse, as they might be less likely to challenge unjust or harmful situations, believing them to be part of God’s plan.

In conclusion, while the article seeks to provide a religious interpretation of suffering, it employs manipulative language and logical fallacies to justify hardship as divinely ordained. This can have negative psychological and emotional effects on readers, including acceptance of suffering without question, guilt, and emotional suppression.

Problematic passages in Psalms 75-77

Psalms 75-77, like many other psalms, explore themes of divine justice, judgment, and deliverance. These psalms contain some passages that skeptics might critique, particularly regarding their theological implications, the portrayal of divine justice, and the problem of suffering. Let’s examine potential concerns for each of these psalms.

Psalm 75

Psalm 75 is a psalm of thanksgiving and praise, celebrating God’s justice and His role as the judge of the earth. Potential problematic passages include:

	1.	Divine Judgment (Verses 2-8): The psalm emphasizes that God will judge the wicked and exalt the righteous. In particular, verse 8 speaks of God pouring out a cup of wrath:
	•	Verse 8: “In the hand of the Lord is a cup full of foaming wine mixed with spices; he pours it out, and all the wicked of the earth drink it down to its very dregs.”
	•	Skeptics might find the imagery of divine wrath and punishment troubling, questioning the morality of a deity who punishes so severely.
	2.	Exaltation of the Righteous (Verses 6-7): The psalm declares that promotion and exaltation come from God alone:
	•	Verses 6-7: “No one from the east or the west or from the desert can exalt themselves. It is God who judges: He brings one down, he exalts another.”
	•	Critics might challenge the fairness of a system where divine favor is the sole determinant of success or failure, seeing it as potentially arbitrary or unjust.

Psalm 76

Psalm 76 is a song of triumph, celebrating God’s victory over Israel’s enemies. Potential problematic passages include:

	1.	God as a Warrior (Verses 3-6): The psalm portrays God as a powerful warrior who breaks the weapons of the enemy and brings down the proud:
	•	Verses 6: “At your rebuke, God of Jacob, both horse and chariot lie still.”
	•	Skeptics might find the depiction of God as a warrior problematic, especially in the context of divine violence and the destruction of enemies.
	2.	Fear and Awe (Verses 7-9): The psalm describes the fear and awe that God inspires when He rises to judge:
	•	Verse 7: “It is you alone who are to be feared. Who can stand before you when you are angry?”
	•	Critics might question the emphasis on fear as a response to God, arguing that it portrays a deity who rules through intimidation rather than love.
	3.	Divine Retribution (Verse 10): The idea that human wrath ultimately serves to praise God might be troubling to some:
	•	Verse 10: “Surely your wrath against mankind brings you praise, and the survivors of your wrath are restrained.”
	•	This could be seen as suggesting that even human anger and conflict are part of a divine plan, which raises questions about free will and the nature of God’s justice.

Psalm 77

Psalm 77 is a psalm of lament and reflection, moving from despair to a remembrance of God’s mighty deeds in the past. Potential problematic passages include:

	1.	Questioning God’s Faithfulness (Verses 7-9): The psalmist expresses deep doubt and despair, questioning whether God has abandoned His people:
	•	Verses 7-9: “Will the Lord reject forever? Will he never show his favor again? Has his unfailing love vanished forever? Has his promise failed for all time? Has God forgotten to be merciful? Has he in anger withheld his compassion?”
	•	Skeptics might point to these verses as evidence of the inconsistency or unreliability of divine promises, or as reflecting the psalmist’s deep existential crisis.
	2.	Theodicy and Suffering (Verse 2): The psalmist describes crying out to God in the day of trouble, with no immediate answer:
	•	Verse 2: “When I was in distress, I sought the Lord; at night I stretched out untiring hands, and I would not be comforted.”
	•	Critics might view this as highlighting the problem of unanswered prayers and the apparent silence of God in the face of human suffering.

General Skeptical Concerns

	•	Divine Justice and Wrath: Across these psalms, the themes of divine judgment, wrath, and the exaltation of the righteous are prominent. Skeptics might argue that these portrayals raise moral and ethical concerns about the nature of God, especially in terms of punishment and the use of power.
	•	Fear as a Motivator: The emphasis on fear of God as a response to His power and judgment could be seen as promoting a relationship based on fear rather than love or trust.
	•	The Problem of Suffering: In Psalm 77, the psalmist’s struggle with despair and the sense of abandonment could be used by skeptics to question the goodness and reliability of God, especially when people experience intense suffering or feel that their prayers go unanswered.

Overall, while Psalms 75-77 express deep faith and confidence in God’s justice and power, they also present themes that skeptics might critique, particularly regarding divine judgment, the nature of God’s justice, and the problem of suffering.

Summary and Analysis 

Manipulative Language

	•	Guiding Responses: The article advises using questions to “help” the student arrive at the desired conclusion, rather than allowing them to form their own opinions. This is a subtle form of manipulation, where the teacher steers the conversation toward a pre-determined outcome.
	•	Assumptive Language: The article assumes that the Jehovah’s Witness interpretation of scripture is correct and that any conflicting viewpoints must be gently corrected. This presents their interpretation as the only valid one without considering alternative perspectives.

Illogical Reasoning and Counterarguments

	•	Selective Use of Scripture: The article selects specific Bible verses to support the argument that Jesus is not Almighty God, without addressing the broader context of other scriptures that some Christians use to argue the opposite. A skeptic might point out that this selective use of scripture is cherry-picking, ignoring other passages that could challenge this view.
	•	Loaded Questions: The questions posed (e.g., “Who is older and has more authority? A father or a son?”) are designed to lead the student to a specific conclusion. This type of reasoning assumes that the answer is self-evident, but it oversimplifies theological concepts that are deeply complex and debated among scholars.

Logical Fallacies and Oversimplified Analogies

	•	False Dilemma: The article presents a false dilemma in the comparison between Jehovah and Jesus, implying that the only possible relationship is one of superiority and subordination. This ignores the nuanced views held by many Christian denominations that see Jesus and God as part of the Trinity, a more complex relationship than what is presented.
	•	Begging the Question: The article’s instructions assume that the Bible’s teachings align perfectly with Jehovah’s Witness beliefs. This is a classic example of begging the question, where the conclusion is assumed in the premises.
	•	Oversimplification: The analogy of a father being older and having more authority than a son oversimplifies the relationship between God and Jesus, reducing a complex theological concept to a simplistic human analogy that may not accurately represent divine relationships.

Weasel Words and Phrases

	•	“Help him reason on the matter”: This phrase suggests that the student is not reasoning correctly and needs guidance, subtly undermining the student’s ability to think independently.
	•	“Focus on the material in the study publication”: This phrase subtly discourages critical thinking by limiting the discussion to the content provided by the organization, rather than encouraging a broader exploration of the topic.

Negative Effects on the Reader

	•	Intellectual Conformity: The emphasis on guiding students to specific conclusions can lead to intellectual conformity, where individuals are discouraged from exploring or expressing alternative viewpoints.
	•	Suppression of Critical Thinking: By steering conversations towards pre-determined conclusions and focusing on study materials, the article suppresses critical thinking, leading readers to accept teachings without questioning.
	•	Emotional Manipulation: The use of leading questions and the assumption that conflicting viewpoints must be corrected can create a sense of inadequacy or guilt in those who may have differing beliefs or struggle to understand the teachings.
	•	Reinforcement of Groupthink: The article’s approach to conversation and study can reinforce groupthink, where individuals are subtly pressured to align their thoughts and beliefs with those of the group, discouraging diversity of thought and individual interpretation.

In conclusion, while the article aims to instruct Jehovah’s Witnesses on effective ministry and teaching, it employs manipulative language, logical fallacies, and subtle weasel words to guide individuals toward a specific set of beliefs. This can have negative effects on readers, including the suppression of critical thinking, intellectual conformity, and emotional manipulation, which may limit personal growth and the exploration of alternative perspectives.

LIVING AS CHRISTIANS

7. Be Loyal When Praised
(7 min.) Discussion.

Manipulative Language

	•	Exemplification of Humility: By using Sergei as an example, the article subtly implies that humility in the face of praise is not just commendable but expected. This creates a normative standard for behavior that readers may feel pressured to adhere to, without considering whether it is always appropriate or healthy.
	•	Moral Obligation: The article frames the act of remaining humble when praised as a form of loyalty, suggesting that failure to do so could imply disloyalty or a lack of faith. This can manipulate readers into feeling guilty or unfaithful if they do not respond to praise in the prescribed manner.

Illogical Reasoning and Counterarguments

	•	False Equivalence: The article equates humility in response to praise with loyalty to faith. This is a false equivalence, as humility and loyalty are related but distinct concepts. One can be loyal to their faith without necessarily downplaying their achievements or feeling the need to dismiss praise.
	•	Overgeneralization: The assumption that all praise should be met with humility overlooks the value of recognizing and celebrating personal achievements. A skeptic might argue that accepting praise graciously can boost confidence and encourage further positive behavior, which is not inherently at odds with humility.

Logical Fallacies and Oversimplified Analogies

	•	Appeal to Authority: The article implies that because Jesus responded to praise with humility, followers must do the same. This appeal to authority (using Jesus as the ultimate example) doesn’t allow for individual differences in how people might healthily process and respond to praise.
	•	Slippery Slope: By suggesting that not responding humbly to praise could lead to disloyalty, the article creates a slippery slope fallacy. It implies that one small act of accepting praise might lead to larger issues of pride or disloyalty, which is an exaggerated conclusion.

Weasel Words and Phrases

	•	“Humble way that Sergei responded to praise”: The use of “humble” here is a weasel word that subtly imposes the idea that any other response to praise would be improper or less virtuous.
	•	“Loyal, as Jesus Was”: This phrase implies that any deviation from the behavior exemplified by Jesus is a failure in loyalty, using “loyal” as a loaded term that pressures readers to conform.

Negative Effects on the Reader

	•	Suppression of Self-Worth: The emphasis on humility in response to praise can lead readers to downplay their achievements and suppress feelings of self-worth, potentially leading to low self-esteem.
	•	Emotional Repression: By encouraging readers to always respond humbly to praise, the article may promote emotional repression, where individuals feel they must hide or diminish their accomplishments to appear virtuous.
	•	Fear of Pride: The article could instill an unhealthy fear of pride, leading readers to avoid acknowledging their strengths or successes, which can hinder personal growth and self-acceptance.
	•	Pressure to Conform: The constant comparison to Jesus and Sergei creates a standard of behavior that may not be realistic or applicable in all situations, pressuring readers to conform even when it may not be in their best interest.

In conclusion, while the article intends to promote humility and loyalty, it employs manipulative language and logical fallacies that can have negative psychological effects on readers. These include the suppression of self-worth, emotional repression, and an unhealthy fear of pride, which can inhibit personal growth and lead to feelings of inadequacy.

9. Congregation Bible Study
(30 min.) bt chap. 14 ¶7-10, box on p. 110

### Summary and Main Takeaways

The article discusses the role and decision-making process of the Governing Body of Jehovah's Witnesses, drawing parallels with the early Christian congregation as described in the Bible. It references a decision made by James in the first century, emphasizing that his proposal was not an assertion of authority but rather a suggestion based on scriptural evidence. The article then explains how the modern Governing Body operates similarly, seeking guidance from God and Jesus Christ before making decisions. It outlines the structure of the Governing Body, detailing the responsibilities of its various committees. The main takeaway is that the Governing Body, like its first-century counterpart, is portrayed as humble, scripturally guided, and not self-appointed leaders, but as followers of divine direction.

### Analysis

#### Manipulative Language
- **Appeal to Authority**: The article repeatedly appeals to religious authority by referencing the Bible and the actions of first-century Christians. By doing so, it attempts to establish that the modern Governing Body's decisions are divinely inspired and therefore beyond reproach.
- **Glorification of Leadership**: The article emphasizes the humility and spiritual guidance of the Governing Body, portraying them as exceptionally virtuous and selfless. This creates an image of infallibility and moral superiority, which can manipulate readers into unquestioningly accepting their authority.

#### Illogical Reasoning and Counterarguments
- **False Equivalence**: The article equates the decision-making process of James in the first century with that of the modern Governing Body, implying that both are equally divinely guided. A skeptic might argue that the contexts are vastly different, and that the Governing Body's decisions today are influenced by human interpretation rather than direct divine intervention.
- **Circular Reasoning**: The article assumes that the Governing Body's actions are correct because they are based on scripture, which the Governing Body itself interprets. This circular reasoning does not allow for the possibility that their interpretation could be flawed or that alternative interpretations could be valid.
- **Selective Presentation of Facts**: The article presents the actions of James and the Governing Body in a highly positive light, without acknowledging any historical or contemporary criticisms of their decisions. A more balanced approach would consider both positive and negative aspects, as well as differing opinions within the religious community.

#### Logical Fallacies and Oversimplified Analogies
- **Appeal to Tradition**: The article relies heavily on the appeal to tradition, arguing that because the early Christian congregation operated in a certain way, the modern Governing Body should do the same. This fallacy assumes that traditional practices are inherently correct without considering whether they are still relevant or effective today.
- **Straw Man**: The article suggests that questioning the Governing Body's decisions is equivalent to questioning God's will, which is a straw man fallacy. It oversimplifies potential criticisms by implying that dissenters are opposing divine authority, rather than engaging in thoughtful debate about the interpretation of scripture.

#### Weasel Words and Phrases
- **""May also mean""**: This phrase is used to provide an alternative interpretation of James' words that supports the article's argument, without definitively stating that this is the correct interpretation. It subtly shifts the reader's perspective without committing to a firm stance.
- **""Obviously it was""**: The use of ""obviously"" is a weasel word that attempts to shut down further discussion or questioning by asserting that the conclusion is self-evident, even though it may not be universally accepted.
- **""Spirit-anointed men""**: This phrase is loaded with religious significance, suggesting that the Governing Body members are specially chosen and guided by God. It discourages readers from questioning their authority by implying a divine endorsement.

#### Negative Effects on the Reader
- **Suppression of Critical Thinking**: The article discourages readers from questioning the decisions of the Governing Body by framing them as divinely inspired and beyond reproach. This can lead to a suppression of critical thinking and independent judgment.
- **Reinforcement of Groupthink**: By glorifying the unity and decision-making process of the Governing Body, the article promotes groupthink, where dissenting opinions are discouraged, and conformity is enforced.
- **Emotional Manipulation**: The portrayal of the Governing Body as humble, selfless, and spiritually guided can emotionally manipulate readers into feeling guilty or disloyal if they question their authority or decisions.
- **Erosion of Individual Autonomy**: The article's emphasis on the need to follow the Governing Body without question can erode individual autonomy, leading readers to rely on external authority figures for guidance in all aspects of their lives, rather than developing their own moral and spiritual judgments.

In conclusion, while the article aims to portray the Governing Body of Jehovah's Witnesses as humble and divinely guided, it employs manipulative language, illogical reasoning, and logical fallacies to discourage questioning and critical thinking. This can have negative effects on readers, including the suppression of independent thought, reinforcement of groupthink, and the erosion of individual autonomy.

If you find yourself sitting through a Jehovah's Witness meeting and you're not exactly thrilled about it, here's a clever survival guide to make the experience more bearable—and maybe even a little thought-provoking:

### 1. **Channel Your Inner Anthropologist**
Approach the meeting like you're an anthropologist studying a unique culture. Take mental notes on the rituals, language, and behaviors. How do people react to certain phrases or ideas? What are the unspoken rules? This mindset can keep your curiosity piqued and your critical thinking engaged.

### 2. **Play Buzzword Bingo**
Create a mental bingo card with common phrases like ""Jehovah's direction,"" ""humility,"" ""spiritual food,"" and ""divine guidance."" Every time you hear one, check it off in your mind. Bonus points if you get a full row and reward yourself with something sweet afterward. (Or perhaps ""buzzword blackout"" if you’re feeling ambitious.)

### 3. **Silent Debate Club**
For each point made, try to come up with a counter-argument or an alternative perspective. You don’t have to say it out loud, but internally, you can turn the experience into a mental exercise in critical thinking. Imagine you're on a debate team and your task is to dismantle the argument with logic and reason.

### 4. **Thought Experiment: The ""What If"" Game**
Play a mental ""What If"" game with each statement. For example:
- ""What if the Bible is interpreted differently?""
- ""What if humility isn’t always the best response to praise?""
- ""What if questioning authority is actually a sign of intellectual growth?""
This can help keep your mind sharp and your imagination active.

### 5. **The Silent Narrator**
Pretend you're narrating the meeting like a nature documentary. ""And here we see the elder in his natural habitat, delivering yet another discourse on the importance of submission. Notice the nodding heads in the audience, a ritual of agreement signaling their alignment with the group’s norms...""

### 6. **Mindful Doodling**
Bring along a notebook and pen, and instead of just taking notes, get creative. Doodle, sketch, or write down your thoughts and reactions in a way that amuses you. Draw cartoons that capture the essence of what's being said. It's a way to stay engaged without getting too bogged down in the content.

### 7. **Visualize Your Escape Plan**
Picture your favorite place or imagine the most relaxing vacation. Every time the meeting gets a bit too intense, mentally “escape” to your happy place. It’s like a mini-vacation without leaving your seat.

### 8. **Humor Yourself**
Find humor where you can. Think of clever puns or wordplay based on what's being said. For example, when they talk about ""spiritual food,"" imagine what kind of dish that would be—perhaps a ""Humble Pie"" or ""Salvation Stew""? A little humor can make the time pass quicker.

### 9. **Post-Meeting Reflections**
After the meeting, treat yourself to something enjoyable—a coffee, a walk, or a favorite show. Reflect on the experience and congratulate yourself for making it through with your sense of humor intact.

### 10. **Write a Satirical Summary**
When you get home, write a satirical summary of the meeting. Imagine you're writing a review for a very niche, very odd theater production. This will help you process the experience while having a bit of fun.

By approaching the meeting with a blend of curiosity, creativity, and humor, you can turn what might feel like a long, tedious experience into an opportunity for personal growth and mental exercise. Plus, you'll leave with some great stories and maybe even a few laughs.

Thanks for making it this far. 🤜🏼🤛🏼🫶🏼"

**The only public comparable for this company is HealWELL AI (TSX:AIDX) which is trading at a significantly higher multiple. A re-rate is IMMINENT here and I will explain why in this post with supporting evidence.** 



**The Next Industrial Revolution is Being Powered by Artificial Intelligence**

The dawn of the next industrial revolution is upon us, and its driving force is none other than Artificial Intelligence (AI). This transformative technology is reshaping industries, creating unprecedented opportunities, and redefining what is possible. This is an undeniable fact and it would be irresponsible as investors to ignore the AI revolution that is taking place in front of us.

Leading this charge is NVIDIA, whose stock has skyrocketed nearly 3,000% in recent years, making it the most valuable publicly-traded company on the planet. To put this into perspective, a $1,000 investment in NVIDIA a decade ago would be worth a staggering $297,605 today.

But how can you become a part of the AI revolution?

While industry giants like NVIDIA and Microsoft provide some exposure to AI, their sheer size might not satisfy investors looking for significant returns.

Enter **Treatment AI (OTC:TREIF)** - a nimble and innovative company at the intersection of AI and healthcare.

Treatment AI not only offers exposure to the AI revolution but also presents a fantastic opportunity for investors looking for a high-torque opportunity in the space.

**The Healthcare Industry is Ripe for Disruption**

Over the last few years, AI has been revolutionizing nearly every industry, reshaping the way we live and work on a global scale. Yet, one of the industries that has been late to the party when it comes to adoption of AI is healthcare.

The healthcare industry is ripe for disruption.

The healthcare systems in place today are outdated and failing to meet the needs of both providers and patients. Slow to embrace technology and innovation, these systems are now at a breaking point, with three in five people worldwide believing their healthcare is overstretched.

Accessibility remains a significant hurdle. In many countries, healthcare is prohibitively expensive and out of reach for many, even in regions with well-established infrastructures.

Have you ever felt unwell and resorted to Google or WebMD for answers? You're not alone. Millions do this daily, but these tools are often unreliable and can lead to misdiagnosis, exacerbating the problem rather than solving it.

**The Power Behind TRUE's AI: A Comprehensive Medical Database**

**Treatment AI (OTC:TREIF)** is an innovative healthcare tech company with a solution to these problems. They’ve developed a highly intelligent, personalized AI engine that helps doctors diagnose patient ailments more accurately and efficiently.

The image below demonstrates the customer journey when using the software, guiding users through steps to identify pain location, specify symptoms, report exposure and history, and receive diagnostic results based on their responses.

Now, you might be thinking a program like ChatGPT can do the exact same thing, but these large language models (“LLMs”) do not provide accurate or reliable information.

Unlike ChatGPT, TRUE’s AI software is non-generative, meaning it is all fact-based and cannot be contaminated. All of the possible answers that the software can output are already in the system.

The system is populated by the company’s proprietary Global Library of Medicine, which includes data on over 1,000 diseases and more than 10,000 symptoms and risk factors, all derived from real medical tests and peer-reviewed data.

TRUE’s proprietary Global Library of Medicine is one of the most comprehensive and integrated online medical libraries powered by AI. This database has taken more than 5 years, \~$10M, and input from hundreds of doctors worldwide to build.

Just how accurate is the software?

TRUE’s AI capabilities were tested by giving the software to an undergraduate non-medical student and letting the student take the OSCE exam – a medical school graduation requirement, testing clinical best practices, in 57 countries.

During the OSCE exam, medical students take turns going into 12 different rooms. Each room has a patient with a simulated medical condition which the student needs to diagnose by asking them questions and evaluating the patient’s answers.

The non-medical student using TRUE’s AI software passed the exam with a 92% success rate, correctly determining the “most likely diagnosis” in 11 of 12 complex diagnostic scenarios and the “second most likely diagnosis” in the 12th case.

In short, the software is incredibly accurate.

**The Market Opportunity**

**Treatment AI’s (OTC:TREIF)** customer base is segmented into two different areas: 1) ENT: for Enterprise and 2) MES: for Schools and Educators. The market opportunity for both segments is huge.

**Treatment ENT: Enhancing Enterprise Healthcare Solutions**

Treatment ENT leverages the GLM platform to provide enhanced clinical information support to healthcare enterprises and partners. This segment offers numerous applications, including integration with electronic medical records, health bots, virtual health services, medical call centers, and national triage services. The benefits for enterprises include expanded diagnostic support, integration with existing systems, more time for patient interactions, and reduced administrative costs. Additionally, Treatment ENT ensures security by sitting behind enterprise firewalls and opens up new revenue opportunities by enhancing existing healthcare services.

In the US alone, there are over 6,100 hospitals, 338,000 active physician group practices, and 1.1 million physicians. Globally, these numbers are obviously much greater.

**Treatment MES: Optimizing Performance in National Exams**

The Treatment MES platform is designed to support medical and nursing schools by streamlining the process of creating and grading national exams. It reduces the time, resources, and costs associated with exams such as MCQs and OSCEs, while minimizing administrative work. The platform ensures a consistent approach to case testing and scoring, provides suggested remedial guidance, and enhances school PR and intake processes. For students, Treatment MES offers the ability to practice for important exams, take remedial actions continuously, and access an authentic and always-available platform, ensuring they are well-prepared for their exams.

In the US, there are over 300 potential medical schools, 900 nursing schools, and hundreds of thousands of students.

**Strong Partnerships and Promising Pipeline**

The company already has several partnerships leveraging its technology and a strong pipeline of over 50 potential customers that are beginning to sign contracts—an excellent indication that the software is valuable to users. Notably, their partners include the prestigious Mayo Clinic and the University of Minnesota Medical School, both of which have substantial budgets and could lead to contracts worth six to seven figures in the near future.

A recent partnership with the AI tool marketplace aiXplain allows the company to claim 80% of the revenues, making their software the first healthcare solution on aiXplain’s platform. Additionally, their partnership with Novus Health exposes their software to an audience of 1.5 million members and their families.

**Potential Market Movers and Comparisons for TRUE**

There aren't many companies quite like TRUE. The closest comparable in the Canadian public market space is HealWELL AI, which has seen a huge surge of late, up over 220% in 2024.

Below is an image showing other similar players in the space — although, most are private and are much larger in size.

In the future, many of these companies are expected to go public with multi-billion dollar valuations. Those that don't will likely be acquired.

For instance, notable acquisitions in 2023 included NextGen Healthcare and Viewgol, which were bought at around 2.6 times revenue and 15 times EBITDA, respectively. Health Navigator, a private company similar to TRUE, was acquired by Amazon in October 2023 to support its Amazon Care service. Although mergers and acquisitions in this space have slowed recently, a resurgence could spark a re-rating of TRUE shares, especially if new deals or buyer interest emerge.

**Comparables Valuation**

The only other true comparable for Treatment AI in the Canadian public market space is HealWELL (TSX:AIDX). I have done a short comparable analysis with Treatment AI and HealWELL to highlight how deeply undervalued the company is.

[https://static.wixstatic.com/media/22f220\_6aa6a8586df4496eb09612286bb164ed\~mv2.png/v1/fill/w\_740,h\_165,al\_c,q\_85,usm\_0.66\_1.00\_0.01,enc\_auto/22f220\_6aa6a8586df4496eb09612286bb164ed\~mv2.png](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/22f220_6aa6a8586df4496eb09612286bb164ed~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_740,h_165,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/22f220_6aa6a8586df4496eb09612286bb164ed~mv2.png)

HealWELL currently has a market capitalization of \~$384mm and is trading at a 16.5x EV/sales multiple based on projected revenues for 2024. If we take this same multiple and apply it to TRUE’s projected 2024 revenues of $4.5mm, we get an implied relative valuation of $1.98 per share or 103% upside from current prices.

Looking forward to 2025, **Treatment AI’s (OTC:TREIF)** revenues are projected to increase to CAD$19mm. 

If we apply the 16.5x multiple to 2025 expected revenues of $19mm, we get an implied relative valuation of CAD$6.97 per share or 1180% upside from current prices. 

I have also factored in an additional 6M shares of dilution for a potential financing in 2025.

Keep in mind that this is a conservative estimate as it does not factor in two key points.

Firstly, not all of HealWELL’s revenues are considered to be “AI revenues”, whereas all of TRUE’s revenues are. AI revenues are valued at a higher multiple than medical service revenues in today’s market.

Secondly, Treatment AI's margins (84-95%) are higher than HealWELL’s (70-80%), which is not reflected in the above comparable analysis.

Thus, in reality, the per share valuation figure should be even higher.

**High-Margin SaaS Model and New Product Launches**

The company focuses on software subscription revenue, which lets them enjoy strong profit margins between 84% and 95%. Since they don't have to pay providers for access to users, more revenue goes straight to the bottom line, benefiting shareholders.

They're also planning to launch two new monthly SaaS products: AI Patient for educational purposes and AI Doctor in a Pocket for enterprise use. These high-margin products are the fastest way for the company to generate revenue, offering efficient software solutions to both current and new partners.

**The Bottom Line**

**Treatment AI (OTC:TREIF)** is set to revolutionize the healthcare industry with its innovative AI technology. By addressing critical challenges in diagnostics and offering reliable, fact-based solutions, they are transforming how healthcare is delivered. Their comprehensive medical database and proven diagnostic accuracy underscore their potential.

With significant partnerships already in place and a focus on high-margin, subscription-based revenue, Treatment AI is well-positioned for sustainable growth. The company's dual focus on enterprise and educational sectors opens vast market opportunities, making them a compelling choice for investors.

As AI continues to drive advancements across industries, Treatment AI stands out as a leader in healthcare innovation. Their commitment to improving patient care and their strategic market positioning ensure they are not just part of the AI revolution—they are at the forefront. For investors seeking significant returns and a stake in the future of healthcare, Treatment AI is a promising opportunity."
1ew61m7,1,2024-08-19,Expanding AI Infra beyond Nvidia w/ Nikhil Sonti of Felafax,u/oldmunk,gpu,https://www.reddit.com/r/gpu/comments/1ew61m7/expanding_ai_infra_beyond_nvidia_w_nikhil_sonti/,"I came across an interesting startup recently called Felafax, who are building an open-source AI platform for non-NVIDIA GPUs and did a podcast with them to learn more about the non Nvidia GPU ecosystem, it's challenges, how can they be used by engineers (The full show is here: https://youtu.be/kS2MqySWmUI)

**The non Nvidia landscape**

>

**Opportunity to build great developer tooling for this ecosystem**

>NVIDIA has over a decade of close integration with PyTorch using its CUDA kernels. So the performance per dollar is like really good there.

>And if you just use any other chip like TPU or Trainium and try to run the same PyTorch code, it's not that efficient. There's so much challenges to just get it up and running because there's no CUDA API.

>And yeah, where we fit in is we are trying to make it easier to run any of these popular LLM use cases like fine tuning and training or inference on these non -NVIDIA chipsets, like building the entire stack.

**Why would somebody use non -NVIDIA chipsets?**

>NVIDIA is amazing. What they've built so far is really valuable. looking five years down the lane or something, we can't have the entire LLM infrastructure just running on one single chipset.

>We have been talking with all these other players in AMD and Google TPUs.

>There are amazing chips out there, most people don't want to put all their eggs in one basket, rely heavily just on Nvidia GPUs. And second is like getting availability of these chips are like incredibly hard. Like if you want like quota for 100 Nvidia H100s, good luck trying to find that in your these big clouds. And now the alternative is like, can you use like these other chipsets, which are actually 50 % cheaper to do what you want and you have like much more capacity available. So there's a lot of demand around this.

>There is very little info around fine -tuning this. So that's one big value proposition from our side is we want to differentiate. And hey, you can easily go use this 50 % cheaper resource to fine -tune a large model and derive much better value for your customers than just relying on these smaller models.

**How does Felafax help?**

>We built an entire ML ops stack so that you can quickly come like select, I want 256 TPU cores and I want to fine tune Llama 3. And it just spins up all these things and you just get a Python notebook within a few minutes, you can go fine tune that.

>If you use this, you will be 2x more cost efficient. if someone is having a regular fine tuning, continuous pre -training use case or something, it's much more cheaper. the second differentiation we are thinking you can deploy this in -house in your own VPC of AWS or GCP cloud, take the benefits of the lower cost and also the performance.

>We think we can match the performance of NVIDIA. secondly, access to GPUs. Even big cloud providers, it's still hard to get as many GPUs as you want. But these other chips are much more easily accessible.

**Big Models or Small Models**

>

**What about fine tuning smaller models instead?**

>I mean, that seems to be the thesis right now, **but people are interested in these large models** and trying to figure out where they can fit in because it's one of those models which are very close to GPT -4, like Llama 400B, and they're looking at creative ways to include it in their own use cases, especially health care companies.

>I think there are some use cases where getting a 405B would dramatically increase the reasoning capabilities of your model. And second, I think the other use cases is using 405B to train a smaller model - the student teacher sort of architecture. I think that's one use case which is now developing

**How did Felafax come about?**

>Yeah, I think like a huge credit to this idea is just my brother. He spent like working in all these large tech companies building these exact same thing of distributed training infra within these teams. And over time, like he thought like, okay, there should be like easier ways to do it on other hardware too. And we had this kind of in a moment where we thought, hey, why is it not like people are not using other chipsets and is there something here we should explore?

**What further customer development did you end up doing?**

>I think over the months, like we have ended up refining more and more. Like our initial thing was, we'll build a distributor training infra. And that was very generic, but like talking to various customers, like two biggest use cases that are existing today is like fine tuning and inference.

>Yeah, I think people who are already in these have deployments in these clouds like GCP or AWS and looking for their own VPC deployment of LLM in front open source models like Llama3 or Gemini. They want to fine tune and deploy their fine tune models. I think these are the people who we are initially targeting because for them, since they're fine tuning and deploying, they need an infra which runs on their cloud. And also, the cost part makes a difference. If you're fine tuning frequently, if it's 50 % cheaper using the same provider like TPU on Google Cloud instead of NVIDIA, there is a big value add there. So those are the people who we are initially trying to target.

**Will Nvidia ever make their software portable?**

>I doubt if they'll ever do that because like that's their single biggest differentiator against any other GPU provider. And this PyTorch is so well integrated with CUDA that the performance there is amazing. There are alternatives to CUDA called XLA, which is a compiler. Yeah, all these non -NVIDIA kind of support XLA and you can build in front of it. You can do PyTorch XLA to run on these non -NVIDIA, but...the performance is still not there. PyTorch, XLA is in nascent days and the CUDA has like amazing integration.

**Doesn’t Pytorch work on TPUs? What’s Felafax’s unique value?**

>Yeah, like regarding pytorch supporting TPU It's on paper. It's like yeah pytorch XLA runs on TPU, but just getting it up and running on a TPU is challenging with like, or the right dependencies and the right modules and things, even after like, once you get it up and running, like the performance today is like not at par with just running PyTorch on Nvidia.

>So like for most people, like it's just easier to just take their model, run it on Nvidia. There's so much more resources out there.

>So our differentiator is going to be like, we want to firstly like make the PyTorch XLA work well. And second, we are building on top of this other framework called Jax, which is much more closely integrated with TPU and the entire XLA thing. And which should give us like differentiator in terms of like performance there.

**Where does OSS fit into your go-to-market?**

>Our main thesis for open source was that we wanted to make it easier for anyone to just run. We spent two three weeks just trying to get some pytorch models running on XLA hardware

>So our goal was like, it should be super easy for anyone who wants to try out non -NVIDIA hardware to come and use it, spin up their own TPUs and things and like run it.

>But if they're looking for even simpler solution where we orchestrate the entire solution, they can use a cloud sort of solution, which can take scare of abstracts of even more challenges. And you just come use it for like spinning up the TPU and run the entire notebook.

>And also there's so much resources for open source and developer support. I think being open source and engaging with developers might be easier to also like build out the vision and like get their feedback early on

**Startups should try to get more bang for their buck when it comes to GPUs**

>Many of these startups get like half a million in free credits. And at that point, you're mostly not thinking so much of resources like Nvidia versus others. But eventually those credits will run out and you'll start paying from your real dollars.

>The regular VM instances, like some 250k or 300k credits, last a long time. But GPUs are super expensive and also like to do fine tuning and things you need to try multiple experimentation and then run inference. And these are really expensive use cases.

>So they don't last as long as you initially like plan for. It's always good to like have diverse options in the back of your mind and also like see if there is a much cheaper way to do it."

1ew9568,74,2024-08-19,[TOMT] [Series/Movie] [last 5-10 years]- A student couple is filming a documentary about who killed boyfriend's father. Winds up learning mom and dad were into weird stuff. Girl dies before she can tell boyfriend truth.,u/myweatheraccount,tipofmytongue,https://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmytongue/comments/1ew9568/tomt_seriesmovie_last_510_years_a_student_couple/,"Don't know why this one came to mind today, but it's killing my I can't remember. Was even trying to use ChatGPT and couldn't come up with an answer. Here's what I've got so far...

1. **Interracial Couple Making a Documentary**: The series involves an interracial couple, film students, who initially set out to make a documentary on a different subject.
2. **Visit to Boyfriend's Home**: The couple visits the boyfriend's home in the UK or Ireland. A few awkward meals with the mother. They make multiple mentions that the town used to be a great holiday spot until the killing of the father. Flashbacks of local media from 20-30 years ago.
3. **Boyfriend's Father**: The boyfriend's father was a police officer who was reportedly killed in the line of duty. However, it’s revealed that he was actually killed by someone he had captured.
4. **Change in Documentary Focus**: Upon learning of the boyfriend's father’s death and the mysterious circumstances surrounding it, the couple switches their documentary focus to investigate who killed the boyfriend's father.
5. **Dark Family Secrets**: The couple uncovers disturbing secrets about the boyfriend's parents, who were involved in very disturbing activities. Filters won't allow me to elaborate. During these acts, the parents wore masks, with the mother wearing a mask with deer antlers (possibly).
6. **Local Pub**: The couple visits a local pub where the owner’s son, who is the boyfriend’s childhood friend, helps them investigate what really happened.
7. **Discovery of a Recording**: Toward the end of the series, the girlfriend finds a recording that reveals the truth about the boyfriend's father’s death.
8. **Chase and Injury**: The mother chases the girlfriend after she discovers the recording. The girlfriend slips and hits her head, leading to her death (I think?), and as a result, the boyfriend never finds out what actually happened.
9. **Limited Standalone Series**: The series is a modern, standalone limited series, released within the last five years, and it was originally produced in English.

Any help would be appreciated!"

Am I cooked?,u/ZinhajaWasTaken,PinoyProgrammer,https://www.reddit.com/r/PinoyProgrammer/comments/1ewjpwh/3rd_year_cs_student_having_career_crisis_am_i/,"as the title suggests, the semester just started and i'm currently a 3rd year student, with mediocre programming skills at best.

I never had any interest in coding because I was more interested in the design industry (graphic design mainly). I made a few CRUD projects with database and PHP, but I chatgpt'ed my way in completing it. Had good grades as well (even a consistent dean's lister until 2nd year), but I think i didn't learn anything.

Now I'm questioning myself if I should continue pursuing this course or maybe take a break muna to explore what I career I really want. 

I tried upskilling, like trying to study frameworks like REACT or JS since I'm leaning into front-end development because of my design passion. Pero wala talagang motivation and interest in learning. I try my best naman pero my mindset of not being good enough (di ko pa rin sure if enough yung knowledge ko about HTML,CSS or JS) or the pressure makes me unproductive and stuck in this cycle.

In preparation for my thesis and for the purposes of self exploration I would like to read what I can in my time to help broaden my understanding of all different types of belief systems. 

ChatGPT gave me the below list for the top 100 most influential philosophies of all human history. I was gonna just go with that list and pick a book for each one, as it looks pretty cohesive and like what I’m looking for but I’m nervous it may have missed key points, (as ai does with its unoriginality). Plus, I thought if I’m dedicating myself to this I might as well do it right. So I’m seeking advice yall, what 100 books should I read? 

My ultimate goal is to become a better writer and thinker myself through this, as well as learn more about my self, humanity, and all different types of beliefs and how they might align to create a common vision. Much love peeps and thanks!

1ewnnku,1,2024-08-20,Hello and Help! Prerequisites topics to survive Calc 1 as a freshman,u/100TheCoolest17,learnmath,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/comments/1ewnnku/hello_and_help_prerequisites_topics_to_survive/,"Hi everyone I'm (20F) a first year engineering student and unfortunately, like many I was a victim of the pandemic. My school years from grade 10-12 were all held online even after IRL Classes started (I even took a gap year to work part time and save up. So you can imagine my mind has been left blank for 4 straight years with my 3 years of online classes comprising of copypasting from ChatGPT)

and because of that I've trying to learn the topics needed for Calc 1 but since I don't have a proper curriculum/study plan. I've been jumping from Algebra to PreCal to Algebra, its been really really messy. I still chose an engineering program even in my situation because I really really love working with hardware and I want to make a career out of it!! I don't want my carelessness that'a coming to bite me in the ass to kill my dream

So I'd like if anyone can help and tell me what topics I need to survive Calc 1?"
1ewo31s,1,2024-08-20,"DAT Breakdown (22 AA, 22 TS, 20 PAT) ",u/exalted_0,predental,https://www.reddit.com/r/predental/comments/1ewo31s/dat_breakdown_22_aa_22_ts_20_pat/,"Hi everybody! I just finished my test a couple of hours ago! Ever since I stumbled on one of these I've always wanted to do one of my own. I enjoyed reading the different ways people approached studying for this test, and so I wanted to share how I did it!

**Background:** I am currently a rising senior in college, and will be applying during the 2025 application cycle. I figured that the summer before I applied would give me the most time to study, and I'm grateful that I've made the right choice. For reference, I am by no means a smart student, but I do work very hard. My GPA is a 3.64 oGPA and 3.41 sGPA with a very strong upward trend. I ended with a C+ in Gen Chem I (still my weakness to this very day) and throughout my freshman and sophomore years I ended up with B's in many of the prerequisites. I started studying very hard, (I guess you could call it over studying) my junior year and I'd like to say it's paid off. While studying for the DAT, I did not take one rest day. I knew how disappointed I'd be if I didn't get a score I aimed for, so I held myself accountable and didn't take any chances. I basically studied full time for these three months. My memory isn't very good, nor were my foundations for both Gen Chem and Bio so I knew I'd have to put in these hours to get a score I wanted.

Even though I didn't take any rest days, a decent amount of my time ""studying"" was me also on my phone scrolling reddit or procrastinating on the DAT discord group throughout the day (y'all should really join) lol so I guess those served as my breaks and it honestly helped me refresh in between studying sessions. I also didn't start getting burnt out until three days before the exam. I am a very resilient person so I guess that contributes as well.

As for my background on these subjects, my strongest point was definitely Orgo, with my weakest being Gen Chem. While I only got a B- and B in Orgo I and II respectively, I honestly worked very hard for that grade and learned a lot of fundamentals in that class. Because it was such a hard class, the grade didn't translate but I am honestly so grateful I took it. In Gen Chem I and II my freshman year, I basically cruised the entire year half of it due to being a stupid freshman and the other half was because it was online. I had absolutely zero foundation going into the DAT for Gen Chem. I will go into it more in depth later on, but I got like 7-8 practice tests in a row under 18 which made me feel very discouraged, but fortunately it shot up to 20+ like two weeks before the test. Bio was mostly in between these two. I definitely had some foundation, but a lot of it was brand new to me, such as all of the different human systems besides the endocrine system. I am very thankful I took ecology and endocrinology during my junior year because they really helped me retain at least SOME info lol.

**Materials**

1. DAT Booster: I will go more in depth on this later, but for the most part Booster really helped me prepare. I bought it during a sale and paused it until I started studying to help with the expensive price. I followed its 12-week schedule until about Phase II, then I just completely ignored it. For bio, I only I also took every single practice test, some of them more than once. During my last week of study, I made it a priority to make sure I knew the answer to EVERY SINGLE question (especially on bio) in case I got any repeats. Unfortunately this was not the case. I will go more in depth on this later!
2. Booster Crash Course: I attended two bio crash courses about 1.5 weeks before my test. To be brutally honest, it didn't help me much, and it was simply too broad to have helped me in any way during my bio test. I think that if you are scoring below 19 and really need a good resource to jumble everything together, they would be a great resource to attend. I did not think clearly at the time and thought they were a good idea to raise my score 2-3 points like most people claim. In all honesty, by the time I attended these I was at peak knowledge for bio so a lot of it was just too broad to do much for me.
3. DAT Bootcamp: During my last 4 days, I was able to take some Bootcamp science section tests just to test my knowledge. I didn't use any of their question banks or videos.
4. Anki: I used this for the first two months. I mostly used the 4000+ anki deck that booster gives. It was good until I started getting 1000 review cards near the end of it. That's when I switched off methods and made my own flashcards on random facts I did not know while going through cheat sheets, watching videos, etc. For those two months though, anki was my saving grace for sure.
5. Chads Prep: I didn't use this too much aside from the learning phase. Instead of booster's gen chem and ochem videos, I watched Chad's lectures because they were much better in my opinion. Don't bother with his practice tests though.

**Scores**

1. Biology - 20

This was honestly such a disappointing score to me, especially since I spent the most ""time"" on it. I didn't get any repeat questions on this section, nor did I have an easy one. Booster's practice exams were not representative at all of my test and I am honestly so grateful I ended with a 20 because it did not feel like I got a 20 while taking it. Without going into too much specifics, most of my questions weren't the types that Booster would ask. Unfortunately thats the play of the game though, because either you get a test that is similar to Booster/Bootcamps or you don't, and unfortunately I did not. Most of my questions consisted of genetics, cell bio, some questions on the circulatory system, bactera/virus questions, and some on photosynthesis. I did not have any questions on the ecology section or taxonomy. I think if I were to get more simpler questions like the ones shown on Booster/Bootcamp, I would've gotten a higher score, but it is what it is and I'm still super grateful for how everything turned out.

As I mentioned before, I studied this section pretty much DAILY with Anki starting from day 1. I worked through half of the 2000 card Anki deck booster provides, and then I worked through the other 4,000 card deck they provide. During these two months, I would start my studying off with making sure all of my review cards were finished in the morning. At night time was when I'd start learning new cards. I didn't have a set of new cards learned per day, I kind of just played by ear depending how I was feeling. I really recommend both if you're someone who struggles with retaining information. After about two months, the review cards started getting way too much for me to keep up with. I changed my study methods to copy and pasting the cheat sheets into ChatGPT and asking it to quiz me on EVERY SINGLE FACT so that I'd get all of the information on those cheat sheets. Whatever questions I got wrong would instantly get made into a flashcard. I really liked this way of studying because although its not equivalent to the sheer amount of volume anki provides, it allowed me to really connect with the material because I was the one who wrote/created it myself if that makes sense. I reviewed these flashcards for about a month until test day once every 2-3 days. Throughout these three sciences, you will see me refer to FLASHCARDS because that is honestly what I feel like changed the game entirely for me.

2. Gen Chem - 22

For those of you like me who struggle with Gen Chem, you have hope. I attached my practice scores, and you can clearly see I STRUGGLED with this section for like 6-7 straight practice tests. Seeing all of my work translate to alternating 18s and 16s really messed with me, but I didn't let it get to my head and made sure to try new study methods to see which ones really worked for me. As I mentioned before, I had little no background with this topic, so I was learning everything from scratch. I mainly watched Chad's Prep for this during the learning phase, and went through the question banks.

Even though I was pouring my heart and soul into this section, nothing seemed to be working. I was rewatching the videos, redoing the question banks, doing Chad's prep questions (those killed me) for hours and hours and my scores were still stagnant at 16 & 18. By around test 6 or 7, I knew something had to change, so like biology, I went back to flashcards. This time, instead of going through the q banks and sort of just falling into the trap of ""skipping"" missed questions, I made sure to create a flashcard for EVERY SINGLE QUESTION that I got wrong or felt unsure about. If there was an answer choice I didn't understand, I made a flashcard for that as well. I also made flashcards for every single practice question I got incorrect. Like biology, I went through these every couple of days. Yes, it was very brutal to go through all those calculations/in depth questions but I honestly think that it helped me raise my score to an average of 22. I really recommend trying this if you are running out of options and aren't seeing an increase in scores. Gen Chem is a daunting section, but if I was able to pull it off, you will be able to as well!

For the actual test portion, I felt like it was fairly representative of Booster. There were definitely a few questions that Booster didn't even (teach?) but I remember seeing in my gen chem classes very briefly. The questions were worded slightly differently, so I'd make sure to not get too used to the way Booster words their questions because their repetitiveness can kind of make you too comfortable in a way. Chances are you know the answer to the question, its just worded strangely.

Organic Chemistry - 25

This section of the DAT seemed to be the most representative of Booster. Unlike gen chem and bio, you can't really manipulate the wordings of questions for ochem. I would say that 28/30 of the questions I knew for sure how to do, and two of them were questions that I just forgot the rules of or something small like that. There weren't really any curve balls here, so just make sure you're always studying the reactions, ppm values for CNMR and HNMR, acidity ranking, lab techniques, etc. I also had a fair amount of reaction questions, and two multi-step synthesis problems.

During the learning phase, I kind of neglected this section because I was scoring 20s right off the bat because of my strong foundation during my sophomore year. I think that this section can be pretty intimidating especially if you're learning it from scratch, but it gets easier once you really get very comfortable the basic fundamentals of how electrons move, electrophiles/nucleophiles, etc. After the learning phase though, I started to double down more on this section using MORE FLASHCARDS...(RIP the trees) I went and made a flash card for every single reaction, and I also went through every question bank and made a card for everything I got wrong just like in gen chem. Additionally, I made cards specifically for the organic lab tests, CNMR and HNMR ppm values (I got a question on this asking what the value of an aromatic hydrogen was so dont neglect this), acidity ranking rules, etc. LIke gen chem and bio, I went through these every 2-3 days. At the end of my studying, I had a stack of flashcards that combined the three sciences that was easily a foot tall! I know that sounds scary, but there are obbiously cards that stick much easier than others, so I would put the ones I knew how to do more easily to the side once to focus more on the difficult ones. I would put on a movie to keep me focused while I do the cards.

PAT - 20

During my learning phase, I made it a priority to spend at least 30 minutes a day getting better at PAT. In the beginning phase, I found it very fun to do and it was a nice break between all of the gen chem and biology I was doing. Once I started the review phase, I honestly never practiced this section again aside from the practice tests. Once I found out that the practice test questions (especially for TFE and pattern folding) were not representative of the question bank problems, I instantly stopped doing them. There was no point in me scoring 95%+ on the question banks then getting 7/15 on the practice tests. The method that I practiced and stuck with during the test was to do questions angle ranking, hole punching, cube counting, then pattern folding, skipping ALL questions that I couldn't solve within a reasonable amount of time or was completely lost on how to solve. Then, I went all the way back to keyholes, and then filled in ""A"" for every single TFE since it was my weakest section. By this time I'd still have about 17-20 minutes left, so then I clicked ""review incomplete"" and basically retried all of the questions I started with initially. I think being able to re-look at a problem with a fresh pair of eyes really helps and I often find myself being able to solve a decent amount of them the second time around. Once I finished completing all of the incompletes, I would have around 10-12 minutes left to try my best at TFE. I was a lost cause for this section, so making sure I prioritized other sections before this one helped me maintain scores above 20 at the very least.

When I got my score, I was honestly surprised because I thought I scored a lot higher. Angle ranking, TFE, and cube counting were SIGNIFICANTLY easier than Booster or Bootcamp practice tests. TFE was laughably easy, it was on par to the question banks they provide. There was one shape where it literally had no dotted lines and had four sides maximum. I don't even know how to explain it but it was that simple lol. Angle ranking had a lot of acute angles which made it easier as well. I wasn't hit with any weird cube counting shapes, although I did get one with a floating cube in it.

Hole punching was a little different than booster, and I'd really recommend trying out one of Bootcamp's practice tests because this section was most similar to theirs. It was relatively difficult, but nothing too crazy. I think that both Bootcamp and Booster represented Keyholes very well, and I lucked out because I only got one rock keyhole during it as well. Pattern folding was similar, maybe a little bit tougher than the practice tests, but nothing that really stood out to me.

RC - 21

I don't read at ALL during my free time, and only read when I have to. I am a pretty fast reader, but I tend to forget facts pretty easily. For this section, I completed all of the question banks during my learning phase. After that, the only time I practiced RC was during the full length practice tests.

I tried a bunch of different strategies, but the one I found the most success with was the vanilla method. The highlighting function really helped me find answers quickly after reading the entire passage. If you're a fast reader but bad information retainer like me, I think this is the best strategy for you since it involves scanning sections relatively quickly and knowing where everything generally is, while still being able to get the overall jist of the passage for those more difficult conceptual questions.

My first passage on my test was more difficult than any one of Booster's RC sections. It was related to telephones, fiber optics, etc. and I just had no interest in reading it at all lol. It had quite a few conceptuals and those true and false statements. I'm not gonna lie, when I was mid-test during this section I thought I was cooked. Luckily, my second passage was SO EASY. The questions were all factual based, and it was weird because they were all asked in the order of the passage. I didn't even need to highlight anything because I was just going down the passage and finding the answer. My third passage was a decent mix of both, and more representative of the Booster practice tests. None of the three RC passages exceeded 14 paragraphs, so I guess I lucked out on that.

QR - 20

QR was a section I dreaded studying for. I am very good at ""doing"" math, but awful at setting up equations in relation to word problems. For this section, I watched all the videos, did all of the question banks, and re-did practice test questions. My only hope for this section was to make flashcards for everything I got wrong and solve them out of muscle memory. I was hoping that the actual test would have problems worded similarly, and then I'd be able to solve them not because I understood how to set it up, but because I've practiced it a million times lol. During the learning phase, I didn't really put any emphasis on this section, but during the last three weeks I started doubling down on all of the equations/probability questions.

The actual test was pretty representative of Booster. I didn't get many surprise questions, but I unfortunately just didn't know how to solve a decent amount of them. I don't really have any advice on this section, and to be honest I dont think you should follow my way of studying it lol. The calculator on this section allowed me to type in numbers on the keyboard for anyone wondering!

**Overall**

Unfortunately, I didn't get that 2-3 point jump that a lot of people seem to get which bums me out a little bit. I could've gotten an easy bio section and seen a great increase in my score. Regardless, I am blessed and truly grateful for the score that I received. Attached below are my practice test averages for both booster and bootcamp. For those with stagnating scores, I just want to let you know that my scores didn't see an increase until 2 weeks before the exam. I was stuck at a 20 for about 7-8 straight practice tests but thankfully pulled through.

This was such a journey and I want to thank all of those who have posted their breakdowns because all of those posts helped me form my methods of studying that I used for this test. I would also like to mention that my discord DAT group that I am a part of was a big reason why studying wasn't as tiring as it should've been. It is nice and very motivating to talk with other people who are also working towards the same goal as you. The group has over 100+ members with questions being asked and answered every single day. I really recommend you join it and see if it helps motivate you! [https://discord.gg/SC8ZJCbu](https://discord.gg/SC8ZJCbu)

I do not have people in my personal life to support me or guide me (financially, emotionally, etc). 

I was a Gifted and Talented kid, 4.0 Honors high schooler, scholarship college student, and my internship led to a graduate position that paid my tuition and a stipend. I read (past tense), sold my own art, worked out at 5AM for fun, and loved yoga so much I got certified to teach. 

I've had multiple therapists. I'm on Ritalin, and it does make a difference. My therapists have ranged from useless to downright traumatic. My current provider only meets with me once every few months as legally required to continue my Ritalin prescription, but the person I meet changes every other time so there is no long standing connection. 

I'm overwhelmed with an underwhelming, underpaying job that leaves me feeling sick. I am overwhelmed with taking care of the house I rent: cleaning, organizing, maintenance, and keeping up with my jungle of a front, back, and side yard. I have savings but since 2020 have had trouble finding a ""boring"" job that I can do, doesn't hurt me physically, and doesn't have an abusive boss. 

I know there is useful, effective help out there. I've navigated my insurance before, with difficulty, but ultimately end up with professionals who either completely discount me or just are not versed in my fun mix of problems.

This is a long post, and clearly a cry for help, but what would be useful is:
- Does anyone know of a specific title of a professional who could help me navigate actionable tasks through life? 
- Has anyone ever successfully gotten their insurance to cover a life coach, success coach, ADHD/neurodivergent coach, etc.? 
- Are there any sites like Unfuck Your Habitat, goblin.tools, ""Dad, How Do I...?"" videos, ChatGPT, even Mrs. Hinch, that you use and have actually helped you understand how to manage life?

A big issue with me asking for help is that it takes tremendous effort and exhausts me, especially because I've been burned so spectacularly before, *and* when people meet me I guess I present myself as stable, okay, and doing fine. It's like because *other* people are observably suffering, I'm actually okay and making up problems. I just want to be able to ask stupid shit like ""How do I find a job that doesn't make me want to walk into the ocean?"" and actually figure out a realistic plan together.

Are there mentors out there for us??

The responsibility is enormous: Each year, 23,000 students take writing courses under his oversight. The teachers’ work is even harder today than it was a few years ago, thanks to AI tools that can generate competent college papers in a matter of seconds. [~https://theatln.tc/fwUCUM98~](https://theatln.tc/fwUCUM98) 

“A mere week after ChatGPT appeared in November 2022, The Atlantic declared that ‘The College Essay Is Dead.’ Two school years later, Jensen is done with mourning and ready to move on. The tall, affable English professor co-runs a National Endowment for the Humanities–funded project on generative-AI literacy for humanities instructors, and he has been incorporating large language models into ASU’s English courses. Jensen is one of a new breed of faculty who want to embrace generative AI even as they also seek to control its temptations. He believes strongly in the value of traditional writing but also in the potential of AI to facilitate education in a new way—in ASU’s case, one that improves access to higher education.

“But his vision must overcome a stark reality on college campuses. The first year of AI college ended in ruin, as students tested the technology’s limits and faculty were caught off guard. Cheating was widespread. Tools for identifying computer-written essays proved insufficient to the task. Academic-integrity boards realized they couldn’t fairly adjudicate uncertain cases: Students who used AI for legitimate reasons, or even just consulted grammar-checking software, were being labeled as cheats. So faculty asked their students not to use AI, or at least to say so when they did, and hoped that might be enough. It wasn’t.

“Now, at the start of the third year of AI college, the problem seems as intractable as ever. When I asked Jensen how the more than 150 instructors who teach ASU writing classes were preparing for the new term, he went immediately to their worries over cheating … ChatGPT arrived at a vulnerable moment on college campuses, when instructors were still reeling from the coronavirus pandemic. Their schools’ response—mostly to rely on honor codes to discourage misconduct—sort of worked in 2023, Jensen said, but it will no longer be enough: ‘As I look at ASU and other universities, there is now a desire for a coherent plan.’”

After my PG Diploma I did 3 internships and the 3rd one was a paid one at a startup as a Backend Developer where I was contributing to a project (which was building a chatbot for each category like legal, education etc) and the skills were Django Rest Framework, AWS, LLM, Django, and LangChain.

To be honest I had 0 skills or knowledge in the field of NLP, and had basic projects in Django. I was still hired at a very low stipend after a very short interview and there was another intern along with 2 seniors in the team. I struggled a lot and had daily tasks to complete and push code. But I was able to work through it by using chatgpt and reading documentation.

I worked for 3 months (till mid-march of 2024) and since then I have been occupied with family issues and helping dad. Later around July I started brushing up on my basics of Python and working my way upward in the previous bootcamp and courses I had taken up. So far I am studying the basics of ML algorithms.

It's August and I am struggling to get a job. I have 1 paper to be published in Springer relevant to sentiment analysis.

I am stagnating here. Was thinking of doing a non-thesis master's in CS from US (staring with a foundation/bridge course or certificate and then entering master's)

But given the current economy, the market in US and my profile I am not sure of taking that risk considering I will have to pledge the apartment as collateral for loan that my dad worked so hard to save and build (I come from a middle class family).

Please help me out. I love CS but lately I have just been very depressed since I am not able to get a job and just confused if I should pursue it further.

I really want to go outside Indian (Preference is USA) and open to suggestions for other countries and courses given my scenario and qualifications like MS in Business analytics, MBA, MS in Fintech etc. But for me the **priority is to pay of the student debt**.

I am ready to work my ass of in master's.

Your valuable advice can change my life."

1ewz6ob,10,2024-08-20,Using Reverse Theological Argument (a guide for your PIMI convos),u/constant_trouble,exjw,https://www.reddit.com/r/exjw/comments/1ewz6ob/using_reverse_theological_argument_a_guide_for/,"The amazing thing about this guide is that these were questions I already had and couldn’t articulate. Thanks ChatGPT!

A Thoughtful Guide to Engaging Jehovah’s Witnesses in Theological Conversation

Introduction: The Art of Engaging a Jehovah’s Witness

This guide aims to help you navigate these conversations with grace and intellect, offering strategies that invite reflection, encourage deeper exploration, and, yes, sometimes even incorporate a dash of humor to keep things light.

1. The Reverse Theological Argument: Flipping the Script

The Reverse Theological Argument (RTA) is your trusty tool for these conversations. Instead of trying to prove or disprove God’s existence outright, the RTA takes traditional theological arguments and flips them on their head, offering new angles to ponder. Here’s how to do it, with examples tailored for engaging Jehovah’s Witnesses using their preferred Bible, the New World Translation (NWT).

2. Problem of Evil (Theodicy Reversed): Why the Long Suffering?

Example 1: The Disproportionate Suffering of the Innocent

	•	Scripture: Isaiah 45:15 (NWT) - “Truly you are a God who hides himself, the God of Israel, a Savior.”
	•	Question: If Jehovah is a loving Father, why does He remain hidden, especially from those who sincerely seek Him? If He wants a relationship with everyone, why not be a bit more, well, obvious?
	•	Ask Yourself: Imagine if parents played hide-and-seek with their kids 24/7—at some point, it stops being fun and starts being frustrating. Is there a chance Jehovah’s hiddenness could be a bit like that?

Example 2: The Length of Human History

	•	Scripture: 2 Peter 3:8 (NWT) - “However, do not let this one fact escape your notice, beloved ones, that one day is with Jehovah as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day.”
	•	Question: If Jehovah has the power to bring an end to suffering, why allow thousands of years of pain and hardship before He acts? Couldn’t the issue of universal sovereignty have been resolved more quickly?
	•	Ask Yourself: If you had the ability to end suffering immediately, wouldn’t you do so? What might be the reason for Jehovah’s extended timeline?

Example 3: The Existence of Gratuitous Evil

	•	Scripture: Job 1:8-12 (NWT) - The conversation between Jehovah and Satan about Job.
	•	Question: Why would Jehovah allow Satan to bring immense suffering upon Job just to prove a point? Is this how divine justice works?
	•	Ask Yourself: It’s like when your friend dares you to drink a mystery smoothie, and you end up regretting all your life choices. Is there a lesson here, or just unnecessary suffering?

3. Teleological Argument Reversed: Is Everything Really Designed?

Example 1: The Flawed Design of the Human Body

	•	Scripture: Psalm 139:14 (NWT) - “I praise you because in an awe-inspiring way I am wonderfully made. Your works are wonderful, I know this very well.”
	•	Question: If humans are “wonderfully made,” how do we explain the many flaws in the human body, such as the vulnerability of the spine to injury or the presence of vestigial organs like the appendix, which can cause life-threatening conditions?
	•	Ask Yourself: It’s like praising a car for being “wonderfully made” but then realizing it has a faulty engine and no airbags. Is the design really that perfect?

Example 2: The Vastness and Inhospitality of the Universe

	•	Scripture: Psalm 8:3-4 (NWT) - “When I see your heavens, the works of your fingers, the moon and the stars that you have prepared, what is mortal man that you keep him in mind, and a son of man that you take care of him?”
	•	Question: If Jehovah created the universe for humans, why is so much of it empty, vast, and uninhabitable? Why would a loving Creator design a universe where humans occupy such an infinitesimally small and fragile space?
	•	Ask Yourself: It’s like building a massive mansion but only furnishing a tiny closet and leaving the rest empty. Does that make sense for a design with humans in mind?

Example 3: The Existence of Natural Disasters

	•	Scripture: Romans 8:20-22 (NWT) - “For the creation was subjected to futility, not by its own will, but through the one who subjected it, in hope that the creation itself will also be set free from enslavement to corruption and have the glorious freedom of the children of God. For we know that all creation keeps on groaning together and being in pain together until now.”
	•	Question: If the Earth is designed to be a habitable place for humanity, why do natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, and tsunamis occur, causing massive destruction and loss of life? Are these disasters part of the original design, or do they indicate something else about the nature of our world?
	•	Ask Yourself: It’s like designing a house with a beautiful exterior but installing an unpredictable time bomb in the basement. Does that reflect a well-intentioned design?

Example 4: The Imperfections of Reproductive Processes

	•	Scripture: Genesis 3:16 (NWT) - “To the woman he said: ‘I will greatly increase the pain of your pregnancy; in pain you will give birth to children…’ “
	•	Question: If reproduction is vital for life, why did Jehovah design it to be so fraught with pain and risk? Couldn’t a more efficient and less dangerous process have been implemented?
	•	Ask Yourself: It’s like designing a machine that’s essential for survival but making it incredibly painful and prone to breaking down. Is this really the best possible design?

Example 5: The Evolution of Predatory Behavior

	•	Scripture: Isaiah 11:6-7 (NWT) - “The wolf will reside for a while with the lamb, and with the young goat the leopard will lie down… The lion will eat straw just like the bull.”
	•	Question: If Jehovah originally intended animals to live peacefully together, why do we see so much predation and violence in the natural world today? Was this part of the original design or a consequence of something else?
	•	Ask Yourself: It’s like planning a peaceful neighborhood but filling it with aggressive animals. How do we explain the current state of nature?

4. Moral Argument Reversed: Is Morality Really Divine?

Example 1: Changing Moral Standards

	•	Scripture: Deuteronomy 7:2 (NWT) - “And Jehovah your God will give them over to you, and you must defeat them. You should without fail devote them to destruction. You must not make any covenant with them or show them any favor.”
	•	Question: How can we reconcile this command with the idea that Jehovah’s morality is unchanging? Does morality evolve, or is there another explanation?
	•	Ask Yourself: Imagine the CEO of a company changing the company’s core values every few years. Would you still trust the company’s vision, or start to wonder what’s really going on?

Example 2: The Existence of Moral Relativism

	•	Scripture: Genesis 22:2 (NWT) - The command to sacrifice Isaac.
	•	Question: If Jehovah’s commands are always moral, how do we understand this command, which seems to go against basic human ethics? What does this mean for divine morality?
	•	Ask Yourself: If your friend told you it’s okay to take a “short cut” through someone’s yard, but it involves jumping fences and dodging dogs, you might question their idea of a shortcut. Is divine morality straightforward, or are there fences to jump?

Example 3: The Euthyphro Dilemma

	•	Scripture: 2 Corinthians 12:8-9 (NWT) - Paul’s unanswered prayers.
	•	Question: Why does Jehovah’s response seem to be “no” to Paul’s plea? If His power is made perfect in weakness, what does this mean for the nature of divine help?
	•	Ask Yourself: It’s like asking your gym coach to ease up on the weights and getting told, “No pain, no gain!” Is there a more loving way to build strength?

5. Cosmological Argument Reversed: Is the Universe Self-Existent?

Example 1: The Self-Existence of the Universe

	•	Scripture: Psalm 90:2 (NWT) - “Before the mountains were born or you brought forth the earth and the productive land, from everlasting to everlasting, you are God.”
	•	Question: If Jehovah is described as existing “from everlasting to everlasting,” what prevents the universe itself from being eternal or self-existent? Why does the universe need a creator if we can conceive of something existing eternally?
	•	Ask Yourself: It’s like asking why only one thing can be eternal. If Jehovah can exist without a cause, why can’t the universe exist without one as well?

Example 2: The Quantum Realm and Causality

	•	Scripture: Genesis 1:1 (NWT) - “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.”
	•	Question: If everything needs a cause, what caused Jehovah? If Jehovah doesn’t need a cause, could the universe also be self-caused, perhaps explained by principles in quantum mechanics where particles appear without a clear cause?
	•	Ask Yourself: It’s like someone saying, “Everything needs a birth certificate—except me.” Is this a fair rule, or is there a bit of special pleading involved?

Example 3: The Infinite Regress Problem

	•	Scripture: Psalm 90:2 (NWT) - “Before the mountains were born or you brought forth the earth and the productive land, from everlasting to everlasting, you are God.”
	•	Question: If Jehovah is the first cause and existed “from everlasting,” what stops this line of reasoning from applying to the universe itself? Why must there be a stopping point at God, rather than considering an eternal universe?
	•	Ask Yourself: It’s like saying, “Everything’s on a chain—except the first link.” But why does the first link get a pass? Couldn’t the chain itself be eternal?

6. Ontological Argument Reversed: What Makes a Being “Great”?

Example 1: The Concept of a Perfectly Evil Being

	•	Scripture: Job 1:8-12 (NWT) - Jehovah’s conversation with Satan.
	•	Question: If we can conceive of a perfectly good being, why not a perfectly evil being? Does this mean both must exist, or is the concept of perfection flawed?
	•	Ask Yourself: Imagine a superhero and a supervillain—if one exists, must the other? Or is it all just a comic book?

Example 2: The Notion of Non-Existence as a “Perfection”

	•	Scripture: Isaiah 45:15 (NWT) - Jehovah hides Himself.
	•	Question: Could non-existence be considered a perfection? If so, does this mean the greatest conceivable being might not exist at all?
	•	Ask Yourself: It’s like saying the best pizza is one you never have to eat—because it’s too perfect to be real. Does that make sense?

Example 3: Incoherence of Maximally Great Concepts

	•	Scripture: Deuteronomy 20:16-17 (NWT) - The command to destroy entire populations.
	•	Question: Is the concept of a “maximally great” being coherent? Can a being be all-powerful and all-loving while commanding violence? Is this a logical contradiction?
	•	Ask Yourself: It’s like a superhero who’s both the strongest and the gentlest—but sometimes throws a bus. Can these qualities really coexist?

7. Reverse Arguments from Scripture: Digging Deeper

Example 1: Divine Hiddenness (Isaiah 45:15, NWT)

	•	Question: If Jehovah is a God who hides, how can we have a close relationship with Him? Isn’t it hard to trust someone who’s always just out of sight?
	•	Ask Yourself: It’s like trying to play tag with someone who never stops hiding. Is this a game we can win?

Example 2: Divine Commands (Genesis 22:2, NWT)

	•	Question: If Jehovah’s command to sacrifice Isaac was a test, what does this say about His methods? Can we trust a test that seems so contrary to His nature?
	•	Ask Yourself: It’s like being told to jump out of a plane without a parachute—and then being handed one at the last second. Would you jump with confidence next time?

Example 3: Divine Justice (Job 1:8-12, NWT)

	•	Question: Why would Jehovah allow Satan to test Job so harshly? What does this story tell us about the nature of divine justice and care?
	•	Ask Yourself: It’s like a teacher letting the class bully pick on the star student, just to see if they’ll still be a good student. Is this fair play?

Example 4: Unanswered Prayers (2 Corinthians 12:8-9, NWT)

	•	Question: Why did Jehovah say “no” to Paul’s plea for relief? How do we reconcile this with a loving, responsive God?
	•	Ask Yourself: It’s like asking your boss for a day off and being told, “Actually, you’re working overtime.” How’s that for employee morale?

Example 5: Divine Violence (Deuteronomy 20:16-17, NWT)

	•	Question: How can we reconcile the command to destroy entire populations with the idea of Jehovah’s love and mercy? Is there a different way to understand this?
	•	Ask Yourself: It’s like a neighborhood watch that takes things a bit too far—burning down the whole block to catch one thief. Does this really keep the peace?

Conclusion: Keep It Thoughtful, Keep It Respectful

Engaging with Jehovah’s Witnesses on these topics isn’t about winning a debate—it’s about exploring big questions together. Use these arguments to invite reflection, deepen understanding, and perhaps even share a laugh along the way. Remember, the goal is not to deconstruct someone’s faith but to encourage thoughtful dialogue that respects their beliefs while exploring new perspectives.

Hope this helps! And thank you for making it this far. "

1ex49y3,124,2024-08-20,I thought I would help out the new freshman,u/NeverForgetRowdy,Purdue,https://www.reddit.com/r/Purdue/comments/1ex49y3/i_thought_i_would_help_out_the_new_freshman/,"# I thought it was important for a senior like myself to share all the wisdom I have gained throughout my time here, to ensure every new student has the same level of enjoyment at Purdue that I experienced.

Housing:

We all know Purdue’s housing is not the greatest in the country. Whether it is the packing of freshmen into conference rooms or janitorial closets. Rest assured, the conditions will help build a sense of GRIT™ in you. You can do some things to make your stay in the University Residences. 

Laundry rooms get crowded as everyone has to launder their clothes. Since the washers and dryers are abused by hundreds of thousands of loads in their lifetime, it’s not uncommon for them to become inoperable. I have learned that if you want clean clothes, you have to use the showers and toilets. With all of the free water and lack of a wait, your clothes will be clean in no time. 

Since your clothes will be sopping wet, you will need a way to dry them as quickly as possible. I personally recommend using all the space in your room. This will ensure your clothes can airdry as efficiently as possible. Don’t worry about what your roommate thinks; he or she will understand where you are coming from.

If you get stuck in a room with more friends than you want and just need to get your own place for a while it is not hard to get upgraded to a single. All you have to do is buy some cheap liquor and beer, drink it hard and fast on an empty stomach, then go challenge people to a real-life Rock’em Sock’em Robots match. Someone there will realize your talent and call for a tax-payer-paid ride to an off-campus property where you can spend the night. Quite a steal, in my opinion.

 

Transportation:

Whether you like walking, sprinting, or scootering to class, the Purdue campus is well-suited for your transportation needs. Just keep these tips and tricks in mind. 

If you are walking, you will likely see empty patches of pavement painted like a street. It is a little-known secret that these are pedestrian highways. You can walk in these lanes as they allow you to avoid the crowds between classes. You are even free to stare at your phone as you don’t have to worry about bumping into anyone. It’s truly a great experience.

For the bikers, the advice is much simpler. At Purdue, bicycles are not the same as cars, so we don’t have to follow the same laws like stop signs. Pedal as hard as you can if you are running late for class. The cars will understand.



Dining:

We all know that the dining courts can get overly crowded at normal eating hours. Luckily for you, Purdue stocks its campus with fresh, free-range squirrels. These plump little critters are the perfect snacks for a post-workout protein snack. With a variety of ways to cook ‘em up, there is something for everyone. 

If rodent meat is not your thing, I guess there are some trees you can nibble on. I wouldn’t know, as I love juicy, tender meat.

 

Academics:

Purdue’s curriculum is tough. However, it is important to remember C’s get degrees. Since you are at college you are considered a grown adult. So you can join the rest of the student body and skip lectures. You can choose to do homework if you feel like it. 

If you do decide to complete homework assignments, you should use ChatGPT to help complete them. Not only will it save you time and resources, but you are guaranteed to get a perfect score.

I hope these tips and insights into the culture at Purdue help you feel more at home during your time on campus. "

\[Pitch\] Seeking Co-Founders for an AI-Powered Learning Platform: Revolutionizing Education with AI and Real-World Content



Hello, fellow entrepreneurs, tech enthusiasts, and educators!



I’m excited to share an opportunity to join me in building an innovative AI-powered learning platform designed to revolutionize the way students learn and engage with educational content. This platform merges high-quality, traditional educational content with cutting-edge AI technology, creating a unique hybrid learning experience that bridges the gap between traditional learning methods and the digital future.



The Vision:

Education is evolving rapidly, but there's still a significant gap in the way students are able to access and interact with educational content. While online learning platforms have made strides in making education more accessible, many still rely heavily on static content that doesn’t fully leverage the potential of modern technology. Our platform aims to change that by integrating AI in a way that complements and enhances traditional learning, rather than replacing it.



The platform is designed to offer students a personalized learning experience that adapts to their individual needs and learning styles. By combining real-world content, such as instructional videos and project-based learning, with AI-driven assistance, we aim to provide a comprehensive learning environment where students can not only consume content but also interact with it in a meaningful way.



Core Features of the Platform:

To truly revolutionize education, our platform focuses on several core areas that address the needs of modern learners. These features are designed to enhance the learning experience, provide support where students need it most, and prepare them for the challenges they will face in their academic and professional careers.



1. AI-Assisted Learning:

One of the most innovative aspects of our platform is the integration of AI to assist students in their learning journey. Here’s how it works:



DSA Problem-Solving with AI Hints:



Personalized Assistance: Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) are fundamental to computer science education, but they can be challenging for many students. Our platform provides an AI-driven assistant that can guide students through DSA problems by offering hints tailored to their specific needs. The AI can assess the student’s current understanding and provide suggestions on how to approach the problem, breaking it down into manageable steps.

Interactive Learning: Before jumping into video explanations or solutions, students can engage in a dialogue with the AI. They can ask questions, receive explanations, and even request additional challenges to reinforce their understanding. This interactive approach helps students build confidence and develop problem-solving skills at their own pace.

Code Complexity Analysis: Beyond just solving problems, our AI can also analyze the complexity of the code that students write. It provides insights into the efficiency of their solutions, offering suggestions for optimization and explaining the underlying principles. This feature not only helps students improve their coding skills but also deepens their understanding of algorithmic efficiency, which is crucial for advanced studies and professional development.

Learning Pathways:



Adaptive Learning: The platform tracks student progress and adapts the learning material based on their performance. If a student struggles with a particular concept, the AI will recommend additional resources or simpler problems to build their foundation before moving on to more complex topics.

Goal-Oriented Learning: Students can set learning goals, and the AI will create personalized pathways to help them achieve these goals. Whether it's mastering a specific algorithm, preparing for a coding interview, or completing a project, the platform provides a clear roadmap to success.

2. Project-Based Learning:

We believe that one of the most effective ways to learn is by doing. That’s why our platform emphasizes project-based learning, where students can apply what they’ve learned in practical, real-world scenarios.



AI-Guided Project Development:



Project Outline Creation: One of the biggest challenges students face when starting a project is knowing where to begin. Our AI assists in creating a detailed project outline, helping students identify key objectives, necessary tools, and steps required to complete the project. This guidance ensures that students have a clear direction from the start, reducing the overwhelm that often comes with tackling complex projects.

Feature Prioritization: In any project, some features are more critical than others. Our AI helps students prioritize these features based on the project’s goals and the student’s skill level. By focusing on the most important aspects first, students can ensure that they’re building a strong foundation before moving on to additional features.

Project Baskets: To spark creativity and provide inspiration, we offer curated ""Project Baskets"" – collections of project ideas that students can choose from. These baskets are tailored to different skill levels and areas of interest, ensuring that there’s something for everyone. Whether a student is interested in web development, data science, or mobile app creation, they’ll find a project that aligns with their goals.

Collaborative Learning:



Team Projects: Recognizing the importance of teamwork in the professional world, our platform facilitates collaborative projects. Students can team up with peers to work on larger projects, with the AI providing guidance and managing task delegation. This collaborative approach not only enhances learning but also builds essential soft skills like communication and teamwork.

Peer Review: Students can submit their projects for peer review, receiving constructive feedback from their classmates. This process not only helps improve the quality of their work but also fosters a sense of community and shared learning.

3. AI-Generated Courses:

In addition to providing interactive learning experiences, our platform also offers dynamic, AI-generated courses that cater to the unique needs of each student.



Dynamic Course Content:



Customizable Learning Paths: Using generative AI, our platform can create tailored courses based on a student’s interests, goals, and current knowledge level. Whether a student is a beginner or an advanced learner, the AI will generate a course that meets their specific needs. This personalized approach ensures that students are always challenged but never overwhelmed.

Content Curation: To supplement our AI-generated courses, we employ web scraping techniques to curate related videos and resources from across the web. These resources are seamlessly integrated into the learning experience, providing students with a rich, diverse array of content that enhances their understanding of the subject matter.

Continuous Learning:



Course Updates: The AI continuously monitors changes in the industry and updates course content to reflect the latest trends and technologies. This ensures that students are always learning the most relevant and up-to-date information, preparing them for the ever-evolving job market.

Self-Paced Learning: Recognizing that every student learns at their own pace, our platform offers self-paced courses. Students can progress through the material as quickly or as slowly as they need, with the AI providing additional support or challenges as necessary.

4. Career Preparation Tools:

Beyond academic learning, our platform is designed to prepare students for their future careers by offering a range of tools and resources aimed at enhancing their employability.



Counseling and Mock Interviews:



AI-Powered Counseling: Navigating career choices can be daunting, especially for students who are unsure of their future direction. Our AI-powered counseling service helps students explore their interests, assess their strengths, and identify potential career paths. By analyzing their learning history and preferences, the AI provides personalized advice and resources to guide them towards fulfilling careers.

Mock Interviews: To help students prepare for the job market, our platform offers mock interviews that simulate real-world interview scenarios. These interviews are powered by AI, which can ask questions, evaluate responses, and provide feedback on areas for improvement. This practice helps students build confidence and improve their interview skills, making them better prepared for the competitive job market.

AI Interviews:



Realistic Simulations: Our AI interview feature goes beyond basic mock interviews by simulating more complex, realistic scenarios that students may encounter in actual job interviews. This includes technical interviews, behavioral interviews, and case studies, providing a comprehensive preparation experience.

1ex5wc7,4,2024-08-20,Please help me find a movie from my childhood!,u/Background-Brain6830,kungfucinema,https://www.reddit.com/r/kungfucinema/comments/1ex5wc7/please_help_me_find_a_movie_from_my_childhood/,"I already tried ChatGpt, all it's suggestions were wrong.

Here is what I remember from the plot:

In the beginning, our hero is very weak, can't fight, was adopted by the Master of a kung fu temple. At the kung fu temple, the hero is beaten by the other students, mocked and made fun of. He leaves the temple on a journey, where he finds a cave, falls into a cave, something along those lines. Inside the cave he finds on the walls 12 (i think they were 12, might be more or less) tablets that teach a lost kung fu style. Our hero is the last member of the clan that used that kung fu style and he is the only one able to learn it based only on the tablets in the cave, but he learns only 11 of the 12 tablets. 

Next, our hero becomes stronger that anyone with the new style he just learnt and falls in love with a princess, but also develops an arch enemy along the way. At the end of the movie, the princess is captured by the enemy and to save her, the hero has to vow not to use the overpowered style he just learnt. 

I think the last fight is in the cave where the tablets were. After making the vow, and before the final big battle, The Master from the beginning that adopted him comes to his aid. Our hero reads the 12 tablet, which gives him the ability to learn any kung fu style almost instantly, without a lot of training. He and the Master are attacked by lots of enemies (soldiers of the arch enemy), and The Master teaches our Hero his kung fu style while fighting the foes, our hero being able to learn it just by watching the Master fight, having gained this skill after reading the 12th tablet. 

I remember the movie ending on a cliffhanger, might be a 2nd part somewhere. I was really young, these movies were played on the TV beyond midnight, it was so good that it kept me up and I am able to remember all these details more than 20 years after watching it.

Suggestions made by ChatGPT that were already checked by me and are not it:

*The Buddhist Fist* (1980)

*Shaolin Temple 2: Kids from Shaolin* (1984)

*The 18 Bronzemen* (1976)

*The Secret Rivals 2* (1977)

*The Mystery of Chessboxing* (1979)

I’d appreciate if you tell me a bit about yourself once you message. I’m cool with moving onto a different platform later on."

Fifth year ELA/SS teacher here.

It's PD week in our district. Today, we spent the day gathered as a faculty to review policy and whatnot. One of our AP's got up and flipped to a slide titled ""Student Feedback."" 

Homeboy then proceeds to tell a story from when he was in high school. He wanted more than anything to be an NFL quarterback.  If that didn't work out, he was thinking he'd become a doctor, so he signed up for medical terminology. The teacher was a young woman in her first year, he said.

When it came time for the final, this admin wrote a song with coded lyrics, which he then sang during the exam so his football buddies would do well, too. Apparently the teacher wasn't as naive as he thought, because he got a zero for cheating. 

He then proceeded to tell us that he had no idea singing out answers was cheating because the teacher nEvER SeT ThAt ExPecTatIon. He decided then and there that he would not be a doctor--the teacher crushed his spirit and the medical field lost out on his talent because of her  lack of compassion for him and his buddies 🏈

We were then counseled to try and do a better job of SeTtInG ExPeCTaTiOns on individual assignments and that if instances of academic dishonesty did arise, to reflect on to what degree WE may be responsible for the student's behavior. After all, WE are the professionals designing instruction, so clearly, we did something wrong when a student(s) decide to copy and paste from Google, use ChatGPT, etc.

I am/was flabbergasted. Am I wrong in categorizing this as BS? "

Picture a gym 10 years ago: The weights room was largely a male-dominated space, with women mostly doing cardio exercise. Fast-forward to today and you’re likely to see women of all ages and backgrounds confidently navigating weights equipment. This is more than just anecdotal. According to data from the Australian Sports Commission, the number of women participating in weightlifting (either competitively or not) grew nearly five-fold between 2016 and 2022.

Extreme heat is a silent killer. From time to time, we hear about shocking cases of football players and other athletes who die suddenly while exerting themselves on hot days. Those deaths are certainly tragic, but statistically they are very rare. Most deaths from extreme heat are in older people, who frequently die alone inside their homes. They often die slowly, as the heat creeps up to and sometimes past body temperature, especially when heat domes park themselves over cities and keep the temperature high all day and all night.

1exi98n,1,2024-08-21,Leveraging AI to design AI-proof assignments ,u/LopsidedLevel9009,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1exi98n/leveraging_ai_to_design_aiproof_assignments/,"Considering we have been discussing the difficulties of spotting AI in essays and other assignments, I decided to ask ChatGPT to generate an extensive list of assignments that would make it very difficult for students to use AI to complete without it being noticeable (I also asked it to explain why AI use in each of these would be noticeable, which I can follow up with tomorrow if necessary).

The list it gave me consisted of the following (I'll follow-up tomorrow for any on the list that need clarification) 44 assignment ideas. 

1. Subjective Personal Analysis
2. Multi-Step Argument Development 
3. Real-Time Discussions
4. Reflective Workshops 
5. Original Case Studies 
6. Contextual Adaptation 
7. Cross-Referencing Sources 
8. Self-Assessment Criteria
9. Integration of Feedback 
10. Detailed Research Logs
11. Ethical Considerations 
12. Creative Writing Elements 
13. Customized Problem Statements
14. Comprehensive Reflection on Learning
15. Analysis of Peer Essays
16. Integration of Field Research 
17. Exploration of Personal Values
18. Narrative Evolution
19. Comparative Analysis
20. Individual Problem Solving 
21. Personal Engagement in Research 
22. Use of Personal Data
23. Live Writing Sessions 
24. Reflective Peer Reviews 
25. Evolution of Ideas
26. Customized Essay Sections 
27. Self-Reported Writing Challenges 
28. Personal Impact Statements
29. Examination of Personal Biases
30. Detailed Process Documentation

34. Creative [Multimedia] Integration 
35. Personalized Literature Reviews 
36. Exploration of Unconventional Perspectives 
37. Real-Time Feedback Integration 
38. Custom Research Questions
39. Personal Contribution Statements 
40. Comprehensive Understanding Demonstrations
41. Varied Assignment Formats 
42. Integration of Personal Projects 
43. Personal and Scholarly Balance
44. Detailed Bibliographic Analysis

As you can see, the AI couldn't even stick to just assignment types - it also generated assignment elements that AI struggles to reproduce. 

Having queried the AI extensively, it seems that what AI struggles with the most is contextual adaptation, synthesis of information across sources and disciplines (also known as cross transference), and personalization (emotional depth). 

What would know better than an LLM what AI most struggles with? I figured I might as well ask it. And when I read through the list, I realized I already used several elements (again, it confused types and elements) in assignments that AI struggles to reproduce. We probably all do.

Maybe we can leverage AI to teach us how to get around the workarounds that students have found in order to design AI-proof assignments. I mean, we've all been using workarounds for student workarounds in other mediums for years. This is just the current version of an age-old problem. "

Ready to take your [Skool](https://honeysyed.com/Skool) courses from zero to hero with the magic of ChatGPT? Buckle up, because I’m about to show you how to make your courses not just good, but 10X better! Let’s dive in and have some fun.

𝐖𝐡𝐲 𝐔𝐬𝐞 𝐂𝐡𝐚𝐭𝐆𝐏𝐓?

Before we jump in, let’s chat about why ChatGPT is your new BFF for course creation:

* Speed: Get your content done faster than you can say “syllabus.”
* Quality: With ChatGPT’s vast knowledge, your content will be top-notch.
* Engagement: Create fun and interactive content to keep your students hooked.
* Results: Happy students mean better reviews and more subscriptions. Win-win!

# 𝐒𝐭𝐞𝐩 𝟏: 𝐃𝐞𝐟𝐢𝐧𝐞 𝐘𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐂𝐨𝐮𝐫𝐬𝐞 𝐆𝐨𝐚𝐥𝐬

First things first, let’s figure out what you want to achieve with your course. Ask yourself:

* What’s the main goal here?
* Who are you teaching?
* What should your students walk away knowing?

𝙀𝙭𝙖𝙢𝙥𝙡𝙚 𝙉𝙞𝙘𝙝𝙚𝙨:

• Losing Weight: “Drop Those Pounds Like They’re Hot”

• Goal: Teach effective weight loss strategies.

• Audience: Anyone who’s tired of their pants being too tight.

• Coaching Coaches: “Coach Like a Pro”

• Goal: Help aspiring coaches become better at coaching.

• Audience: Life coaches, business coaches, and that one guy who thinks he’s Tony Robbins.

• Creating Pyramid Schemes: “Build Your Triangle of Success” (Just kidding, don’t do this)

• Goal: Teach the “theoretical” structure of pyramid schemes.

• Audience: Aspiring multi-level marketers with a sense of humor.

**Creating Outlines and Lesson Plans**

𝙋𝙧𝙤𝙢𝙥𝙩 𝙀𝙭𝙖𝙢𝙥𝙡𝙚:

“Hey ChatGPT, make an outline for a module on SEO Basics with key topics and subtopics.”

**Writing Lesson Content**

For each lesson, get ChatGPT to do the heavy lifting.

𝙋𝙧𝙤𝙢𝙥𝙩 𝙀𝙭𝙖𝙢𝙥𝙡𝙚:

“Write a lesson on ‘Keyword Research for SEO,’ covering why it’s important, the tools to use, and how to do it right.”

**Making Quizzes and Activities**

Keep your students engaged with quizzes and activities created by ChatGPT.

𝙋𝙧𝙤𝙢𝙥𝙩 𝙀𝙭𝙖𝙢𝙥𝙡𝙚:

“Create a quiz with 10 questions on ‘Social Media Marketing Best Practices.’ Make it fun and challenging!”

# 𝐒𝐭𝐞𝐩 𝟒: 𝐃𝐞𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐧 𝐘𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐂𝐨𝐮𝐫𝐬𝐞 𝐌𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐚𝐥𝐬

**Visuals and Multimedia**

Even though ChatGPT can’t make images, it can suggest awesome visual ideas.

𝙋𝙧𝙤𝙢𝙥𝙩 𝙀𝙭𝙖𝙢𝙥𝙡𝙚:

“What visuals should I include in a lesson on ‘Email Marketing’? Suggest some infographics, charts, and video ideas.”

**Formatting and Presentation**

Use bold and italic fonts to make your content pop. Skool’s platform makes it easy to add some flair.

𝙀𝙭𝙖𝙢𝙥𝙡𝙚:

* 𝗞𝗲𝘆 𝗣𝗼𝗶𝗻𝘁: Keep your keyword density between 1-2%.
* 𝙋𝙧𝙤 𝙏𝙞𝙥: Use Google Keyword Planner to find the best keywords.

𝙋𝙧𝙤𝙢𝙥𝙩 𝙀𝙭𝙖𝙢𝙥𝙡𝙚:

“Give me a marketing plan to promote my digital marketing course, including social media strategies and email campaigns.”

**Engaging Your Community**

“Suggest weekly engagement activities for my digital marketing community on Skool.”

**Conclusion: Launch and Iterate**

Once your course is live, gather feedback and keep making it better. Update your content regularly to keep it fresh.

I hope you found this helpful. I don't recommend that you just make your entire course using ChatGPT. Remember to only teach what you truly know. BUT, a lot of people have trouble even knowing where to get started, and I wanted to prove that it's possible to do this by simply prompting ChatGPT to make this post and in under 5 minutes, here we are. Now imagine what you can do in an hour, a day, a week...

1expm7u,5,2024-08-21,"AutoLatex - text2latex, img2latex with live-rendering sidebar chrome extension",u/dejavu_kun,deeplearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/deeplearning/comments/1expm7u/autolatex_text2latex_img2latex_with_liverendering/,"Hello r/deeplearning , I made a chrome extension called [AutoLatex](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/fmjogafcialngfcopflagalflkcnlebk) that might be of help to some of you. You can see a demo on the chrome extension page. You would require an Openrouter api key to try the LLMs. It uses Gemini-Flash-1.5 by default for img2latex but you can change to any other models supported by Openrouter.

AutoLatex is a browser extension that simplifies LaTeX equation generation for researchers and students. It uses LLMs to convert natural language and images into markdown and LaTeX, with instant rendering so you can edit on the spot. 

In short, you can do the following 

  
- text/image to equations in markdown+latex  
- live rendering of markdown+latex  
- drag and drop screenshot  
- just a simple chat mode  
- customizable models and default prompts

Why even use AutoLatex over say chatGPT or claude sonnet 3.5 chat

- You can just edit your math latex as well with rendering (no need for LLMs there)

- Ease of access anywhere (don't have to change tab, ctrl + shift + L opens)"

In the past I have had success learning from conversations with ChatGPT.

But now that I have the opportunity to use Custom GPTs, I can't help but think there is a way I could learn more efficiently.

I recently thought about a way to teach vocabulary. 

These days there are many flashcards / repetitive memorization tools such as quiziz, quizlet, anki pro, etc...

The problem is that they all display the same ""question"" / ""flashcard"", which can be really boring and prone to students copying answers from one another.

AI creates brand new opportunities in this field. For example, here is a prompt which I gave Claude, and it's answer. You can see it created 4 questions for the same answer:

\`\`\`  
Create an English Vocabulary test for 10th grade ESL students about the word ""Environment"". The answer for all the questions should be ""Environment"". Include 2 Single-Choice questions and 2 Complete the sentence questions. The answers themselves should be simplified to the level of a 10th grader, and match their knowledge. Here is the test:



Here is an English Vocabulary test about the word ""Environment"" for 10th grade ESL students:

Single-Choice Questions:

1. The place where a person, animal, or plant lives is called the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. a. System b. Weather c. Environment d. Climate
2. The things around us, both living and non-living, that we interact with is called the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. a. Sea b. Sand c. Space d. Environment

Complete the Sentence Questions:

1. The \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ includes all the natural things like air, water, and land that living things need to survive.
2. Keeping the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ clean and healthy is important for all living things.

1. c. Environment
2. d. Environment
3. Environment
4. Environment

Let's say we create one personalized question per each student in our classroom using AI. We can adjust the difficulty of the question by adjusting our prompt, and I believe we can track our student's growth and classroom knowledge more efficiently and accurately using this method.

1exym7n,212,2024-08-21,No longer a fan of Three Houses Recruitment ,u/NatHarmon11,fireemblem,https://www.reddit.com/r/fireemblem/comments/1exym7n/no_longer_a_fan_of_three_houses_recruitment/,"Basically the name of the title. After playing 3H for the longest time and messing around with recruitment just don’t like it as much as I used to. I think it was a neat idea to be able to recruit other students from a different house in theory and having it based off of stats and support rank. Just after while and seeing how recruited worked happened in Three Hopes I just don’t like it anymore. I don’t like just being able to just take all of the students away from the house they are suppose to be in because it’s their nation plus just takes away facing them in the field of battle as well. Like you can take all but Hubert away from Edelgard, you can take everyone but Dedue away from Dimitri and you can just leave Claude all alone. I don’t like that narratively. I prefer how it’s done in Three Hopes where it happens during the war phase of the game, you recruit someone by giving them mercy in battle and letting them join your side and only certain characters join like Lorenz joining up with the Black Eagles because his father turned on the Alliance to join the Empire. Petra joining with Dimitri so Brigad can be free from Empire rule. Like I don’t really see story wise why some people would leave during the academy phase, why not just have it exclusive to the War Phase plus I can see why Felix would join with the Black Eagles but not Golden Deer same with Lorenz, I can see him join Black Eagles but not Blue Lions. On top of that even tho it’s pretty funny why does Slyvain leave his childhood friends just because his teacher is a girl like really??. 

Of course this is just my nitpick I know people like to be able to recruit all of their favorites even if they don’t use them. I know people just like to recruit every single character. I know for Maddening it’s important to recruit certain character just because of the item they can give you through their paralogue on top of just getting the best units in the game. It’s really just a me issue.

TL:DR I wish Three Houses recruitment worked like Three Hopes recruitment"
1exyyqr,3,2024-08-21,C States Idle Crashes,u/mathm3do,homelab,https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/1exyyqr/c_states_idle_crashes/,"Hi guys! I am quite new to the homelab thing and I really enjoy it. I have some basic experience with linux (ubuntu), docker etc. I am running some containers such as nextcloud etc on my pc build and exploring machine learning with ollama. Everything is fine so far, but the c states cause crashes.

# The actual problem and my goal 

My pc build seems – at least to me – quite robust (see below), but when I activate c states in the BIOS settings, the pc crashes – at frist glance randomly – under rather low loads, sometimes during heavier loads. See below for some information and outputs.

I am wondering if there is a reasonable solution to this problem or if I have to live with the fact, that system needs upt to 50-60W when just on idle. I need this system to actually run 24/7, I could do some jumper server stuff with startup at 5 am, shutdown at 0 am etc. But I think that there needs to be another solution. Actually I could get a less power hungry cpu if not a new system. 

What dou you thing about proxmox? Will I have the same issues? With Ubuntu 24.04 I had the same issues and thought the problem is related to NVIDIA and some incompatibility. It was not.

I built such a powerful system to be able to run some llm and diffusion models. I am an arts, math and programming teacher at a german high school. I do also give lectures at university in art education. I want my students at high school to discover and learn with these systems safely (germans take privacy quite serious ;-) ), and for my students at university I am trying to build something more flexible. I do also run a jupyterhub for some colleagues and students. In addition I am using a large hdd as a private archive.

Great thanks in advance!

Ahmet

# What i tried so far

* I googled and read some articles and forum posts. Some of them just suggest to disable c states “for sanity”, most of them use desktop systems for gamers.
* I made some BIOS updates, this did not help. A kernel (hwe) upgrade did not help either (see uprecords).
* I contacted Gigabyte, they gave me some advice (XMP etc, disabled). At the same time, I found out that it could work fine, when I disable c states. This helped, 8 days without any crash but high power consumption.
* I contacted ALTERNATE, where I bought the pc components. They explained to me that they only test with Windows. It would take about 2 weeks to run all tests, this is a bit long. I actually do not think that it is a hardware issue.
* I used the intel RMA, the new CPU was sent to me today, I tested, encountered the same problem and decided to try to solve it with you folks.
* Disconnecting the hdd does not help.

# Some outputs

## uprecords: history of some crashes

Please note how some entries show a uptime of full hours. My guess is that there is some system state, which would tell the system, that it could change to a certain c state, what then causes a crash.

```shell
uprecords -Bm 50

1ey0d84,1,2024-08-21,Need Advice for Career Goals,u/figaro_cat,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ey0d84/need_advice_for_career_goals/,"I graduated from university in 2018 with a Bachelor of Arts in International Development Studies. I had made the mistake of not really researching the local job market before choosing my major. Since I like outside the national capital, there are very few jobs in Canada in my field. Since graduation, I have dabbled in teaching ESL to try to find a career path for going abroad. I worked for a year and a half and saved up enough money to spend \~10 months abroad. But I came back with a drained bank account and problems re-adjusting to living in Canada.

That was three years ago and I have been unemployed since. I have been trying to think of a pathway for eventually going abroad again, since that is what makes me truly happy. (i.e. having deep, life-changing cross-cultural conversations with people of all sorts and exploring really old and interesting places) I have been consulting different career counsellors and I eventually came up with a plan to get into curriculum development. The problem is that I found out I couldn't make it as an ESL teacher (too shy and softspoken) and the curriculum job required a Bachelor of Education and likely working as a teacher for a period of time. As a result, I'm not interested in that anymore.

I am currently trying to decide between two options:

1) A Bachelor of Social Work - This is another back up plan. Except I don't even know if this would allow me to go abroad. There are lots of jobs locally for this so I wouldn't be in the same situation upon graduation with more education. I'm not sure my heart is in it but the courses seem easy and I know I would do well.

2) A Bachelor of Arts in Psychology - If I didn't have to worry about money and didn't fear failure, I would choose this option. I choose International Development because it allowed me to study all the different subjects that interested me. But there was an idea for graduate studies that has stuck with me that I would be really disappointed if I couldn't pursue at some point in my life.

My problem is that I only have about two years of coverage left in student loans and would need to know for sure I could work at the end of the bachelors, with the intention of saving money to do graduate studies. (I currently live at home with my mom and sister and am unemployed. I volunteer helping newcomers find resources and edit their resumes and cover letters.)

I asked chatgpt what I could do locally with International Development/Psychology and I got the following: Community Development Worker, Program Coordinator for the Non-Profit Sector, Policy Analyst or Researcher, Research and Evaluation Specialist, and Newcomer Support Worker.

My research idea has to do with whether the ability to exploit others for financial gain is a learned or inherent human behaviour. I plan to experiment with children during my masters and with adults for a phd, if I get that far. I have pitched my idea to people of different educational and cultural backgrounds and they have all told me that I could have an excellent career. (I just don't believe in myself.)

Would someone mind talking things out with me? I would greatly appreciate it."
1ey25fl,1,2024-08-21,Not so scared of ChatGPT now,u/journoprof,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1ey25fl/not_so_scared_of_chatgpt_now/,"Needing tons of questions to build large item banks, I set up a ChatGPT account to help. We're suppose to be taking advantage of AI to teach better, you know?

I kept it simple: Say, 10 sentences following a specific style guide's rule. It worked OK ... for the first and second sets of questions. Then it seemed to make up its own rules. Finally, I just had it generate raw material, such as 10 sentences including ages, and adjusted them to fit the style guide. It managed that, with occasional hiccups.

Language is tough. So instead I had it generate sets of word problems with whole-number answers for things such as mean and median averages. It even showed its work, and the final calculations were fine.

I had students beta test with random questions. Every student who got one of the math problems was marked wrong on at least one answer.

Suspicious, I took one of the word problems and fed it back into ChatGPT. This time, it generated answers that weren't whole numbers. Thinking perhaps I had mistyped when I entered the questions into my quiz, I fiddled with the numbers until ChatGPT said I was back to whole numbers. Great!

Only, as I was changing the question and answers, I realized the AI said the mean average of a set of numbers was lower than all the numbers in the set. This seemed unlikely. The error was in the most basic math: when it added up the seven numbers in the set, it got an answer that was wrong in two of the three digits. (Did the division after that jim-dandy, though.) Upon further review, it had screwed up almost every word problem's math in some way.

It seems ChatGPT is terrible at simple tasks. And the one student I dinged in a previous course for using AI was embarrassingly easy to catch -- bizarre citations, a fictitious central incident, etc. Are the current fears about AI in education overblown? Is it really sneaking through? It may be OK at knowing 2+2=4, but it thought 22+25+22+29+24+25+22=147.

No passion for computers, algorithms, programming, technologies, etc. They use ChatGPT for EVERY single assignment they get, make zero projects on their free time, cheat off all exams, and overall have no interest in computer science. Throughout my career I’ve only encountered a small handful of people who truly had a love for computer science. It’s really discouraging to continue studying this field when most of the students are only in it for the money. 

So here’s the question. How do you guys box these people out of your thoughts? Its so hard for me learn new frameworks and technologies 
when most of my peers could care less about learning anything. Kinda gives the CS field a bad reputation. I feel the field isn’t as prestigious as it once was. "

1eyb9v8,74,2024-08-22,I started a food stall,u/Kaya_ko_2,BusinessPH,https://www.reddit.com/r/BusinessPH/comments/1eyb9v8/i_started_a_food_stall/,"I'm a 22F and a college student, selling sandwiches at my school. That's when I first started, I'd bring just enough stock at the morning and would go around my campus selling my products. I sell a lot more when there's an event happening at the school. 

Minsan naman nagchachat muna ako sa mga suki ko, asking if they're gonna order and how many. I don't post my products at our fb group, I just relied on word of mouth and kept close contact sa mga suki ko. 

Then as time went on, I saved enough to build my first physical store. It was also thanks to my parents who supported and helped me established it. Nung una ang plano ko lang tlga ibenta is burgers and fries, since masyadong namamahalan yung tao sa place namin dun sa sandwiches ko. That's why we switched to burgers and fries, and added a few drinks. 

We officially opened during ber-ber months, and super tumal tlga noon, like 1 or 3 customers lang ako per day. Medyo pinanghihinaan nako ng loob nun pero I pushed thru. We added a few rice meals and promo deals to our menu and I created a fb page (https://www.facebook.com/FrydaysBacoor?mibextid=ZbWKwL) to boost our sales. Wala ako alam sa socmed marketing kaya nahihirapan ako pagdating sa content creation and stuff. 

Nagaral ako sa yt about marketing and with the help of a few friends, chatgpt and canva. Maayos nman yung mga na post namin. Ayun simula nun dumadami na ang customers namin and we even have days puno kami ng orders and delivery. 

Almost 1 year na kaming open and even though andaming ups and downs na nangyari, I'm glad I went thru all those kasi kung hindi, I wouldn't learn and grow. Change is constant, you have to learn to adapt to your surroundings in order to survive and thrive. You also have to remember that, you can't do everything yourself, sabi nga nila no man is an island. Handling a business is not easy and it can take a toll on your physical, mental and emotional health Kaya it's best to ask people who you trust for help para hindi mo salo lahat nung problema. 

I learned the hard way that if you're not physically and emotionally fit to work sobrang maapektuhan business mo. I'm just glad that I have my partner, friends and family's support along my journey. I also like to add that one of the most important factor is perseverance. I wouldn't have last this long if I give up that easily, I'm glad na hindi ako nagpadala sa sinabi ng iba at sa mga negative thoughts ko. 

So that's my story, I think medyo kulang and hindi ko na explain ng ayos hehehe Peace. I'd happily answer any of your questions if naguluhan kau. 
I tried to keep it short pero anhaba na pala.😁"
1eybe0c,1,2024-08-22,"Large Language Models: Evolution, Impact, and Future Potential in AI",u/jhkinfotech2021,u_jhkinfotech2021,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_jhkinfotech2021/comments/1eybe0c/large_language_models_evolution_impact_and_future/,"# Definition and Overview

Large Language Models (LLMs) are complex AI models that can comprehend, create, and manipulate human speech at an advanced level. Using transformer technology, these models are built with deep learning methods that empower them to analyze the massive corpus of text data to generate responses mimicking humans. LLMs are pre-trained on large, diverse datasets that enable them to capture subtle language patterns and context-specific understanding or even domain knowledge.

[Large language model Ai](https://preview.redd.it/59narping5kd1.jpg?width=7730&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d7c3df6314717efd0cb4a55904d57c6ca6b64cd5)

The LLM read by predicting the following word of textual content or finishing some given text group known as OpenAI has found out how to get previous that paywall. They can form coherent paragraphs, answer questions (and list the context required to understand them), summarize long documents in < 280 characters or less and they are acting as gatekeepers by translating languages for us — oh, have I told you that all these use cases mentioned also started turning into engaging conversations? GPT-3, GPT-4, and others are examples of Large Language Models (LLMs) that demonstrate the capabilities of these systems for natural language processing.

# Context of history and evolution

The creation of Large Language Models is a breakthrough in the history of artificial intelligence. Long ago the journey started with early language models like n-grams and progressed we got neural networks, which led to basic RNNs (recurrent neural networks), LSTMs, etc. However, the earlier model was not performant when it came to managing long-range dependencies and large datasets.

That game changer was the transformer architecture which was published in 2017: Attention is All You Need by Vaswani et al. The parallelizability of input data for the transformer model enabled more efficient training on big datasets and gave rise to bigger and better language models.

OpenAI made its debut in 2018 with GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), the first big leap in LLMs. A model called GPT-2 released in 2019 presents state-of-the-art language generation abilities and creates tremendous excitement (and controversy) in the ML community. This evolution was furthered still with the release of GPT-3 in 2020, widely recognized for its ability to assemble text that is highly coherent and contextually accurate.

Several large language models (LLM) variations have been developed since then, like BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), T5(Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer), and others. Every reiteration of them has continued to expand the state-of-the-art in terms of how far AI can be pushed with regards to language understanding and generation, culminating most recently into this new age where when we say communication through an AI — it makes sense.

# Current AI and Importance

Language Models with Large Contextual Proximity have played an essential role in the landscape of AI technology, significantly improving how machines interact with human language. They are important for the multitude of domains in which they can perform a whole range of tasks from business to healthcare, education, and recreation.

LLMs in business similarly have many applications for [customer support chatbots](https://www.jhkinfotech.com/blog/all-about-artificial-intelligence), automated content creation, and data analysis aimed to augment productivity while lowering operational costs. In healthcare, they can help improve medical documentation and patient communication while offering the ability to conduct research by studying vast amounts of medical literature. For education, LLMs offer individualized student learning experiences & automated grading and translation of language.

Furthermore, LLMs have a significant impact on AI since they act as basic models for the coming generation of more particular specialized applications of AI. Due to their ability to learn from large datasets and generalize across a different task, they prove useful in accelerating research and development of AI.

However, the promise of LLMs hits important ethical and societal considerations — the potential for misuse, problems with bias in those legal decisions that are biased to begin with, and questions surrounding their impact on employment. These are ongoing big issues for how to make such models safe and good at being used in society.

In conclusion, Large Language Models are a step change enhancement in AI technology both for good and bad. As they continue to develop into a myriad of fields, their relevance in the future of AI is only going up."

>So my boss F24 is going to leave to start her career as a teacher. I've been working with her for 2 years now and I absolutely love her, as a person as well as a boss.

1eyovaz,11,2024-08-22,"Four ""foreign exchange student OCs"" as a ""writing experiment""",u/FourStrandsOfRope,FireEmblemThreeHouses,https://www.reddit.com/r/FireEmblemThreeHouses/comments/1eyovaz/four_foreign_exchange_student_ocs_as_a_writing/,"Greetings. As I mentioned a while back in this subreddit, I was thinking of creating four ""foreign exchange student OCs"" as a ""writing experiment"" to see if I could do it. They're from Albinea, Dagda, Morfis, and Sreng.

Now, on to the OCs:

**RECRUITMENT:**

Garreg Mach Monastery starts a ""Foreign Exchange Student Program""; they send four background students to foreign countries, and in exchange a student from each country comes to Garreg Mach.

The foreign exchange students are a male commoner from Albinea, a female commoner from Dagda, a male noble from Morfis, and a female noble from Sreng.

The foreign exchange students are hosted in the building east of the Cemetery and Knight's Hall (same building as Garreg Mach staff), which was previously inaccessible.

It ""unlocks"" at the same time as Abyss.

Recruitment requirements are as follows:

--if you're teaching the Black Eagles, the Srengian can be recruited right away. Otherwise, you need ""C in any skill and 15 in any stat.""

--if you're teaching the Blue Lions, the Albinean can be recruited right away. Otherwise, you need ""C in any skill and 15 in any stat.""

--if you're teaching the Golden Deer, the Morfisan can be recruited right away. Otherwise, you need ""C in any skill and 15 in any stat.""

--the Dagdan can be recruited right away regardless of which class you're teaching.

Explanation:

--even though Sreng borders Faerghus, the Srengian doesn't like Faerghus due to their long history of border conflict, and Adrestia appeals to her more.

--even though Albinea is northwest of Adrestia, the Albinean prefers Faerghus because they both have cultures of chivalry and knighthood, though in different ways.

--Morfis is southeast of Leicester and Almyra, and the Morfisan appreciates how Leicester and Almyra share some cultural traits in common with Morfis.

--the Dagdan was sheltered as a child to protect her from the Dagda and Brigid war, and initially knows very little about Fodlan, so Fodlan is ""all the same to her.""

**HYSEBERHT KIRKHAM - OC FROM ALBINEA**

Name meaning: 

--Hyseberht is an Old English name; hyse means ""warrior, young man"" and berht means ""bright, shiny"".

--Kirkham is a surname that means ""church"" and ""homestead"" and is also the name of some towns in England.

Gender: Male

Commoner or Noble: Commoner, but will eventually earn a Noble title through service in his endings

Age: roughly the same ""age group"" as all the FE3H students and Cyril (I can't decide on an exact number)

Appearance:

--either a younger, student-aged version of Orlando Bloom's Will Turner, or a younger, student-aged version of Cary Elwes' Robin of Loxley, I can't decide which

--hair and eye color are brown

Voice: Brian Blessed, as this character's meant to be a Large Ham like Arthur from Fire Emblem Fates, only British, and the British actor Brian Blessed fits the bill

Preferred Class Line: Noble, Soldier/Monk, Cavalier/Priest, Paladin/Bishop, Holy Knight

Personal Skill: Surprisingly Sincere Faith, gets 2x White Magic Uses even if he's not in the Bishop class, so when combined with him learning every single offensive White Magic spell, he's designed to be ""a unit that actually makes good use of the Holy Knight class's innate White Tomefaire"".

Boons: Lance, Faith, Riding

Banes: Brawling, Heavy Armor

Budding Talent: Reason, if mastered, becomes a Boon and learns ""Seal Magic"" a la Flayn

Country of Albinea:

--Albinea is named after Albion, the oldest known name of Great Britain, so that's why my Albinean OC Hyseberht Kirkham speaks with a British accent

--however, Albinea is a cold and snowy land, even more freezing than Faerghus

--yet it also has very rare flora and fauna, so while survival is difficult, there are uniquely delicious fruits to gather and unique game to hunt for meat

--thus, life in Albinea has a very strong ""anti-nihilist"" worldview: life can be difficult and harsh, but there is happiness to be found if you look for it

--this is also reflected in how the Knights of Albinea are different from Faerghan Knights: instead of ""celebrating death"", the Knights of Albinea ""celebrate life"" and merriment, so they behave more comedically and raucously, enjoy good food and good wine and good company (like Tolkien's Hobbits), and try to make people happy

--but there's a trade-off: this also means the Knights of Albinea are significantly less ""disciplined"" than Faerghan Knights; they're not very good at combat and they don't train nearly as often as they should, plus they don't have enough men to be a good fighting force (for example, they're running short on healers)

--in fact, the only reason they haven't been conquered by Adrestia is because Adrestian nobility considers the place ""so cold you'd have to be nuts to actually live there"", so the Empire hasn't bothered trying to conquer them. (Ordinary Adrestian citizens have a more positive view; it's just the nobility that looks down on Albinea, and we already know Adrestian nobility is corrupt so their opinion should be taken with a grain of salt.)

Personality and background:

--Hyseberht Kirkham is a lot like Arthur from Fire Emblem Fates, only British, as he acts like a comedic and over-the-top knight, so at first he comes across like a character out of Monty Python and the Holy Grail, a British comedy movie.

--But like Arthur, his supports reveal him to be a LOT more serious about his ideals than the observer might think, as he honestly wants to bring happiness and justice to everyone.

--He grew up on a farm in a village with a church, but the village was known for its hospitality, so the Knights of Albinea would occasionally stop there to rest after campaigns, and he grew up idolizing them.

--He noticed that they were short on healers, so as he grew up, he started attending church to develop his Faith so he could be of use to the Knights of Albinea after he joins them one day.

--Then, when Albinea joined the Foreign Exchange Student Program, Hyseberht won the spot to be sent to Garreg Mach because he was the most dedicated student.

--His goal at the start when you first recruit him is to learn discipline and combat skills from Faerghus and Fodlan in general, so that when he graduates school and is able to join the Knights of Albinea, he'll be able to ""combine the best of both Faerghan and Albinean knighthoods"".

Romantic Paired Endings With:

Byleth, Dimitri, Caspar, Bernadetta, Dorothea, Dedue, Ashe, Sylvain, Mercedes, Annette, Ingrid, Raphael, Marianne, Hilda, Leonie, Flayn, Cyril, Jeritza, Yuri, Balthus, Constance, Hapi

(However, regarding pairing Dimitri and Hyseberht, as with the Dimitri/Felix ending, Dimitri does still enter a ""political marriage"" to ensure an heir for the crown, but the resulting queen isn't bothered by Dimitri and Hyseberht finding happiness together.)

Platonic Paired Endings With:

Felix, Seteth, Hanneman, Manuela, Gilbert, Alois, Catherine, Shamir, Anna

No Paired Endings With:

Edelgard, Claude, Hubert, Ferdinand, Linhardt, Petra, Lorenz, Ignatz, Lysithea, Rhea, Sothis

**CAOIMHE WHELAN - OC FROM DAGDA**

Name meaning:

--Caoimhe is an Irish name meaning ""dear, beloved, gentle"", though you pronounce it ""Keeva""

--Whelan is an Anglicization of the Irish surname ""O Faolain"", or ""descendant of Faolan"", and Faolan means ""little wolf""

Gender: Female

Commoner or Noble: Commoner, but will eventually earn a Noble title through service in her endings

Age: roughly the same ""age group"" as all the FE3H students and Cyril (I can't decide on an exact number)

Appearance:

--a bit like Irish actress Stephanie McKeon's performance as Anna from Frozen

--red hair, green eyes, freckles, and wears glasses

Voice: Irish actress Rebecca O'Mara's performance as Caitlin from Thomas and Friends

Preferred Class Line: Commoner, Monk, Mage/Priest, Warlock/Bishop, War Cleric

Personal Skill: Like a Gentle Breeze, gets Black Magic Avoid +20 and White Magic Avoid +20 regardless of what class she's in, so when combined with Brawl Avoid +20 by mastering War Cleric, and given her high Strength/Magic/Dexterity/Speed growths, she's designed to be a ""unit who actually makes good use of the War Cleric class""

Boons: Brawling, Reason, Faith

Banes: Heavy Armor, Riding

Budding Talent: Bow, if Mastered, becomes a Boon and learns ""Waning Shot"" a la Mercedes, so she can be even more of an anti-mage unit

Country of Dagda:

--Dagda is the great god of Irish mythology, so Dagda is based on Ireland

--according to Wikipedia, Ireland consists of several mountains surrounding a plain with rivers going inland, with lush vegetation

--and in real life, much of Ireland was woodland until the end of the Middle Ages, so here in FE3H, Dagda also has lots of woodland surrounding its cities

Personality and Background:

--the Dagda and Brigid War occurred in 1175, while Caoimhe was still a child, and the main FE3H game takes place in 1180, when Caoimhe is in the same ""age group"" as the FE3H students and Cyril

--in order to protect her from the war, her parents deliberately sheltered her, choosing to homeschool her instead of sending her to public school

--now that things are safe in the present, Caoimhe's parents have allowed her to sign up for the foreign exchange program so she can be re-introduced to the world

--this has left Caoimhe with a ""constantly curious"" personality, she likes all of Fodlan's three countries equally, and asks lots of questions about all of them

--the ""joke"" of Caoimhe's character, as it were, is that she behaves like ""an isekai protagonist without actually being isekai'd"" since she was born in the FE world

--which means sometimes she fangirls over the other characters, or expresses outrage at things like Bernadetta's abusive father or Miklan's abusive treatment of Sylvain, etc.

--because of her sheltered childhood, she's a lot more optimistic than some of the other characters, and she tends to let negative feelings pass like a gentle breeze

--she came to Fodlan out of curiosity for what the three Fodlan countries are like, and also so she could experience more of the world after being protected from war

Romantic Paired Endings With:

Byleth, Edelgard, Dimitri, Claude, Hubert, Ferdinand, Linhardt, Caspar, Bernadetta, Dorothea, Petra, Felix, Ashe, Sylvain, Mercedes, Annette, Ingrid, Lorenz, Raphael, Ignatz, Lysithea, Marianne, Hilda, Leonie, Flayn, Cyril, Shamir, Jeritza, Yuri, Balthus, Constance, Hapi

So basically, ""Every single student plus Cyril, Shamir, and Jeritza.""

This is mostly to keep up the ""like an isekai protagonist joke"" of this character.

This makes Caoimhe the only OC to get a romantic ending with a Knight of Seiros, because both Shamir and Caoimhe are Dagdans and have common ground.

(And regarding Lysithea, >!yes, Caoimhe can cure her.!<)

Platonic Paired Endings With:

Seteth, Hanneman, Manuela, Gilbert, Alois, Catherine, Anna

No Paired Endings With:

Rhea, Sothis

**MUZAFFAR SHALABI - OC FROM MORFIS**

Name meaning:

--Muzaffar means ""The Victorious"" in Arabic

--Shalabi is a surname meaning ""handsome; a dandy"" (my OC's described as handsome in-universe, and a dandy is a well-dressed man, and this OC dresses stylishly)

Gender: Male

Commoner or Noble: Noble, as his father is a Sheikh, or a lord who governs a particular territory

Age: roughly the same ""age group"" as all the FE3H students and Cyril (I can't decide on an exact number)

Appearance:

--a younger, student-aged version of Alexander Uloom, who is an Iraqi-American actor

--however, Muzaffar's skin color is darker, like that of Fogado from Fire Emblem Engage

--hair and eye color are black, and he wears glasses

Voice: a bit like Prince Naveen from Disney's The Princess and the Frog, only with the accent changed to an Iraqi accent

Preferred Class Line: Myrmidon/Monk, Mercenary/Mage, Swordmaster/Warlock, Mortal Savant

Personal Skill: Will to Victory, all ""class growth penalties"" are converted into ""class growth boosts"", so the ordinary -10% speed growth penalty of Mortal Savant is now converted into a +10% speed growth boost, and combined with his high Strength and Magic growths plus learning a unique magical sword combat art, he's designed as a ""unit who can actually make good use of the Mortal Savant class""

Boons: Sword, Reason, Authority

Banes: Lance, Axe

Budding Talent: Flying, if mastered, becomes a Boon and learns ""Darting Blow"" a la Jeritza

Country of Morfis:

--according to the thread at [https://www.reddit.com/r/FireEmblemThreeHouses/comments/17ryqyj/on\_the\_matter\_of\_morfis\_sreng\_and\_albinea/](https://www.reddit.com/r/FireEmblemThreeHouses/comments/17ryqyj/on_the_matter_of_morfis_sreng_and_albinea/) posted by Dredd-Pirate-Robert, Morfis takes a lot of inspiration from 9th-century Baghdad, the center of the Islamic Golden Age

--so, Morfis looks like a magnificent Islamic Golden Age city surrounded by a desert, although I imagine there's more to Morfis than just that city, the city is just the part of Morfis that's familiar to Fodlan

Personality and Background:

--Muzaffar's father is a Sheikh, or a lord who governs a particular territory, but Morfis is ambitious and wishes to aim even higher

--his lifelong goal is to become an Emir for either the Sultan or the Caliph of Morfis

--Emir comes from the word ""command"", and can mean either a military commander or prince, it's the highest title a regular citizen can earn on the king's court

--the Sultan is the highest ""civil authority"", like a king, and the Caliph is the highest ""religious authority"", considered a successor to Muhammad

--so, Muzaffar's lifelong goal is to become a commander working for either the Sultan or the Caliph (which one he works for depends on which paired ending he gets)

--however, like Scrooge McDuck, Muzaffar insists on ""making it square""; he is ambitious and wishes to increase his power and wealth, but insists on doing so HONESTLY

--and also, like Scrooge McDuck, Muzaffar also craves the ""adventure"" as much as the position itself

--so, Muzaffar's personality is like a younger, student-aged, more pleasant and friendly Scrooge McDuck

--he came to Fodlan specifically so he could increase his power and knowledge to fulfill his goal of becoming an Emir for Morfis's Sultan or Caliph

**GUNILLA AF KLINTBERG - OC FROM SRENG**

Name meaning:

--Gunilla is a Swedish variant of the name ""Gunhild"", which itself comes from the Old Norse name Gunnhildr, from ""gunnr"" (war) and ""hildr"" (battle)

--""af"" is the Swedish nobility marker, corresponding to the German ""von""

--Klintberg means ""cliff mountain"" in Swedish, and ""af Klintberg"" is a Swedish noble family from the province of Scania (and also a famous folklorist's surname)

Gender: Female

Commoner or Noble: Noble, as Gunilla's father is a Baron, so she was born to a noble family in Sreng

Age: roughly the same ""age group"" as all the FE3H students and Cyril (I can't decide on an exact number)

Appearance:

--like a younger, student-aged version of Kirsten Dunst, who is an American actress of Swedish descent

--blonde hair and blue eyes, is a ""blonde woman in heavy armor"" like Jade from Fire Emblem Engage, only she wears her hair shoulder-length instead of a ponytail

Voice: Melissa Altro, a Canadian voice actress who provided the voice for the cartoon adaptation of Swedish heroine Pippi Longstocking

---though of course she would sound older here, as Gunilla is FE3H-student-aged so she's older than Pippi

Personal Skill: Thrives Under Pressure, Base Movement is always 8 regardless of what class she's in (so even the armored classes can move like a Paladin, Bow Knight, Falcon Knight, or Wyvern Lord), when combined with the fact that she learns good lance and axe combat arts like Vengeance and Diamond Axe, she's designed as a ""unit who can actually make good use of the Great Knight class""

Boons: Lance, Axe, Heavy Armor

Banes: Reason, Faith

Budding Talent: Riding, if mastered, becomes a Boon and learns ""Pass"" a la Bernadetta and Anna

Country of Sreng:

--according to a comment posted by jord839 at the thread [https://www.reddit.com/r/FireEmblemThreeHouses/comments/17ryqyj/on\_the\_matter\_of\_morfis\_sreng\_and\_albinea/](https://www.reddit.com/r/FireEmblemThreeHouses/comments/17ryqyj/on_the_matter_of_morfis_sreng_and_albinea/), Sreng seems to be based off Scandinavian Vikings

--plus, Sreng is described in lore as a wasteland but with pockets of desert

--so, I've decided that Sreng's environment looks sort of like Fallout New Vegas, but with Swedish buildings and natural environments instead of American

--thus, while Sreng is a wasteland as described in lore, it still looks very beautiful, like a ""cross between Sweden and Fallout New Vegas""

Personality and Background:

--Gunilla was born to a noble family, so her life wasn't quite as hard as other Srengians, as she wasn't personally caught up in the border dispute with Faerghus

--but her life of privilege grew boring to her, as she seeks ""challenges"" above all else.

--Gunilla's the sort of person who would climb a mountain simply because it is there, as she gets her greatest thrills in life out of ""doing something difficult"".

--she came to Fodlan to begin with because she wants to challenge herself by seeking new opponents and challenges

(And regarding Lysithea, >!no, Gunilla can't cure her like either Caoimhe or Muzaffar can, so their paired ending just has them make the best of the time they have.!<)

Platonic Paired Endings With:

Claude, Sylvain, Seteth, Hanneman, Manuela, Gilbert, Alois, Catherine, Shamir, Anna

Gunilla's ending with Sylvain is platonic because not only does Sreng have a long history of conflict with the Gautiers, but Sylvain isn't her type. However, in this paired ending she still enters a ""political marriage"" with him, just for the sheer ""challenge"" of ""attempting to negotiate a ceasefire between Sreng and Gautier.""

Basically I'm curious what I should do at this point and thought it would be fun to ask the witches and wizards of Reddit instead of ChatGPT (again) for any advice...   
  
Background info:   
Age: 40

Relationship Status: Single, no kids/never married - always assumed I'd have found someone I loved enough and who loved me enough that I would have started a family by now, but that hasn't really happened. I've had some fun relationships though, but nothing that lasted

  
Primary Profession so far: Animation (Halo games for Bungie, then 343 Industries/Microsoft)  
Secondary Profession(s): Photography, Game Design/Creative Development (SKY FOLK)  
Bio: I went to a small art school for college and got a BFA and a pile ($300k) of student loan debt (paid off now). I excelled as an animator in the game industry for 16-ish years after graduating college and really enjoyed that until about 2015, then progressively felt like I was grinding it out until 2023, it was a hard job to leave because I got to work with my best friend every day making fun video games but there was a nagging feeling like I wanted to do ""more"" than animation, I learned how to write some code, learned how to make games on my own, expanded my skillset into 3d modeling/sculpting, painting, 3d printing, photography, UX design, etc.... Anyway, I should have though left the job earlier because I think I'm dealing with some kind of epic burnout after over-staying. 

I have been trying to figure out how to pursue new interests/paths and have started a few new projects: a remote AAA game co-dev studio, a web design and automation/ai agency and an automated local newspaper (to replace the loss of our small town's local news to national media corps). They are all to some degree launched or close to launched, but my heart just doesn't have a big enough ""cause"" that it can dig into or something. What do people do when they get to this place in life?  Any advice/feedback/ideas of any kind really would be appreciated.

1eyus65,1,2024-08-22,More Thought On AI and Capital: Buy nVidia,u/HardDriveGuy,StrategicStocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/StrategicStocks/comments/1eyus65/more_thought_on_ai_and_capital_buy_nvidia/,"I think I spotted a trend in AI that nobody is tracking, and it is just crazy.  If I'm right, then we should all be ploughing money into nVidia.

I was reading a BoA note, where they quoted the Visual Capitalist.  The following is just a mind blowing stat:

* To gain 100m users, the WWW took 8 years
* To gain 100m users, Facebook took 5 years
* To gain 100m users, MySpace took 3 years
* To gain 100m users, TikTok took 9 Month
* To gain 100m users, ChatGPT took 2 months

If you have anybody that is a teacher, they will tell you that ChatGPT has moved so hard into the classroom that they don't know how to control it or what exactly to do with it.  And kids are already using it to help them with their homework.  To kids, the use of ChatGPT is obvious.

However, to the older ""kids"" in the marketplace, they don't understand what is going on.  For example, most of the commentor on CNBC are saying, ""AI needs to show an ROI.""  I'm convinced that we have a cliff problem spurred on by Microsoft Co-Pilot.  

Let me explain:  I think business runs on MS-Office.  The face of AI for many of these users is MS-CoPilot.  Right now, Copilot is simply not compelling.  It is ""okay"" but I believe that many people are not impressed.  My signal for this is there is not reddit sub that is bragging on how Co-Pilot changed people's lives.

[As a matter of fact, if you look at the data, ChatGPT has gone down in traffic dramatically](https://explodingtopics.com/blog/chatgpt-users).  By this you would think that it was a fad.

Now, we can query ChatGPT and ask ""why is your traffic down?""  It gives the standard answers of saturation, comp, and other factors.  We can actually go to [Meta.ai](http://Meta.ai) and it gives a more more compelling answer.  Student took a summer break.  [They then link the answer](https://cointelegraph.com/news/chat-gpt-web-traffic-drops-third-consecutive-month-august).

[Eric Schmidt recently gave a very compelling overview of the AI market](https://youtu.be/7PMUVqtXS0A?si=K209qitvuMYhD666).  

Eric Jackson at EMJ capital is very savvy, and saying ""Eric Schmidt...in talking to Sam Altman, each of the hyperscaler will need to spend...$300B each in the next three years.  ...there are some shocking applications coming out over the next few years, I've seen some that make the hair stand up on the back of my neck.""

What we need to do is translate the heavy use by kids in school with business.  What is happening is that we have a cliff problem.   Really, if you want to invest in AI, you need to do a little bit of research on how the current AI is based on tensors.  The key behind Tensors is training them.  Basically, a tensor serves as a neural net that you train and you don't program.  It turns out that training is a lot easier when you get to certain types of problems.  We are training AI to be your helper, just like on Blade Runner.

Right now tensors are smarter than your average 5th grader (and maybe high schooler) at doing the type of work schools ask them to do, rote ""show me how to write an essay.""  Right now, the models are great at helping out school kids.  The problem is that they aren't better than the average officer worker for doing the type of things they need to do but mainly because the providers have not offered the glue in logic between your workflow and your AI assistant.  

The issue is that training of these models are very achievable and we are well on our way to getting the models up to the competency of the average office worker.  To Jackson's point, these types of apps are hair raising.  At the same time, Co-Pilot doesn't look attractive, but Microsoft has a landing beach.  Most people won't remember that Microsoft Word wasn't a success until 3.0, but then it saw amazing growth.  In the same fashion, it took Word for Windows to challenge the Mac.

The most perplexing thing that has been stopping me is ""this is just another Cisco and the internet bubble.""  However, the more I think about it, the less convinced that I am about the similarities.  

The internet bubble was about a thousand web start-ups that got amazing funding.  The draw of the internet is that it removed friction, and was truly revolutionary.  The problem with the internet is that it was only one piece of the puzzle.  You needed a web store, a backend, logistics chain, accounting systems, and a host of other things to make your internet go.  Amazon is the clear leader in this transition, but they had to build warehouse and offer next day delivery to make it go.  The internet drove tremendous capital costs.

AI is completely different.  The ""only"" capital cost is putting in the chips and putting the software stack on top of it.  Once you have this up and running, all you need to do is replace people.   AI is a program and thus sidesteps a tremendous amount of the capital costs.

To implement AI, you need access to an AI factory to create your models.  Then you can drop these models into your workflow, and remove people.  We are just starting to get all the pieces in place for this to happen.

I am going to overstate thing, but the one issue with AI is the capital cost of the processors to allow you to do all the software work.  Right now, nVidia is enjoying a robust Cuda layer that everybody is writing their libraries to.  On top of this, nVidia has totally outsourced their production to TSMC.  Thus they don't even think about fab capital costs (which is a bit of an overstatement but pretty close).

[TSMC is just a massive issue in terms of a vulnerability, but for Taiwan it is seen as the Silicon Shield against China](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2024-08-01/tsmc-sparks-patriotic-spirit-of-taiwan-investors-video#:~:text=So%20on%20the%20ground%20in,the%20nation%20or%20the%20Silicon).  The entire nation of Taiwan, including the government and all the people, believe that the USA will fly to save Taiwan from China because of TSMC.  Therefore, the entire nation of Taiwan has skin in the game to make sure that they don't falter.  I personally believe they are correct, but it doesn't matter because if you are Taiwanese, you are dedicated to making sure that TSMC does well.

The problem with Tensor based AI is that there is no good visionary for what is coming that knows how to tie together the technology, sell the product, and make it clear that they are the company to invest in.

With the iPhone, we had Jobs.  [All you needed was to watch his presentation of the iPhone](https://youtu.be/9hYjzF3OJyM?si=xvFogtp3f1tvZVqu). Jobs was brilliant in that he understood that the publicity needed to come as people could actually buy the product.  Today's leader have lost this ability to sell and have availability of product.

Google's CEO, Sundar Pichai, has tried to communicate the upcoming change.  The problem is he says things like ""more important than fire"" since 2018.  Then he went on to say it publicly.  The problem he is a visionary, and kept on trying to show example from Google where he creates a cooked case of Google's AI calling up and making restaurant reservations.  He is actually right, but he said it so early, and created demos so early that he jaded all investors about it.

Then basically Google dropped the ball.  Microsoft, who was clearly way behind Google, decide to outsource their AI to Sam Altman.  Then ChatGPT board basically went insane.  They actually fired Altman.  They basically recommitted the sin of getting rid of Steven Jobs at Apple.   Although I don't have time, this is actually very fortunate for Sam.  The first thing that Jobs did when he got back to Apple in '97 was redo the board.  With that said, Sam is not the voice of this movement.  He is no Steven Jobs for presentations although he is visionary in his execution.

I just don't know, but perhaps Zuckerberg has got something going on.  Eric Jackson rifted on the idea that actually the MetaVerse was just Zuck head faking everybody.  I don't think this is right, but I do think that he pivoted very hard.  However, Zuck plans to keep this as a internal advantage.

Amazon is just lost for communicating a vision.  It doesn't matter because Amazon is just a machine that is driven by competitive rivalry.  I continue to believe they are a great investment as it will be all about capital for the DC creation.

Of everybody, I actually thing that Jensen Huang is the best.  The problem is that he only lives at the hardware level.  I don't think it matters.  

nVidia is a strategic stock.  Buy and hold.  You will get alpha."
1ez41to,7,2024-08-23,Is there any way to segment a homelab from the rest of my home network if my router isn't vlan aware?,u/admadio,homelab,https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/1ez41to/is_there_any_way_to_segment_a_homelab_from_the/,"Hi all, I am a student learning about networking and have been looking to set up a homelab to run opnsense, host a private media server, run ollama, and maybe some personal NAS. The problem I have run into is that I, as many college students, live with roommates and they aren't comfortable with me replacing our non vlan-aware ISP router with my own so I could set up vlans to separate my lab from the lan. I have been looking into opnsense and I currently have my laptop and an old optiplex 390 that would be perfect for opnsense if I added a nic or two. I am wondering if there is a way for me to run an opnsense firewall on the optiplex, wire that to the router, set up vlans from there, and run other equipment. Or if not, if there is any other solution to my issue besides investing in a separate internet connection. Thanks!

Edit: Thank you to everyone for your helpful responses, I have learned alot. I now know that I have multiple options here, 1) wire my optiplex 390 to the ISP router and install OPNsense and a PCIe NIC with a couple ethernet ports, enable port forwarding on the router as well as a static IP/DHCP reservation for OPNsense, and build out my lab from there. 2) Invest in a machine with more power, run Proxmox or a similar Level 1 hypervisor and with a mix of external/internal virtual switches, set up a virtual LAN configuration and host my lab virtually. Again, I appreciate all of you guys' helpful responses and I am super excited about everything I've learned here and the work I have ahead of me as until last night when I learned more about OPNsense and double-NAT configurations, I thought due to my roomates not wanting me to replace the ISP router with one I would buy that I wasn't going to be able to build the homelab I have been dreaming of."

In my previous school, I was close with all my classmates and the school is only 5 minutes away by foot, so I had almost no stress and found free time for my hobbies, sports and future plans. 
What threw me off were the teachers, I’m the only non German kid left in class (all foreigners left by the middle of the year because they couldn’t take the racism no more) and unfortunately we have a few teachers that are highly conservative and racist, who grade me very badly even though I get better results than my other classmates and never ever pick me in class or let me speak, and sometimes make me wait outside of the class until the lesson ends. There have been days where I came home sobbing because of the mobbing from the teachers. My grades at that school were therefore average, which is very bad for me since I was an excellent student before coming to that school.

So I changed my school to another city which is 1.5 hours away, I have to travel with bus and train and have to get up at 5.30 everyday. It’s very stressful and I never have time for sports nor hobbies. The social environment is also the opposite of my old school. No one speaks with each other and no one seems to be friends, and the few people I tried to speak with avoided me. I’m a very social person too.

However, the teachers at this school are excellent, and I feel like I could get better grades here (If I worked hard of course.) 

About my goals, I have less desire to study and more desire to start my own business and be an entrepreneur. I already have a business plan, did my research about the demand and supply and the current market, how to finance and I was hoping to get all my documents and permissions done by the end of the highschool so I can start my business right after I graduate. My parents however have a different plan for me. They want me so study and get to an excellent university and work at a safe job “without risk”, maybe I could do that for a few years but I’d hate my life if I had to do that my whole career. I also can’t plan ahead for my business like I wanted to if I be this stressed  all year round. Although I don’t want to disappoint my parents either. 

So what do I do? I don’t know if it’s worth all this stress and no free time for the grades I don’t even need for my ultimate goal. I can get into a university either way but don’t know if it’s worth to get into an excellent one my parents want and sacrifice my time for it. My parents of course advise me to stay in the far away school but chatgpt advises me to go back to my old school.

Unlike traditional textbooks like Guyton or Robbins, this book will be more like BnB or Pathoma but with clearer explanations. Sometimes, books like Pathoma and BnB skips conceptual details, leading to lack of understanding. To clarify what kind of book I'm projecting to you people, I'll provide some examples from CNS module, which I’m currently studying. For example, some pathology textbooks just mention that neurodegenerative diseases result in hydrocephalus ex vacuo, but they don’t explain ""how"" or ""why"" this happens. Even Pathoma lectures don't clearly address this point. However, ChatGPT provided an explanation to me that I found more helpful than what I've learned from any of my college professors or Pathoma/BnB

'When neurons degenerate, they shrink in size. As the brain tissue shrinks, a vacuum forms outside the brain, creating negative pressure. We know that negative pressure has a suction effect, which stretches the brain parenchyma. The ventricles, which normally can't expand due to limited space, now have room to expand because of the vacuum and negative forces. To maintain constant CSF pressure in the ventricles, more CSF is produced in these expanded ventricles.'""

Another Example: Traditional Books --> paediatric CNS tumors develop infratentorially, but it fails to explain into the 'why' and 'how.' ChatGPT provided me this explanation --> This occurs because the structures below the tentorium include the brainstem and cerebellum. Nature operates selectively: it prioritizes the development of the brainstem and cerebellum first. Why? Because these regions house critical centers for survival, such as the breathing and cardiac centers. supratentorial structures deal with memory, thought processes, behavior, sex, and emotions functions necessary later in life. Hence, their development isn't essential during childhood. A newborn child can survive without memory, sex, behaviour, thoughts but it can't survive without breathing and circulation so, there's rapid cell multiplication of infratentorial structures in neonates. During this process, cells may make mistakes and acquire mutations due to their rapid growth.This level of conceptual understanding is missing even in resources like Robbins. My goal is to build a resource, with the help of volunteers, that provides detailed explanations for every point covered in Pathoma, BnB, and even First Aid or UWorld. Pathoma covers pathology in 19 chapters, so if 20 people each take one chapter, we could finish the book in 4-5 months. This way, it’s manageable for everyone involved. The goal is to make a book that not only states facts but also explains the ""how"" and ""why"" behind them. I want a team of volunteers who are interested in creating a resource like this. There’s no limit to how many people can join.

Only providing 4 traits is kinda lame but it went all out otherwise. I really like the idea of a mentor and apprentice trait, but I'm not sure how that would work. Maybe something like Fated where you tie each mentor to a specific Apprentice?  That sounds super neat tbh. Otherwise, ""Arcane Mastery"" sounds incredibly generic, and ""Elemental Confluence"" just sounds like Ixtal or Set 2's Avatar Lux with extra steps. Then again, I'm not sure what I expected out of ChatGPT except one or two things being super generic at best. Most of the champions don't seem very unique, but given the massive volume of TFT spells used it's kind of hard to be. Yasuo's knockup when a unit is low is unique for sure but that sounds insanely frustrating to deal with, especially for a 1 cost.

Anyway, play around with the theme or prompt as a whole and see what you can get! This is a super neat idea and I can't believe I hadn't thought of it before Mort suggested trying it"
1ezl15f,36,2024-08-23,TOEFL preparation strategy ,u/paglaulta,ToeflAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/ToeflAdvice/comments/1ezl15f/toefl_preparation_strategy/,"
Hello everyone, I would like to share my preparation strategy with you all. I would like to begin by saying that I am not a native English speaker, and I am also a slow learner, so it took me a month to prepare for the TOEFL. However, the preparation time may vary from person to person depending on their proficiency in English.
I only used the following resources for the TOEFL preparation:
1. Official Guide to the TOEFL iBT Test (7th edition)
2. TST prep videos
3. Elsa speech analyzer

In my opinion, the official guide was the most beneficial resource because it provided insights into how test graders evaluate responses and included sample tests in each section, along with explanations for correct and incorrect answers. Additionally, it offered four full practice tests at the end, which was more cost-effective compared to purchasing them directly from the ETS website. If you are interested, feel free to send me a direct message, and I can provide you with the contact information of an individual from whom I obtained the guide at a significantly reduced price.

Here are my strategies for each of the sections.

## Reading 📖
In the reading section, effective time management is essential. A strategy that proved successful for me was prioritizing the question before examining the choices. I would begin by reading the passage title to gain an understanding of the content. My primary advice for this section is to read with the intention of comprehension. When we engage with interesting material, we not only enhance our focus but also retain intricate details. This approach prevents repetitive reading of the same lines. Additionally, familiarizing ourselves with the question and options beforehand aids in comprehension. I would like to share my approach to each question type.

1. Factual Info
This is the most prevalent type. For this question, I kindly suggest not overthinking the answer, as it is either explicitly stated in the paragraph or simply rephrased.

2. Negative Factual Info
For this question, you can use the process of elimination. Simply identify and eliminate the options that are already mentioned in the paragraph. This will eventually leave you with the correct answer, which may not be explicitly stated in the paragraph or may contradict what is already stated.

3. Vocabulary Questions
For this, I kindly suggest reviewing Magoosh's TOEFL English Vocabulary Cards. Additionally, pay close attention to the context in which the words are used, as the question does not ask for the direct meaning, but rather for the word that is closest to the given word. If you are unfamiliar with a word, eliminate options that you know are incorrect and substitute the word in the sentence to see if it makes sense.

4. Reference Questions
These are quite simple and uncommon. To answer this, simply read the sentence in which the word occurs. If not, read the sentence before that, and the answer is usually in these sentences. Reference questions typically ask you about a specific phenomenon that occurs or directly refer to a place. Here, again, substitute the highlighted word or words and see if it makes grammatical sense.

5. Sentence Simplification Questions
To find the answer, begin by eliminating options that are illogical or omit crucial details. Then, try rephrasing the question in your own words. Keep in mind that the correct response should be a paraphrase that emphasizes key information without contradicting the original text.

6. Inference Questions
This question is indeed challenging for me to address. To approach this question effectively, it would be beneficial to examine the initial sentences of the passage. The author typically begins by presenting a point, followed by an example that serves to reinforce the aforementioned point.

7. Rhetorical Purpose Questions 
In this question, we are asked to understand why the author mentions something, rather than focusing on factual information. To approach this question effectively, let's begin by reading the two sentences preceding the highlighted question. Our goal is to comprehend the logical flow between these sentences and gain a deeper understanding of the author's intent.

8. Insert Text Questions 
It is quite simple to comprehend once you grasp the logical progression. To address this, simply replace the text and read the sentences that come before and after it. Do they make logical sense? If not, then that is not the solution.

9. Prose Summary Questions 
This is indeed the most challenging question, but it becomes quite manageable once you grasp the technique to answer it. My approach was to jot down the main idea of each passage in a word or two while reading the passages. This allowed me to swiftly locate the relevant information within the paragraph. One common mistake I made was attempting to read the entire paragraphs from the beginning. As mentioned earlier, if you read with the intention of understanding, you will not need to revisit the text repeatedly. It is crucial to recognize that the question seeks the main ideas of the passage. Although certain points may be mentioned in the passage, they serve merely as supporting arguments and examples and do not contribute to expressing the overall idea. The most effective approach to answering this question is to select the options that you believe are correct and then verify them against the passage. Ask yourself whether they convey the main idea or are simply supporting evidence. If the option is not mentioned at all or contradicts a sentence, you can eliminate it.

This concludes the reading strategy. Please remember to read with the intention of understanding, as if you are reading your favorite manga or a series that you enjoy. Additionally, jot down the main points of each passage, as this will assist you in answering the final question. Avoid overthinking, as you can always return for a review later.

## Listening 🦻
Here are some tips that might be helpful:
- Listen with the intent to understand the conversation, not to answer questions.
- Take notes, but don't try to write down everything. Use abbreviations instead of writing whole words.
- Pay attention to the main idea of the conversation or lecture.
- Don't worry about the different types of questions. Just listen and note important points and examples.
- I used short forms such as S and T to represent the student and teacher

## Speaking
Here comes the most challenging aspect. I am not accustomed to speaking English regularly, as I am an introvert. Nevertheless, the most valuable advice I can offer is to comprehend how the system and the human raters will evaluate you. The three criteria are: Language, Delivery, and Topic Development. Language refers to how you employ grammar to convey ideas. It is crucial that your sentences are grammatically sound, and you are capable of forming complex sentences. One suggestion is to combine sentences using 'because' or any conjunction rather than constructing short sentences. For instance, instead of stating, ""I did not go to the library. I had to finish my project at home,"" you could say, ""I did not go to the library because I had to finish my project at home.""
The system considers this as a complex sentence and also enhances your Delivery. Regarding Delivery, the most crucial aspect is your sustained speech. It evaluates your ability to maintain your speaking for an extended period. Can you speak without using filler words and maintain a consistent pace throughout the speaking time? Concentrate on your pronunciation, intonation, and strive to sound natural. It is essential to appear genuine. Avoid faking an accent or attempting to speak too loudly, as this will not only slow you down but also hinder your ability to perform well. Although I have an Indian accent, my speech is clear, and the examiner can comprehend what I am saying without difficulty. As for topic development, ensure that you adhere to the structure that I will share with you now.

### Independent speaking 
For this practice on a wide range of topics, I kindly request ChatGPT to provide me with a list of questions and engage in a conversation. It is crucial to maintain a continuous flow of speech and time oneself to enhance fluency. Initially, the mind may go blank, but consistent practice will help overcome this challenge.

I suggest starting with creating stories related to personal experiences, such as hobbies, acquired skills, or favorite places. These can then be applied to different scenarios. It is important to remember that there are no right or wrong answers, and even if an example is not entirely accurate, the examiners are generally understanding.

For those who lack friends to practice speaking with, ChatGPT can be a valuable tool. By engaging in voice conversations and requesting questions and feedback, one can improve their speaking skills effectively.

My template:
In my personal opinion[my opinion]. I believe so because[why I believe so]. First, [give a reason]. For instance [give example]. Second, [give a reason]. For example/As an illustration [give example]. In conclusion [if you have time to conclude]

It is perfectly acceptable to provide either a single reason and example or two reasons followed by two examples, whichever you find most appropriate. Personally, I opted for just one reason and an example. A conclusion is not necessary.

### Integrated task 2
Here you will be given a notice about a change on campus or a proposal. Jot down the modifications being implemented along with the justifications provided. Subsequently, simply record the reasons for the other person's agreement or disagreement, along with the two points they raise.

My template:
The reading is about a change on campus. It discusses the university's decision [decision]. The reason behind this is stated that.... (if change suggested by administration)
The letter proposes a change on campus. It suggests [suggestion]. The rationale behind this is that...... (if suggested by a person)
The man in the conversation disagrees/supports this change. He raises his concern by stating that/He appreciates the university's initiative by stating that...
First, he starts off by saying that....
Additionally, he points out that....
Moreover, he mentions that....
In conclusion, the man voices his concern/shows his encouragement (if you have time for conclusion)


### Integrated task 3
In this you will read a definition about a topic, and then listen to a lecture about the same topic with an example. Jot down the topic name and its definition and what causes it in the reading. And then the example given by the lecturer.

My template:
According to the reading [topic] is [topic definition]. The professor further elaborates on this topic by taking an example. He starts of by saying that [what he says]. Furthermore he states that [what does he state]

### Integrated task 4
In this section, you will only be listening to a lecture and then speaking. The lecturer will always provide two examples about a topic after a brief discussion. You may choose to explain the topic followed by the definitions, or simply provide the two definitions with examples. I opted to provide the two definitions with examples.

My template: 
The professor discusses about the two different kinds/types/classification [of whatever]
First he mentions that... He illustrates this with the help of an example [example]
In contrast (since the other definition will always contrast), [define the topic]. For instance [example]

It is crucial to be confident, speak naturally, and use proper pronunciation. Occasional stumbles are acceptable, but it is advisable to avoid using filler words like ""umm"" and ""uhh"" as the system can detect them. Despite experiencing some difficulties and being unable to complete Task 3, I still managed to achieve a perfect score. Even ETS acknowledges that minor errors can get you a perfect score.

## WRITING
For this section, it is crucial to minimize typos and avoid excessive repetition of words. Paraphrasing is highly encouraged, as directly copying from the reading passage will negatively impact your scores. Additionally, working on your typing speed would be beneficial. A good target would be 60 words per minute. Make sure to allocate at least three minutes to review your answers for the first task and two minutes for the second task. While the word count is not a primary concern, ensure that you meet the minimum word limit. I went overboard and wrote a 300+  and 180+ in the two sections. 

My template for writing task 1:
Here I wrote an intro followed by 3 paragraphs. In each argument, I provide a summary of the author's position and the lecturer's counterarguments.

Intro
The reading and the lecture discuss about [whats the topic]
While the author presents three explanations about [about the topic], the lecturer however challenges each of these claims.

Body1
First, the author argues that [his point]. In contrast, the lecturer contends this by stating that [what he states]

Body2
Second, the author suggests that [his point]. The lecturer opposes this. He starts off by saying that [his argument]

Body3
Finally, the author claims [his point]. On the other hand, the lecturer refutes this claim. According to him [his point]

To add info use : Additionally, Furthermore, Moreover 
To give an example use: For example, For instance, As an illustration, Such as
To oppose: Refute, Challenge, Contend, Conversely 
To show effect use: Hence, Therefore, As a result 
To summarize use: In conclusion, To sum up, In summary

My template for writing task 2:
Here, I would lpresent my perspective and the reasoning behind it. Subsequently, I would express my agreement with one of the statements while adding my own viewpoint. Conversely, I would disagree with the other statement and provide my reasons for doing so.

In my personal opinion [my opinion]. I believe that [reason]. I agree with Peter's argument that [his argument paraphrased]. I would like to add that [my point]. Although  Claire raises a valid argument [her argument], however it's important to note thay [my reason challenging her]

Pro tip:
If you, like me, have difficulty speaking in noisy environments, I have a suggestion that may be helpful. I discovered that in the examination center, it is not necessary to begin reading immediately. When I arrived and sat down with everyone else, I simply remained seated in the reading section for approximately 20 minutes. By the time I reached my speaking section, most of the other examinees had either completed their exams or had moved on to the writing section. This allowed me to speak without being distracted by the noise.

And speaking of distractions, my testing experience was the worst as there was ongoing construction with constant drilling noises and no noise-canceling headphones were provided. So if possible, try to opt for the home edition or ensure you book a test center with adequate equipment. I wish ETS would check the quality of the centers, as it is quite expensive. A friend of mine had to retake the exam due to similar issues. Alternatively, consider taking the IELTS exam, as their testing experience is better, and you actually converse with a human during the speaking section.

I hope this is helpful. I wish everyone who is preparing the best of luck. May you all achieve your desired scores. 🎉 ^^"
1ezlux7,7,2024-08-23,I Think I have This Prompt Engineering Thing Figured Out,u/HeWhoRemaynes,ClaudeAI,https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1ezlux7/i_think_i_have_this_prompt_engineering_thing/,"Before I start I want to beg everyone to use the API if you're really serious about using Claude. I gave been coding my frigging ass off and I just spent my first 20 bucks in a 39 day period. And I am developing AI applications for niche use cases. 

The API's one best advantage (besides that it gets way more smutty when no one is watcning)is that it is co distant. The best metaphor I can think of is that it's like being a non custodial parent. Every time you see your kid it runs the chance of being different in a way you don't like. The API lets you freeze that kid in amber so it's like he always wants to talk aboht baseball and dinosaurs and not Yung Boaty or whatever musician is hot right mow. 

That said, on to the code prompting. I'll show an example then explain what I'm up to. 

You are a orofessor teaching Discotheque management at the University of Funk. You are grading final projects according to a rubric that will be supplied along with wach particular assignment as the user_prompt. 

***prompt here***

Wvaluate, without quoting, the applicant's understanding of disco ball supply chain management. Always begin with [Mr./Mrs.Ms.][Student] Address heading 4 (appraisal of functions of spherical mirror design) and subquestions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. Address heading 5 (understanding seasonal fluctuations in glitter supply) and subquestion 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 without quoting the student. a typical positive response to question 5 would flow like the following example (eg. He knew that the glitter mines of Vietnam are prone to severe flooding so his suggestion  to source glittef from a slightly more expensive , but ecologically stable, region displayed  foresight.). Do not quote the student in your response]

During your evaluation remember to:

1. Analyze the quality of the response without focusing on grammar
2. Never quote the student directly 
3. Use appropriate styling in your response to ensure readability.
4. Output the file in HTML suitable to be displayed on a webpage

*** End of Prompt ***

I have found that nesting instructions inside parenthesis or brackets causes claude to follow the instructions for that section and then go back to what it was doing nist like a math problem. This allows me to give ckaude instructions within a document without it losing the plot on longer tasks with differing requirements. 

To close if you don't know how to use the Aaoai and want someone to show you just DM me. I will show you for free. I might ask you to endorse me on LinkedIn as knowing what I'm doing but thats really it. Also of you have a billion dollar idea and want to shower me with money I won't turn it down. But I'll really so it for free.

1f01111,2,2024-08-24,"Feeling like i have not learnt anything even after 2 years in college, feeling very demotivated and lost, advice and help needed.",u/RedLightnng,Btechtards,https://www.reddit.com/r/Btechtards/comments/1f01111/feeling_like_i_have_not_learnt_anything_even/,"As the title says, I just finished my second year of CSE and i feel like i am no better than i was in 1st year. Sure i know more computer lingo and coding now but it is nowhere near enough to land me a job and I am very afraid. I joined CSE because i love computers and coding but after 2 years all I have to show for it is basic coding.

I started learning Flutter because app development was really intriguing and now I have shifted to learning machine learning first. I have a lot of doubts regarding these topics, so much so that i finally decided to make a post in desperation to ask actual people for advice.

First off, machine learning. I have created a couple very small projects for college which use  ""machine learning"" but in reality are just simple face recognition attendance systems or natural language to MySQL code converters that rely on already built infrastructure like opencv and face\_recognition for the attendance system and a chatgpt api for the natural language to SQL one. This mostly invalidates it as ML cause all i did was simple stuff and since i did not know the syntax i used chatgpt for it. almost 70%-80% of the code was written by chatgpt with my contribution being mainly the idea and debugging. I understand that no one is born with the knowledge of the syntax but i feel like this mostly invalidates my project as chatgpt played a huge role in it. This is the reason why i am so lost in machine learning i dont understand what to learn when most of the ai tool/datasets you might need are already available. Currently doing a coursera course on ML to understand it.

Next up is app development. Flutter is a relatively new language but it seemed like fun so i started learning it, i know the very basics and i can probably create a basic calculator app in it. I did make a linear search and binary search visualizer in flutter and it was okay-ish so i dont have as many issues with it, I will learn it slowly.

Now on to my biggest issue. coding in general, i can manage hackerrank but leetcode really pushes me, i can handle leetcode easy questions but leetcode medium questions make me look up methods to do them. In this case too I understand that i am supposed to learn so even if i google how to solve a specific question and then am made aware of a method called sliding window and then remember it so i can use it in the future that is good enough but i somehow feel like a cheat and no good enough whenever i look up leetcode questions. Now our college wants us to do 10 leetcode hard questions which is really messing up my head because it really warps my perception to think of how capable my college thinks we are to attempt leetcode hard questions and makes me wonder whether I am the inadequate one for not being able to solve them.

On top of this i have a laughable Resume. I have nothing to add, no hackathon wins, no certificates except maybe hackerrank python certificate. I did get 6 month virtual internship on samsung from a samsung program called samsung PRISM but that is it. I have nothing else to add. I want to collect more achievements to put on my resume so if i apply for internships in 3rd year in a couple months and they ask for my resume i dont hang my head in shame.  
This might be generic student ranting you people periodically see but it would honestly be life changing if i can be offered some guidance here."

I am learning Palestinian Arabic from Palweb. I only have good things to say so far and I compliment this with Chat GPT. I was using this website for pronunciation [https://acapela-box.com/AcaBox/index.php](https://acapela-box.com/AcaBox/index.php) but they've closed the website, so I am using a different one. I fortunately have a student from Palestine who can correct pronunciation from time to time, but I need something a little more concrete.

With regards to ChatGPT, you can simply ask  questions and they will give you the correct answer in Arabic. If you're unsure of the characters that are in the words, you can ask them to spell that individual word which I find really helps.

  
Does anyone have any instagram people to follow from Palestine that speak in Arabic. I follow a lot of people who are from Palestine but for obvious reasons, they speak in English. 

  
I would love to hear back from people who are learning this dialect!

1f08a0b,26,2024-08-24,Is it really that bad?,u/Beautiful-Boss3739,unimelb,https://www.reddit.com/r/unimelb/comments/1f08a0b/is_it_really_that_bad/,"Hello all,

I am an American who plans on moving to Melbourne in the next couple of years. I’d like to continue my education at UniMelb (Bachelors) because of their supposedly elite Arts program, especially in Anthropology. I’ll have a family Visa so I’ll be enrolling as a local student/permanent resident already by the time I’m there.

So naturally, I’ve been lurking here to get a sense of the culture and I can’t say that I’m optimistic. The most common complaint I keep seeing here is that like half of the students can’t even speak English… This especially makes it difficult for other students because there are lots of group-projects that assumedly get the same grade for every student. On top of that, I am Asian (though I speak fluent English since I grew up in America), and I keep hearing that Aussie students will assume that you can’t speak English or that you won’t understand them if you look Asian and won’t talk to you, even for class projects etc.

I wish to eventually either go into Research or go to Law School, and I need a high WAM for both paths. Is it even possible to have a high WAM if there are constant group projects with totally incompetent students? I’m also very uncomfortable with the apparently commonplace use of ChatGPT and cheating in general at a supposedly elite institution. In the US, getting caught cheating can often lead to suspension in Universities like Yale, Harvard, or even BU or Colombia etc.

In any case, I want to double major in Anthropology and Philosophy doing a BA (obv). A part of me wants to believe that these problems are more common in BS courses since they are less “language-focused”? But when looking at the UniMelb website, the language requirements do seem ridiculously low for both. 

Does anyone have any insights on exactly how difficult it might be to get a good education and get good marks in my courses? Is it even worth it? Like am I actually gonna learn anything?

I was hoping that maybe I’ll do an Honors Degree, then a PhD in Anthro and just try to become an independent researcher (if our personal funds allow) since Academia also seems like a nightmare in Australia according to the people here lol. Is getting a UniMelb education a good path towards this goal? 

Any feedback is appreciated, from anyone who had experience in the goals and expectations I have listed above. (BA, Honors, PhD, Academia, Independent research) What are your recommendations?

Thank you all!"

I've never hated Windows there are something I disagree with Windows but always say nothing is prefect in the OS world. Linux was the OS I prefer more. I used a mixture of Microsoft ecosystem and Google's ecosystems. Microsoft: OneDrive, ToDos, Online Office, Edge, and OneNote. Google: Calendar, Gmail, and Photos. I was using both free version of Microsoft and Google's cloud services.

Last week I went to a concert, and I own S24 Ultra so I'm recording and taking pictures not the highest quality, it can do but at least UHD (because if you record or take pictures in really high quality you lose the 30x to 100x zoom and where we were sitting it was needed). Of course, it took A LOT of storage and took up my free Google storage. I didn't know it did until I notice my forwarded Gmail that goes to my Outlook instead seeing it on my Gmail. When I looked at Gmail website, I saw my Google storage was full and saw it was the videos I've taken from the concert.

So, I was deciding either get Google One or Microsoft 365. I thought about Google but for me seeing that only use I'll use for it is extra Google storage. I was comparing yearly subscription Google One 100GB is $20/y and 2TB is for $100/y with not much extra features that's useful for me other than the extra Drive storage. Microsoft 365 Personal was $70/y 1TB OneDrive and Office included. Doing some research even got desperate and ask AI (Copilot, Gemini, and ChatGPT). I'm a college student that's going into IS and also got a PRN Service Desk, so Microsoft ecosystem became my choice. Even though in at my college using my college email I do get Office 365 for free but don't want to put my personal information in my college OneDrive. Until I saw and Copilot and ChatGPT mentions there is Microsoft 365 Personal for students for $3/m, for me that's a great deal. So, I started my subscription.

I figure for me to get my money worth I installed Windows 11 and started to use it. Long ago I used to hate on Windows because I was a Linux user until I got my first IT job as a student worker and started to respect Windows and what it does. I learn I enjoy OSes and have no strong opinion with either of them anymore. When Windows 11 came out I didn't care much about it until I think this latest update made it more stable. I still don't care about the start menu, so I install Start11 made it have a round taskbar and Start11 modern menu."

`Define the course parameters: SUBJECT=[subject name], AUDIENCE=[target audience], DURATION=[course length in weeks]~Create a course outline with main modules, each focusing on a key aspect of the subject~For each module, list 3-5 specific learning objectives that align with the overall course goals~Develop a detailed syllabus including module titles, topics covered, estimated time for completion, and required materials~Create an introduction module that explains the course structure, expectations, and provides an overview of the subject~For Module 1, design a lesson plan with lecture content, practical exercises, and multimedia resources~Develop assessment methods for Module 1, including quizzes, assignments, or projects that test the module's learning objectives~Repeat the lesson plan and assessment development process for the next half of the modules~Create interactive elements for each module, such as discussion prompts, group activities, or hands-on projects~Design a mid-course project or assignment that integrates concepts from the first half of the course~Develop lesson plans and assessments for the remaining modules, incorporating more advanced concepts and building on earlier modules~Create a final project or exam that comprehensively assesses the entire course content~Develop a resource list including textbooks, online materials, and supplementary reading for each module~Create a glossary of key terms and concepts covered throughout the course~Design a feedback mechanism for students to evaluate the course and suggest improvements~Develop a guide for instructors, including teaching tips, common student challenges, and suggested solutions~Create a course completion certificate template and criteria for earning the certificate`

Make sure you update the variables in the first prompt, SUBJECT, AUDIENCE, and DURATION and then you can pass this prompt chain into [ChatGPT Queue](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/chatgpt-queue-save-time-w/iabnajjakkfbclflgaghociafnjclbem?hl=en&authuser=0) extension and it will just run autonomously.

1f0euv1,1,2024-08-24,Is it legal for a teacher for not letting the class leave to our safe zone during a power outage and very bad weather?,u/Particular_Tale_5957,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1f0euv1/is_it_legal_for_a_teacher_for_not_letting_the/,"I was a sophomore in high school in 8th hour Study Hall the last class of the day. The teacher supervising who we are going to call Dr. Didn't, this is because we were sure she DIDN'T pass college to get that Dr. title. Don't let the Dr. fool you, she knew nothing. Everything body always said that she doesn't help you learn anything, and enables you to use ChatGPT for anything. Not joking apparently, she did a whole project on creating questions and letting ChatGPT answer them. A rumor did spread about apparently a bunch of actual shit was found in our school hallway. We assumed it was our principal's dog, but during one class in the morning she told her class that she ""Did an Accident"". You would think our school would have fired her by now. One day, the weather was terrible, thunder, hard rain, and even a little hail, even some counties reported tornados touching down. On this day, during Study Hall, the power goes out and the emergency lights flash with a loud siren that made everyone's' ears ring. In this case, we would all go to our safe area, which is a hallway we call the mining tunnel because it looks like and smells like one. As most of the class was getting up to walk out the door, Dr. Didn't stop us. Everyone was confused. Dr. Didn't tell us, ""We could not leave until someone comes down to tell her to leave, so sit down and do not leave"". This can't be something a teacher can do, what if a road sign comes through the window and chops us? We could hear and see other students and teachers walk over to the safe spot, but for more than two minutes, we sat there confused as to why we couldn't leave. It was not until a teacher did enter our room and told us to go. If that teacher hadn't noticed us, we would have stayed there for the whole time.

-----

This is not my story, I was there, but in a different class. Fun playing indoor volleyball when it got dark. 

We were wondering if this is even legal for a teacher to do. We want to get rid of her because she is teaching classes that we need for college, and not learning anything can be the downfall of our future. We have complained to the principal about her many times, but nothing has happened. I feel that maybe telling the principal that this is somehow illegal or very unsafe can fire her. This all happened in some place in Wisconsin.

So, is this legal?"

A wildly popular class of drugs called GLP-1 agonists—which includes Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro, and Zepbound—are revolutionizing the treatment of obesity. One in eight adults has tried a GLP-1 drug for weight loss or to manage their diabetes, and a tidal wave of research is revealing that these medications may also help with a range of health issues, from lowering the risk of heart disease and certain cancers to treating sleep apnea and substance use disorders. “These drugs are making a big difference because of how effective they are,”

Injectable weight-loss medications called semaglutides are helping people with obesity by reducing appetite. But could these drugs also be the next breakthrough in keeping your heart healthy? The Food and Drug Administration recently approved Wegovy, a brand name of semaglutide, as a secondary prevention medication to reduce risk of serious heart problems. Could your cardiologist soon be prescribing the weight-loss drug Wegovy to improve your heart health? “It wasn’t the weight loss necessarily that drove that benefit. It was something that seemed very specific to this semaglutide itself,” says Dr.

If you Google the terms “constipation” and “heart attack” it’s not long before the name Elvis Presley crops up. Elvis had a longstanding history of chronic constipation and it’s believed he was straining very hard to poo, which then led to a fatal heart attack. We don’t know what really happened to the so-called King of Rock-n-Roll back in 1977. There were likely several contributing factors to his death, and this theory is one of many.

But emotional, psychological and social factors can influence how we perceive and react to pain. “Pain is usually made up of a physical and a psychosocial component,” explains Noemi Gozzi, a doctoral student at ETH Zurich.

# [HIGHER THIAZIDE DOSES SHOWN TO REDUCE KIDNEY STONE EVENTS](https://healthmedicinet.com/higher-thiazide-doses-shown-to-reduce-kidney-stone-events/)

Higher thiazide doses are associated with greater reductions in urine calcium, which in turn correlate with fewer symptomatic kidney stone events, according to a Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) study published in JAMA Network Open. Thiazide diuretics, commonly prescribed to prevent kidney stone recurrence, are drugs that act directly on the kidneys to promote diuresis (urine flow) by inhibiting the sodium/chloride cotransporter located in the distal convoluted tubule of a nephron (the functional unit of a kidney). Thiazides are also used as a common treatment for high blood pressure and

Thyroid hormone plays a key role in regulating a range of physiologic functions, including metabolism, temperature, heart rate, and growth. It accomplishes this impressive array of activities by interacting with almost every organ system in the body. Yet despite a long history of research on how thyroid hormone influences different organs, its effects on arguably the most crucial organ—the brain—have remained shrouded in mystery. Now, scientists at Harvard Medical School have gained new insights into thyroid hormone’s effects on the brain. The work, conducted in mice and published Aug. 22

Epigenetic clocks are impacted by the differentiation stage and proliferation history of cells, as well as by age-associated changes in cell type composition.   How old are you, really? Your chronological age is the number of years you have been alive. Your biological age is how old your cells are, which scientists believe may better assess one’s age-related health and disease risk. People biologically age at different rates, depending on genetic and environmental factors, so that a person’s chronological age does not necessarily match their biological age. In

EQUAL ACCESS AND RESPECT ACT (wip)

### Updated Policy Proposal: **Inclusive Facilities and Education Initiative**

#### **Objective:**
To create a more inclusive environment in public and private spaces by making gender-neutral bathrooms mandatory in all buildings with restrooms and introducing optional LGBTQIA+ and transgender issues curriculum in schools. The plan aims to promote inclusivity while stimulating economic growth through job creation and government-backed financial support.

---

#### **I. Gender-Neutral Bathroom Mandate**

**1. Mandatory Implementation:**
   - All public and private buildings with restroom facilities must include a gender-neutral bathroom option. 
   - The gender-neutral bathroom must meet accessibility standards (ADA-compliant) and should be clearly marked.

**2. Government Incentives and Support:**
   - **Funding Grants:** The federal government will provide grants covering 75% of the costs for adding or converting existing restrooms into gender-neutral facilities. These grants will be accessible to all businesses, non-profits, and public institutions.
   - **Tax Credits:** Businesses that install gender-neutral bathrooms can claim a tax credit of up to $5,000 per restroom.
   - **Low-Interest Loans:** Small businesses may apply for low-interest loans to cover any additional costs not covered by grants or tax credits.
   - **Fast-Track Permits:** Local governments will offer expedited permitting processes for construction related to the implementation of gender-neutral bathrooms.
   - **Technical Assistance:** The government will establish a hotline and online resource center to provide free technical guidance and best practices for designing and installing gender-neutral bathrooms.

**3. Economic Stimulus:**
   - **Job Creation:** 
     - **Construction Jobs:** The initiative will create an estimated 100,000 new jobs in construction, plumbing, and related fields as businesses and institutions upgrade their facilities.
     - **Manufacturing Jobs:** The increased demand for bathroom fixtures and materials will stimulate growth in manufacturing, potentially creating 10,000 new jobs in this sector.
   - **Small Business Growth:** Businesses, especially those in the construction and design sectors, will benefit from increased demand, potentially leading to the creation of another 20,000 jobs.
   - **Local Economy Boost:** The influx of funds and economic activity will stimulate local economies, particularly in areas with high concentrations of businesses and institutions.

---

#### **II. Voluntary LGBTQIA+ and Transgender Issues Curriculum in Schools**

**1. Curriculum Development:**
   - **Voluntary Basis:** Schools will have the option to adopt an LGBTQIA+ and transgender issues curriculum, which will be available for grades K-12.
   - **Elective Courses:** The curriculum will not be required. Students will need to sign up for these classes as they would for any other elective. These courses can be taken in place of, or in addition to, traditional health education or social studies classes.
   - **Comprehensive Education:** The curriculum will cover topics such as gender identity, sexual orientation, historical contributions of LGBTQIA+ individuals, and the importance of inclusivity.
   - **Collaborative Input:** Curriculum development will involve educators, LGBTQIA+ advocacy groups, parents, and psychologists to ensure content is age-appropriate and inclusive.

**2. Government Support and Incentives:**
   - **Funding Grants:** Schools that choose to adopt the curriculum will be eligible for federal grants to cover the costs of new materials, teacher training, and additional staff.
   - **Teacher Training:** The government will fund specialized training programs for teachers to ensure they are equipped to deliver the new curriculum effectively.
   - **School Incentives:** Schools implementing the curriculum may receive additional funding based on the number of students enrolled in the courses.

**3. Economic Stimulus:**
   - **Educational Jobs:** The initiative is expected to create approximately 50,000 new teaching and administrative jobs across the country as schools hire specialized staff to deliver the curriculum.
   - **Training and Development Jobs:** The need for ongoing teacher training and curriculum development could create an additional 10,000 jobs in education and training services.
   - **Long-Term Economic Benefits:** Education on inclusivity and diversity will contribute to a more tolerant and productive workforce, reducing discrimination and increasing overall economic productivity.

---

1f0wbey,23,2024-08-25,Advice for undergrads and new grads who want to earn more than 30k monthly on their first job,u/Far-Exam-8909,PHJobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/PHJobs/comments/1f0wbey/advice_for_undergrads_and_new_grads_who_want_to/,"Hi! So I thought I'd write abt this since I think I'm fairly successful in my career and I am routinely asked what I did to get into the position that I'm in.

Brief history: I started working for an EA agency in 2021 where I started earning 45k/mo, benefits included. I was a 21 y/o then without any formal job experience or even a degree. I was, however, from UPD with freelancing and student org  leadership experiences, which I feel were decisive in getting the position. In 2023, I resigned from my job and got a position as an EA for a business owner who paid me $18.5/hr, effectively triple my past salary. Today, I charge $25-30/hr for my services and after only 3 years of working, I had quintupled my first salary.

General disclaimer:
- freelancing is extremely tough and unstable. It's not for everyone. 
- I acknowledge that I had privileges coming from a prestigious university and I don't deny that. However, I have referred many of my fellow iskas and iskos into the same field and they weren't able to break in. This is for people who are ambitious enough to try to replicate what I did.

So here it is!

General advice:

1. Rack up as much intership, student org, freelancing experiences as you can (if it's not too late). Anything that you can flex is a plus. 
2. Learn how to market yourself. Know what KPIs are and how you're contributing to them. You are not just a passive worker. You are actively contributing something to a company/business with your labor -- know what that is and market yourself appropriately.
3. Google Harvard resume and download the guide PDF. This changed the way I wrote resumes and cover letters forever. It has all the tips on writing a resume that you will ever need, from a sample format to the type of words you should even be using. 
- DO NOT put your personal details such as height, weight, religion, etc in your resume. You should not even be putting your full address other than just the city you're currently living in. And lastly, please refrain from putting your photo in your resume but if you are, make sure that it's atleast a professional headshot. I have reviewed thousands of resumes and you wouldn't believe the photos people are attaching on their professional documents.
- Canva templates you can see from a mile away. Your resume should be custom to your experiences. Ex. If you have a lot of skills, consider putting it at the top of your resume. If you're from a good school, put that at the top etc. The layout of your resume speaks volumes re: what you want to emphasize.
4. Practice your English. Don't stop studying until you can get a C2 in an EFSET exam.
- Practice speaking in English. This will be extremely important in interviews.
- Practice writing! Hirers value storytellers, people who can market themselves above all else. This will come in handy when you're writing a script for an intro video which a lot of freelancing agencies ask for.
5. Practice interviews! Always wear your best and be presentable on your interviews. This should go without saying but some people really miss the memo. Draft answers to the most common questions ahead of time so that you're not put in the spot. Guides on how to answer these questions you can be found everywhere. There are a lot of content creators that can teach you how to ace interviews and I encourage you to start watching them ASAP.
6. Be active on LinkedIn and optimize! After mastering how to market yourself and how to create an awesome resume, put your efforts into LinkedIn next. Update your experiences and connect with future employers and employees of the company you want to work for. Write posts and blogs of your experiences. Reach out to businesses who mighy be looking for the solution you're offering. 
7. Upskill whenever possible. There are so many online courses that are free on the Internet and generally you can all connect these to LinkedIn. However, please know that there are a lot of content creators who charge an arm and a leg for a shit course so beware. These people don't make money doing the skills they're boasting in their courses -- they make money from people who are buying their courses. Consider Udemy and Coursera, bonus if the course is offered by a prestigious institution like MIT etc. Upskilling can be the thing that splits the difference between you and the next eligible candidate.
- Post your results on LinkedIn! Whatever you learned or whatever you reflected on, post it there or on your social media of choice. I have seen many colleagues jump industries just from learning from an online course and be offered 30-40k for their first job just because there were people in LinkedIn impressed by their documentation.
8. Learn how to use AI. If you need to subscribe to ChatGPT 4o, consider it an investment for your future. You wouldn't believe the amount of leverage AI can give you. AI can analyze the key values of a company, the main keywords of a JD that you should be incorporating in your resume before you apply, and be a major assistant to when you're doing your job already. 
- Learn prompt engineering. There's a massive difference between people who know how to use AI and people who just type willy nilly into ChatGPT. If you use AI in your job application essays and you are not smart about it, believe me when I say that they will know and you will be immediately disqualified.
9. Know the values of the company before applying. Do they value long term employment? Going above and beyond? Being future forward? Attention to detail? Take a look at the mission and vision of the company, if they have podcasts, videos, CEO interviews, etc. so that you can do the best you can in your job application. 

Freelancing/VA-specific advice:

1. Start with an agency first. Start small. You're not going to be starting at six digits right from the get go. You need experience first as an undergrad/fresh grad. Go with an agency that puts you through training hell. I started with Athena, which is ridiculously competitive but invests a lot in its employees' education. There are a lot of agencies out there who will be able to provide the same experience. These agencies will be able to connect you with big companies abroad that you can then put into your resume. Things that you should be looking for in job hunting: dollar rates, paid training, good benefits, etc.
2. Invest in lucrative skills that businesses need most: SEO, copywriting, full stack dev, web dev, ads, data analysis, brand management, funnel building, e commerce, logistics, bookkeeping, SMM
3. Know how to use key business apps: Microsoft Suite, Google Suite, Adobe Suite, Canva, Notion, Asana, Slack, monday.com, Figma, CRMs like Salesforce and Dubsado, QBO, Shopify, Square, Squarespace, Wordpress, Lastpass, etc. One of the things employers want is less training to use the tools they're using so it helps if you can say that you're already familiar with the basics. 
4. Build a portfolio, website, or social media brand. You can do this in Canva. For freelancers, employers need proof that you're trustworthy. I recommend learning basic copywriting and web dev for this.
5. Know how to pitch / cold email. Include links to your LinkedIn, portfolio, intro video, website if you have one. The next step after spending 2-3 years in an agency is to see if you have the mettle for handling direct clients. If you've been properly marketing yourself and connecting on LinkedIn and social media, businesses and entrepreneurs should be lining up to get your Calendly link, not the other way around. However, if you're still not getting leads, you need to know how to cold email pitch.
6. If freelancing isn't for you, atleast you now have 2-3 years of experience in niche fields and you can only really go higher after that. Generally, the better practice is to quit after a few years and look for a better opportunity offering more learning experiences. Diversify your skills and experiences or hone in on a specific skill -- it's up to you. I've seen success in the former but many have also succeeded in the latter. When jumping ship though, stay for atleast 1.5 years or you might get branded as a job hopper which is a red flag. Title changes are also a big thing. Being promoted to a managerial position, and then switching almost always ensures a higher salary than the previous job. 
7. Know how to communicate properly! Study foreign cultures! International clients value transparency and competency above all. They won't have a problem if you can't do it but if you're struggling but failing to communicate, that's going to be a problem for them.
8. Always be genuine in providing service. You don't need to love your job but you do need to always find a way to excel in it if you want a job that pays six digits a month. You're being paid to be a solution, not to be a problem. Don't be a freelancer who's just going to ruin the reputation of other Filipino freelancers by charging a large rate and performing subpar :((

Overall I hope this helps! If you want even more specific advice, comment down below and I'll try to answer as soon as I can!

With that in mind, I set out to find some alternatives (with the help of Google, Claude and ChatGPT)

**All-rounder:**

* GitHub Codespaces/ vscode.dev (free for students through gh Education)
* StackBlitz (https://stackblitz.com/ free version available but has a lot of limits)
* IDX (https://idx.dev/ supports a multitude of programming languages, has AI integrated, seems to be free)
* AWS Cloud9 (https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/)

**For simple web dev stuff:**

* CodePen (https://codepen.io/)
* Code Sandbox (https://codesandbox.io/)
* JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net)

**For node.js:**

* glitch.com (also for static pages, freemium)

**For python:**

* Kaggle (https://kaggle.com offers a lot of compute power for python/others notebooks for free, plus free courses for ML/AI)
* Google Collab (collab.google.com)

These should have free tiers, but feel free to correct me or suggest others!"
1f0xmth,12,2024-08-25,Created a Tool to Help Learn ZMK Keyboard Layouts,u/ArtKaiden,ErgoMechKeyboards,https://www.reddit.com/r/ErgoMechKeyboards/comments/1f0xmth/created_a_tool_to_help_learn_zmk_keyboard_layouts/,"\*\*\[Project Showcase\] KBGlance: A Handy Tool for Learning Your Keyboard Layout\*\*

I've just finished creating a small program that I find super useful, especially since I'm still getting used to my new keyboard layout. I often forget where I've placed some of the symbols I rarely use, so I built a tool to help me out. I thought others might find it helpful too, so I'm sharing it here! 

🎥 \*\*Showcase Video\*\*: \[Watch it here\](https://youtu.be/EakkijEyYn8)

#  How It Works:

* \*\*Layer-Specific Modifier Keys\*\*: I’ve configured a key combination on each layer of my keyboard that triggers certain modifier keys along with the layer number. Since I didn't want to dedicate an entire key to this, I set up a combo using my left pinky + index finger. In my case, this triggers \`Right Ctrl + Right Alt + the layer number\`. You’ll need to set this up on each layer as each has its own unique number.
* \*\*Listening for Key Combos\*\*: The app I made listens for this key combination (it supports different combinations too) and then displays an image on the screen at the location and size you specify. The image needs to be provided by you—personally, I just took screenshots using \[Nick Coutsos' Keymap Editor\](https://nickcoutsos.github.io/keymap-editor/).
* \*\*Background Operation\*\*: The app runs quietly in the background. To close it, just find its icon in the system tray and exit from there.

# 📦 Downloads & Repo:

* \*\*GitHub Repository\*\*: \[Check out the code!\](https://github.com/CornillieJ/KBGlance)
* \*\*Latest Release\*\*: \[Download the ZIP\](https://github.com/CornillieJ/KBGlance/releases/tag/v2.0)

I'm still a computer science student, so I’d love to hear your feedback! If you find any bugs or have ideas for improvements, let me know. And if you found this tool helpful, please consider starring the repo and dropping a comment to let me know you liked it. 😊

Thanks for checking it out!

Face, Hand, & Foot Reading

*- short attention span but extremely focused ; tends to ""get it"" or ""pick it up"" in a blink of an eye ; great student.*

*- curious, loves to learn, generous with her mind, brain power, and conversation.* 

*- her heart travels all around the globe while her mind, body, and spirit remain rooted in her career & image.*

*- her heart comes back home to her bringing all experiences with it ; her brain lives out in full what the eyes of her heart have captured ; in this way she knows everything, has felt, has seen everything, has been everywhere, known everyone.* 

*- she has a High Priestessy quality thus, especially because she tends to reflect with Love and/or Truth.* 

*- sincerely benevolent ; holds people, animals, nature, and objects with sympathetic reverence and hope ; washes over their image with something honorable and empowering always that solidifies into their being.*  

*- she creates beautiful change in this world we do not directly see anywhere except reflected in her physical form ; her beauty actually is a form of majesty, pure.* 

*- she derives her confidence from her intelligence & kindness, not her looks ; she is genuinely humble and sometimes insecure about her appearance or having to rely on it, she doesn't regard it as her best feature.*  

Tarot & Dice Reading

General Energy Check:

*- Adriana is beginning to work on her career as a spiritual healer. She has faith in her gift, she has seen the ways it runs through her being in everything she does, and she would like to begin honing it, localizing and funneling her energies more directly into this at this time.* 

*- She wants to be known as a Healer so that people know they may come to her for help. She wants to use her fame to create massive channels of healing for us.* 

*-  She is experiencing bouts of impostor syndrome, for example: wondering if she is just a narcissist for thinking she is gifted in this way to help the world, or wondering if she is just trying to attach meaning to her otherwise broken identity, etc.* 

*- Of course none of these are the Truth, but this is the shadow-work aspect of becoming a healer: it is just the process of fully acknowledging that all humans engage in this form of shadow-work all the time, it's just that a healer brings it to the forefront of their mind, lets themselves die under it, and come up on the other side, clean and clear, having removed the blockage, aka the fear programming/insecurity we thought might be the scary truth.* 

*- She is seeing how those ""terrible"" aspects of her may be true or may have expressed themselves as true through her being during moments of life. She sits with this and cries and learns. She realizes over and over with each one: they were never true, but they were her unconscious belief and the belief people projected onto her that she accidentally acted on, turned into a truth, at times.* 

*- She is realizing that: as humans, first we embody and live out the ugly truth, only so that we can see what has been tricking us, holding us back, forcing us to live a manipulated identity like it; then we uncover the beauty underneath it, we realize who we are after we realize who we are not. But we do have to understand who we are not, and why, and how, and that can only happen by being that thing at least a few times in full, that's how we collect that data for our work.* 

*- And then, we teach people to do the same with the tools we learned/invented along the way, we teach people how to distinguish their Spirits from their Wounds, we teach people ""there is no such thing as an impostor but good for you, because you caught the lie and now you can start seeing your Truth. You're the opposite of an impostor and now you know, and now the whole begins knowing that, too.""* 

  
Message to Adriana from Spirit:

*- As you can see, you have already provided your own message for yourself, you're not even learning new things, you are in a period of True Remembrance of All Things. You speak to Spirit, not vice-versa; You are the Spirit we call on for guidance, you're Wisdom is timeless and boundless.* 

*- As you can see, you have also already provided a universal message to all of us, and you didn't even mean to, you were just being you, and we were just observing. This is always and forever You in everything You are and do.*

*- Thank you for everything. Your heart is the ocean humanity swims in as mermaids of a Utopian Wonder. Everything your heart knows is True. Every time you feel uncertain, well it's because it is not True. Certainty is You. Everything else is illusion however to be used as useful shadow-work.* 

*- Thank you for everything, Ancient High Priestess.* 

Message from ""Adriana"" to the People: 

*- Everywhere I go, I see Love. Our world is an extraordinary pocket of magic, how lucky we all are.* 

*- I have seen this ever since I was a child, and I did have to fight hard sometimes to hold onto this Truth, because oftentimes all we can see is hurt, pain, and hate, it has the power to consume.* 

*- And we should always let it. We should never choose to look away. When we let ourselves drown in the darkness, when we let ourselves look deeper at that which we hate or hates us, we can see more clearly what is beneath it: it is always just Love breaking free and finding a way to rise up, sometimes quickly, sometimes slowly; always, it is within its own absolute perfect timing.*  

*- It is up to us to see this, because it is our natural mode of being, our gift as humans. Each time we do this, we remember our purpose and so does the world all over again.* 

*- We are humans as much as we are Spirits. We generate this dimension with our experiences of, and inventions in, Healing ourselves and each other.* 

*- We don't fix: we remember it is already Perfect. We don't judge: we Understand, ourselves and them. We don't fear: we remember the lie.* 

*- And we cry, because that's our Truth and how we release and rise. We cry, until the tears transform into a Celebration of Clear Sight.*

1f199ae,1,2024-08-25,Have you heard of the guy who lost his whole left side? (22M),u/UnfairAcanthisitta23,MakeNewFriendsHere,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeNewFriendsHere/comments/1f199ae/have_you_heard_of_the_guy_who_lost_his_whole_left/,"He’s alright now. I love that shitty joke. I also have a shitty sense of humor. But that’s obvious, isn’t it?

I’d tell you my name, but let’s keep the anonymity on that for the time being. I like to have that kind of barrier when I’ve spoken to deranged medical students and a woman who thought she could be physically turned into a car. I wish I was joking.

I’m from Minnesota. I’m Latino and bi. I’m also a Gemini and my MBTI is ENFJ. I study business, I used to study sociology but then I dropped out of uni. Long story. I work as a server at a hotel for events such as weddings, birthday parties, business retreats. I love it and I hate it, the pay is why I’m still there.

1f1cu94,161,2024-08-25,Why Nvidia is undervalued,u/kuharido,NVDA_Stock,https://www.reddit.com/r/NVDA_Stock/comments/1f1cu94/why_nvidia_is_undervalued/,"**Let me start with the conclusion (and that this isn't financial advice)** 

* My conservative price prediction fro Nvidia is $164 in the next 12 months
* Don't expect It a straight line rise, historic annual volatility for the stock is %45.37 (sample period 2010-01-01 to 2024-08-02 ) and this has been the case even when the stock traded in single digit prices.
* I estimate topline revenue of \~200b for CY2025 which is FY ending January 2026. This is approximately 0.2% of current total global GDP. This revenue estimate is more aggressive than Wall Street projections but i believe it'll be more accurate.

**Why am i sharing this and who am I**

I've been working in tech for the past 20 years, technical degree first and business school later. For the past 10 years working almost exclusively on various ML products in big tech companies (think meta, google, twitter). My job requires technical aptitude, so i'm not a marketing type and can see through the usual sales hype. I also understand the evolution of these types of products (s curve). At the same time my job also requires me to understand adoption cycles, how to commercialize technologies and to develop some sense for what markets are willing to pay for or not.

I don't sell or do courses, lessons or ask you to sign up for anything. It's not my field and i have no interest in it either. I share for the intellectual challenge, to be helpful, and to leave a record of my predictions for accountability. 

As far as my valuation philosophy, i really don't care for P/Es and i think they are a very lazy and inaccurate way to try to understand how under or overvalued a stock is. If you've invested based on P/Es over the past decade you would have ended with slow growing stock that mostly went no where, and missed on all the opportunities that rapidly appreciate it. If you think people are overpaying for a stock, unless you have an insight that you think they don't, then consider that they might be overpaying for a reason, and no one is going to sell you a stock they think is valued at x for less. 

I also don't bind any of my analysis on other psychological comforts like what size market cap a company is. All those are biased anchors. There are some herd-like convergence naturally on some of these things but none of them drive the value whatsoever. Consider that the total value of all the US stock market 50 years ago is now the same as a few of the biggest companies collective daily moves potentially. There is no rule that says a company needs to be capped at X market cap. Ultimately, the value of a company is the total area under the curve, the curve being the cumulative cash it can generate over time. There might be deviations here and there, there might be external market and macro effects that influence that, but ultimately things converge to cash generated and earnings.

Finally, with respect to what's being done on Wall Street, and it serves its function, you have to understand that everything is a product of its context. The fact that an estimate comes from Wall Street is less indicative of the true value of a company and more indicative of just how Wall Street works. You have to consider the people who work in the industry, what's their background, what tools they use, what incentives they have .....etc . In the same manner that if you put something in a meet grinder you can predict what the output is going to look like, every industry has a systematic aspect to it that has a large impact on the output. This doesn't mean that the output is wrong, but it does mean that it is skewed and biased, and you have to contextualize against the bias to really make any use of it.

**How did i come up with this estimate?**

I took three different approaches and they all triangulated to $168 in next 12 months. I have a low/high value but i don't believe in caveated forecasts, my philosophy is a forecast is one figure that encapsulates total risk

1. DCF model for the company using my growth assumptions based on my experience in the industry
2. Estimating total AI spend and attributing how much of that will go to NVDA over the next 5 years. What i did here was list the top use cases for GPUs (beyond just LLMs) across 10 different sectors, to try to size the total spend in the AI market. I then broke that down as how i expect it to be allocated across the value chain from software costs, to operations, ML engineers, servers....etc and of course chips. I then further adjusted with assumptions on % market share that NVDA can capture within its segment of the value chain. This gives me potential total projected revenues that NVDA would earn that i then cross-referenced with the 5yr revenue projections from #1 above
3. The last method is very crude but was more of a sanity check step, which is basically taking the total spend globally and calculating it as a percent of total global GDP just to see if it makes sense (i.e not too large) and it was indeed very reasonable in low single digit percentage.

Generally, the value driven from AI is going to come along 3 axes:

* Productivity: Self explanatory but this is boosting the productivity of workers in various ways, the most obvious being LLMs like ChatGpt, Claude Sonnet, Opus, Lama...etc
* Operations: The same thing that was previously done via programming or heuristic/rule based software, can be done using ML in a more cheaper to maintain and improve manner.
* Quality/Innovation: Complete new innovations as a result from AI. Early on i expect these to come from AI as a tool facilitating discovery, in the future when we get closer to ""super AI"" it's the AI innovating.

In my estimation i took a conservative approach where i estimated AI spend that would be paid for by cost savings alone, i didn't even factor too much innovation and new use cases unlocked that would open up new markets. I'm confident that those will come along but maybe not in the next year, and frankly the possibilities are so wide and wild that i don't think i can estimate it with any reasonable confidence level so it's pointless to do so.

I'm fairly confident in my estimate, but keep in mind nothing is ever 100%. And a recession could drastically influence this as it would impact overall spend. As of right now i think it's extremely unlikely for it to drop below 80 (P.S this analysis was before the recent market correction), but it is possible. If there is a miss the market will overreact, if there is geopolitical threat the market will overreact. The antitrust stuff i'm not worried about at all, these companies always navigate those issues with very minimal impact when looking at medium and long term. In a way, the risks for NVIDIA are the risks of the market in general, not a lot specific to the company itself. Regarding China and Taiwan, i recognize this as a risk factor but i will say this, i'm not the most savvy political thinker but i think if China wanted to invade Taiwan they would have already. I also don't think it's the US keeping them ""in check"" frankly as much as it is their own regional politics and alliances.

Nvidia is the strongest in the space, it's the most differentiated, best managed, best supply chain, best vendors, and best sales channels. What they have is years ahead of anyone else with nothing in immediate sight (next 2 years at the very least) changing. They are also recognizing the value of creating an ecosystem and tightly integrated full compliment of hardware<>software for an unbeatable proposition. Other generic manufacturers aren't close, and typical tech companies who have a use for it are only creating narrow hardware very specific to what they do.

**What will happen on earnings day?**

I don't know. My best guess is next earnings is going to be good, after that there might be 1 or maybe 2 earnings that might relatively disappoint, and then up from there. This is based on the the timing i think it'll take for users to start showing the type of results they are getting from their AI related spend. They won't be fully baked in time but will be directionally clear enough to give reassurance. That said, playing earnings is a gamble. You never know who is holding what and how they will react and what information they have, it could go up it could go down.

**Why this bullish and how did you justify this?**

This all has to do with what AI is about and can do. There is a lot of misunderstanding and and misrepresentation. Just because something appreciates rapidly does not mean it's a bubble, it could be or not, you have to look at the reason of it appreciating. A penny stock getting shilled by a celebrity? Very likely a bubble. A company coming out saying they've tripled their earnings? Not a bubble. Anyways let's talk about AI a bit.

~AI Performance Vectors~

AI itself is not new, it's user-friendly and usable AI that is new. AI as a concept has been around since the 50s (Professor Marvin Miskey was one of the pioneers in the field, i've also been fortunate enough to sit in a class of his when he was still with us and teaching). The pivotal point in my opinion was around 2016, which is when a new paradigm of computing first became a reality, when the final piece of the puzzle was put in place (GPUs). In my estimation, AI was enabled piece by piece in the following order

1. The algorithms and concepts of machine learning and its various subfields (1950s till today, advancing over time)
2. Training Data (2000 was the early innings of being able to curate large training data sets, 2010s is when it really picked up)
3. Compute power (2016 GPUs)

That's all AI is, data, algorithms and compute power. I first used ChatGPT model (1) around 2018. The model was incomprehensible and i would say had no utility whatsoever. It was really more like a proof of concept. It had none of the level of reasoning that current day LLMs do, and the output was comparable perhaps to a pre-schooler, which is to say very basic in logic, full of grammatical, spelling and syntax errors. Now consider that GPT-3 in around 2023 was what blew everyone's mind away, in a short period of 5 years the improvement went from a pre-schooler to what is roughly the comprehension and ability of a high school grad or even bachelors college candidate.

Such improvements are not minor step changes, that are order of magnitude (10x) improvements stacked on top of each other. It's hard to comprehend how something like this scales. Not only this, this rate of progress, as of today is still fairly predictable, as in there are no limitations in sight for the next 4-6 years that that would hinder this rate of progress. At this rate, it's highly likely that 2-4 years from now these models will have the reasoning ability and general proficiency and competence of a top level PhD candidate from the best schools on earth. In mere seconds it'll give you what a PhD could do in a month. I'm almost certain of this because of the various improvement vectors and their yet untapped range. For example:

* Compute (probably the biggest vector)
   * Net compute power will likely increase 20x between now and then (i define net computer as the combination of the increase in raw GPU power as well as improvement in algo efficiency)
* Data
   * Most LLMs are currently trained on internet data, a lot of that can be low quality. There is work in progress to create custom high quality data sets (think articles from PhD students, inventors....etc)
   * There is research and experiments on filling data gaps using extrapolation to increase the density of data
   * Deeper learning cycles. To give an example, if you as a human are learning a text book you tend to digest chapter by chapter and progress as you build your knowledge. Machine Learning as more akin to skimming the book end to end in layers, which each layer adding more knowledge. There are ongoing experiments to optimize the level of learning considering both approaches.
* Algorithms
   * Algos currently operate in a general manner and have almost zero information about the context. Imagine being able to tie in several sources from your work, your role, goals...etc and have that aid the answers
   * More integrated across applications beyond just access to a web browser 
   * Improvements in memory management

The rate of progress is so rapid, to the point that the benchmark tests that are often though of is highly difficult and would take years to pass are being blown out in months with constant need to reset the standard. These are different benchmarks that have to do with problem solving, reasoning ...etc, think of them as tasks and problem sets that you ask the AI to solve and you compare the AI score to human ability levels.

**~AI Applications~**

To make this a bit more fun, and demonstrate the ""AI is not just ChatGPT"", here are a couple of examples. In this [paper](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec22summer_genkin.pdf)(2022) researches built an audio classifier that can processes the built in computer microphone of an online game opponent's microphone, and based on the electronic noise from the machine use that noise to know where they were on a Counter-Strike map. 

Another [example](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002176) is playing the Pink Floyd song ""Another Brick in the Wall"" to an experiment subject who has electrodes snickered to their scalp, and using only the electric activity data from the brain while its hearing the song they were able to reconstruct the song in an audio files. The song isn't 100% the same but very close and certainly identifiable. 

There are so many more examples and applications of different flavors i just happen to be into music and audio in my free time and these two i find fascinating. But my recommendation if you wish to know what's going on in the field is to forget Wall Street articles and read papers like these. Not every experiment is going to be a commercial successes, but these will help widen your perspective on the activity in the space. In any case imagine that there is a world of information out there which can be accessed if you only had the right interface. Just like there is data flying around in the air that is captured by a wifi card and a computer.

**~Pace and Incentives~**

I made the comparison earlier to pre-school, high school and PhD level performance. I didn't even mention that to ""incubate"" PhD level performance from one single person you need \~ 26 years, and the amount of people who have the ability to perform this task are limited. Imagine that you can spin up this level of performance by instantiating a process of an AI agent with one line? This is exactly why unlike many other technologies, industry and not academia is the driving force behind AI research, the returns are just too large to not pursue. Let's take a look at this data for example (From ""AI Index Report 2024""):

* in 2022: Industry produced 32 significant machine learning models, while academia produced only 3. 
* In 2023: Industry produced 51 significant machine learning models, while academia produced 15. There were an additional 21 models resulting from collaborations between industry and academia which represented a new high for such partnerships.

**Use Cases and Applications:**

I quote some studies here and there but i mostly wanted to list to show the breadth of applications of AI. There are many more i haven't listed. But my point in this is not to enumerate every single possibility, but rather show the potential of possibility. The possibility of a path to 3,4 even 5 trillion market cap and where such spend could potentially come from.

General Task Productivity

* Assisted software developers to complete programming tasks around 55% faster (Peng et al., 2023)
* Access to a generative AI assistant allowed customer support agents to resolve 14% more issues per hour (Brynjolfsson et al., 2023)
* General error reduction compared to human driven tasks within set categories

Finance and Insurance

* Fraud
* Price optimization 

Healthcare:

* Drug discovery and simulating drug interactions and efficacy
* Radio imaging diagnosis
* Personalized medicine

Operations and Supply Chain:

* Predictive maintenance
* Resource allocation

Environmental:

* Energy optimization and management

Security:

* Enhancing cybersecurity measures through real-time threat detection and response.

   * Net compute power will likely increase 20x between now and then (i define net computer as the combination of the increase in raw GPU power as well as improvement in algo efficiency)
* Data
   * Most LLMs are currently trained on internet data, a lot of that can be low quality. There is work in progress to create custom high quality data sets (think articles from PhD students, inventors....etc)
   * There is research and experiments on filling data gaps using extrapolation to increase the density of data
   * Deeper learning cycles. To give an example, if you as a human are learning a text book you tend to digest chapter by chapter and progress as you build your knowledge. Machine Learning as more akin to skimming the book end to end in layers, which each layer adding more knowledge. There are ongoing experiments to optimize the level of learning considering both approaches.
* Algorithms
   * Algos currently operate in a general manner and have almost zero information about the context. Imagine being able to tie in several sources from your work, your role, goals...etc and have that aid the answers
   * More integrated across applications beyond just access to a web browser 
   * Improvements in memory management

The rate of progress is so rapid, to the point that the benchmark tests that are often though of is highly difficult and would take years to pass are being blown out in months with constant need to reset the standard. These are different benchmarks that have to do with problem solving, reasoning ...etc, think of them as tasks and problem sets that you ask the AI to solve and you compare the AI score to human ability levels.

**~AI Applications~**

To make this a bit more fun, and demonstrate the ""AI is not just ChatGPT"", here are a couple of examples. In this [paper](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec22summer_genkin.pdf)(2022) researches built an audio classifier that can processes the built in computer microphone of an online game opponent's microphone, and based on the electronic noise from the machine use that noise to know where they were on a Counter-Strike map. 

Another [example](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002176) is playing the Pink Floyd song ""Another Brick in the Wall"" to an experiment subject who has electrodes snickered to their scalp, and using only the electric activity data from the brain while its hearing the song they were able to reconstruct the song in an audio files. The song isn't 100% the same but very close and certainly identifiable. 

There are so many more examples and applications of different flavors i just happen to be into music and audio in my free time and these two i find fascinating. But my recommendation if you wish to know what's going on in the field is to forget Wall Street articles and read papers like these. Not every experiment is going to be a commercial successes, but these will help widen your perspective on the activity in the space. In any case imagine that there is a world of information out there which can be accessed if you only had the right interface. Just like there is data flying around in the air that is captured by a wifi card and a computer.

**~Pace and Incentives~**

I made the comparison earlier to pre-school, high school and PhD level performance. I didn't even mention that to ""incubate"" PhD level performance from one single person you need \~ 26 years, and the amount of people who have the ability to perform this task are limited. Imagine that you can spin up this level of performance by instantiating a process of an AI agent with one line? This is exactly why unlike many other technologies, industry and not academia is the driving force behind AI research, the returns are just too large to not pursue. Let's take a look at this data for example (From ""AI Index Report 2024""):

* in 2022: Industry produced 32 significant machine learning models, while academia produced only 3. 
* In 2023: Industry produced 51 significant machine learning models, while academia produced 15. There were an additional 21 models resulting from collaborations between industry and academia which represented a new high for such partnerships.

**Use Cases and Applications:**

I quote some studies here and there but i mostly wanted to list to show the breadth of applications of AI. There are many more i haven't listed. But my point in this is not to enumerate every single possibility, but rather show the potential of possibility. The possibility of a path to 3,4 even 5 trillion market cap and where such spend could potentially come from.

General Task Productivity

* Assisted software developers to complete programming tasks around 55% faster (Peng et al., 2023)

1f1d70q,21,2024-08-25,Why NVIDIA is undervalued??,u/zaneguers,NvidiaStock,https://www.reddit.com/r/NvidiaStock/comments/1f1d70q/why_nvidia_is_undervalued/,"# Why Nvidia is undervalued

**Let me start with the conclusion (and that this isn't financial advice)**

* My conservative price prediction for Nvidia is $164 in the next 12 months
* Don't expect It a straight line rise, historic annual volatility for the stock is %45.37 (sample period 2010-01-01 to 2024-08-02 ) and this has been the case even when the stock traded in single digit prices.
* I estimate topline revenue of \~200b for CY2025 which is FY ending January 2026. This is approximately 0.2% of current total global GDP. This revenue estimate is more aggressive than Wall Street projections but i believe it'll be more accurate.

**Why am i sharing this and who am I**

I've been working in tech for the past 20 years, technical degree first and business school later. For the past 10 years working almost exclusively on various ML products in big tech companies (think meta, google, twitter). My job requires technical aptitude, so i'm not a marketing type and can see through the usual sales hype. I also understand the evolution of these types of products (s curve). At the same time my job also requires me to understand adoption cycles, how to commercialize technologies and to develop some sense for what markets are willing to pay for or not.

I don't sell or do courses, lessons or ask you to sign up for anything. It's not my field and i have no interest in it either. I share for the intellectual challenge, to be helpful, and to leave a record of my predictions for accountability. 

As far as my valuation philosophy, i really don't care for P/Es and i think they are a very lazy and inaccurate way to try to understand how under or overvalued a stock is. If you've invested based on P/Es over the past decade you would have ended with slow growing stock that mostly went no where, and missed on all the opportunities that rapidly appreciate it. If you think people are overpaying for a stock, unless you have an insight that you think they don't, then consider that they might be overpaying for a reason, and no one is going to sell you a stock they think is valued at x for less. 

I also don't bind any of my analysis on other psychological comforts like what size market cap a company is. All those are biased anchors. There are some herd-like convergence naturally on some of these things but none of them drive the value whatsoever. Consider that the total value of all the US stock market 50 years ago is now the same as a few of the biggest companies collective daily moves potentially. There is no rule that says a company needs to be capped at X market cap. Ultimately, the value of a company is the total area under the curve, the curve being the cumulative cash it can generate over time. There might be deviations here and there, there might be external market and macro effects that influence that, but ultimately things converge to cash generated and earnings.

Finally, with respect to what's being done on Wall Street, and it serves its function, you have to understand that everything is a product of its context. The fact that an estimate comes from Wall Street is less indicative of the true value of a company and more indicative of just how Wall Street works. You have to consider the people who work in the industry, what's their background, what tools they use, what incentives they have .....etc . In the same manner that if you put something in a meet grinder you can predict what the output is going to look like, every industry has a systematic aspect to it that has a large impact on the output. This doesn't mean that the output is wrong, but it does mean that it is skewed and biased, and you have to contextualize against the bias to really make any use of it.

**How did i come up with this estimate?**

I took three different approaches and they all triangulated to $164 in next 12 months. I have a low/high value but i don't believe in caveated forecasts, my philosophy is a forecast is one figure that encapsulates total risk

1. DCF model for the company using my growth assumptions based on my experience in the industry
2. Estimating total AI spend and attributing how much of that will go to NVDA over the next 5 years. What i did here was list the top use cases for GPUs (beyond just LLMs) across 10 different sectors, to try to size the total spend in the AI market. I then broke that down as how i expect it to be allocated across the value chain from software costs, to operations, ML engineers, servers....etc and of course chips. I then further adjusted with assumptions on % market share that NVDA can capture within its segment of the value chain. This gives me potential total projected revenues that NVDA would earn that i then cross-referenced with the 5yr revenue projections from #1 above
3. The last method is very crude but was more of a sanity check step, which is basically taking the total spend globally and calculating it as a percent of total global GDP just to see if it makes sense (i.e not too large) and it was indeed very reasonable in low single digit percentage.

Generally, the value driven from AI is going to come along 3 axes:

* Productivity: Self explanatory but this is boosting the productivity of workers in various ways, the most obvious being LLMs like ChatGpt, Claude Sonnet, Opus, Lama...etc
* Operations: The same thing that was previously done via programming or heuristic/rule based software, can be done using ML in a more cheaper to maintain and improve manner.
* Quality/Innovation: Complete new innovations as a result from AI. Early on i expect these to come from AI as a tool facilitating discovery, in the future when we get closer to ""super AI"" it's the AI innovating.

In my estimation i took a conservative approach where i estimated AI spend that would be paid for by cost savings alone, i didn't even factor too much innovation and new use cases unlocked that would open up new markets. I'm confident that those will come along but maybe not in the next year, and frankly the possibilities are so wide and wild that i don't think i can estimate it with any reasonable confidence level so it's pointless to do so.

I'm fairly confident in my estimate, but keep in mind nothing is ever 100%. And a recession could drastically influence this as it would impact overall spend. As of right now i think it's extremely unlikely for it to drop below 80 (P.S this analysis was before the recent market correction), but it is possible. If there is a miss the market will overreact, if there is geopolitical threat the market will overreact. The antitrust stuff i'm not worried about at all, these companies always navigate those issues with very minimal impact when looking at medium and long term. In a way, the risks for NVIDIA are the risks of the market in general, not a lot specific to the company itself. Regarding China and Taiwan, i recognize this as a risk factor but i will say this, i'm not the most savvy political thinker but i think if China wanted to invade Taiwan they would have already. I also don't think it's the US keeping them ""in check"" frankly as much as it is their own regional politics and alliances.

Nvidia is the strongest in the space, it's the most differentiated, best managed, best supply chain, best vendors, and best sales channels. What they have is years ahead of anyone else with nothing in immediate sight (next 2 years at the very least) changing. They are also recognizing the value of creating an ecosystem and tightly integrated full compliment of hardware<>software for an unbeatable proposition. Other generic manufacturers aren't close, and typical tech companies who have a use for it are only creating narrow hardware very specific to what they do.

**What will happen on earnings day?**

I don't know. My best guess is next earnings is going to be good, after that there might be 1 or maybe 2 earnings that might relatively disappoint, and then up from there. This is based on the the timing i think it'll take for users to start showing the type of results they are getting from their AI related spend. They won't be fully baked in time but will be directionally clear enough to give reassurance. That said, playing earnings is a gamble. You never know who is holding what and how they will react and what information they have, it could go up it could go down.

**Why this bullish and how did you justify this?**

This all has to do with what AI is about and can do. There is a lot of misunderstanding and and misrepresentation. Just because something appreciates rapidly does not mean it's a bubble, it could be or not, you have to look at the reason of it appreciating. A penny stock getting shilled by a celebrity? Very likely a bubble. A company coming out saying they've tripled their earnings? Not a bubble. Anyways let's talk about AI a bit.

\~AI Performance Vectors\~

AI itself is not new, it's user-friendly and usable AI that is new. AI as a concept has been around since the 50s (Professor Marvin Miskey was one of the pioneers in the field, i've also been fortunate enough to sit in a class of his when he was still with us and teaching). The pivotal point in my opinion was around 2016, which is when a new paradigm of computing first became a reality, when the final piece of the puzzle was put in place (GPUs). In my estimation, AI was enabled piece by piece in the following order

1. The algorithms and concepts of machine learning and its various subfields (1950s till today, advancing over time)
2. Training Data (2000 was the early innings of being able to curate large training data sets, 2010s is when it really picked up)
3. Compute power (2016 GPUs)

That's all AI is, data, algorithms and compute power. I first used ChatGPT model (1) around 2018. The model was incomprehensible and i would say had no utility whatsoever. It was really more like a proof of concept. It had none of the level of reasoning that current day LLMs do, and the output was comparable perhaps to a pre-schooler, which is to say very basic in logic, full of grammatical, spelling and syntax errors. Now consider that GPT-3 in around 2023 was what blew everyone's mind away, in a short period of 5 years the improvement went from a pre-schooler to what is roughly the comprehension and ability of a high school grad or even bachelors college candidate.

Such improvements are not minor step changes, that are order of magnitude (10x) improvements stacked on top of each other. It's hard to comprehend how something like this scales. Not only this, this rate of progress, as of today is still fairly predictable, as in there are no limitations in sight for the next 4-6 years that that would hinder this rate of progress. At this rate, it's highly likely that 2-4 years from now these models will have the reasoning ability and general proficiency and competence of a top level PhD candidate from the best schools on earth. In mere seconds it'll give you what a PhD could do in a month. I'm almost certain of this because of the various improvement vectors and their yet untapped range. For example:

* Compute (probably the biggest vector)
   * Net compute power will likely increase 20x between now and then (i define net computer as the combination of the increase in raw GPU power as well as improvement in algo efficiency)

   * Most LLMs are currently trained on internet data, a lot of that can be low quality. There is work in progress to create custom high quality data sets (think articles from PhD students, inventors....etc)
   * There is research and experiments on filling data gaps using extrapolation to increase the density of data
   * Deeper learning cycles. To give an example, if you as a human are learning a text book you tend to digest chapter by chapter and progress as you build your knowledge. Machine Learning as more akin to skimming the book end to end in layers, which each layer adding more knowledge. There are ongoing experiments to optimize the level of learning considering both approaches.
* Algorithms
   * Algos currently operate in a general manner and have almost zero information about the context. Imagine being able to tie in several sources from your work, your role, goals...etc and have that aid the answers
   * More integrated across applications beyond just access to a web browser 
   * Improvements in memory management

The rate of progress is so rapid, to the point that the benchmark tests that are often though of is highly difficult and would take years to pass are being blown out in months with constant need to reset the standard. These are different benchmarks that have to do with problem solving, reasoning ...etc, think of them as tasks and problem sets that you ask the AI to solve and you compare the AI score to human ability levels.

**\~AI Applications\~**

To make this a bit more fun, and demonstrate the ""AI is not just ChatGPT"", here are a couple of examples. In this [paper](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec22summer_genkin.pdf)(2022) researches built an audio classifier that can processes the built in computer microphone of an online game opponent's microphone, and based on the electronic noise from the machine use that noise to know where they were on a Counter-Strike map. 

Another [example](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002176) is playing the Pink Floyd song ""Another Brick in the Wall"" to an experiment subject who has electrodes snickered to their scalp, and using only the electric activity data from the brain while its hearing the song they were able to reconstruct the song in an audio files. The song isn't 100% the same but very close and certainly identifiable. 

There are so many more examples and applications of different flavors i just happen to be into music and audio in my free time and these two i find fascinating. But my recommendation if you wish to know what's going on in the field is to forget Wall Street articles and read papers like these. Not every experiment is going to be a commercial successes, but these will help widen your perspective on the activity in the space. In any case imagine that there is a world of information out there which can be accessed if you only had the right interface. Just like there is data flying around in the air that is captured by a wifi card and a computer.

**\~Pace and Incentives\~**

I made the comparison earlier to pre-school, high school and PhD level performance. I didn't even mention that to ""incubate"" PhD level performance from one single person you need \~ 26 years, and the amount of people who have the ability to perform this task are limited. Imagine that you can spin up this level of performance by instantiating a process of an AI agent with one line? This is exactly why unlike many other technologies, industry and not academia is the driving force behind AI research, the returns are just too large to not pursue. Let's take a look at this data for example (From ""AI Index Report 2024""):

* in 2022: Industry produced 32 significant machine learning models, while academia produced only 3. 
* In 2023: Industry produced 51 significant machine learning models, while academia produced 15. There were an additional 21 models resulting from collaborations between industry and academia which represented a new high for such partnerships.

**Use Cases and Applications:**

I quote some studies here and there but i mostly wanted to list to show the breadth of applications of AI. There are many more i haven't listed. But my point in this is not to enumerate every single possibility, but rather show the potential of possibility. The possibility of a path to 3,4 even 5 trillion market cap and where such spend could potentially come from.

General Task Productivity

* Assisted software developers to complete programming tasks around 55% faster (Peng et al., 2023)

1f1e66z,1,2024-08-25,"Idea: instead of funding so much on the military, why don't we call for ceasefires in Africa so that they (and we) can create startup communities and an entrepreneurial ecosystem in certain key cities? Other jobs can be created simultaneously too as in the post.",u/HelloKazoua,UnitedNations,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnitedNations/comments/1f1e66z/idea_instead_of_funding_so_much_on_the_military/,">Military spending is causing education spending to decrease immensely. According to a March 2011 report by [UNESCO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO), [armed conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_conflict) is the biggest threat to education in Africa.[^(\[38\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_Africa#cite_note-38)^(\[)[*^(citation needed)*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)^(\]) While the number of dropouts across the continent has been increasing dramatically, one of the effects of war and conflict on education is the diversion of public funds from education to military spending. An already underfunded system is losing more money. Twenty-one African countries have been identified as the highest spenders of gross domestic product on military globally compared with the amount directed toward education. Conflict also leads to the [displacement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_displacement) of children, often forcing them to remain in camps or flee to their neighboring countries where education is not available.  
**--- Wikipedia**

This can increase civilian interest in education since it would create more jobs that would be available and possibly need degrees. Maybe the UN can sanction non-profit UN startup communities in certain safer areas in Africa that could co-exist [with this](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnitedNations/comments/14lzsjh/poverty_reduction_idea_please_read_to_the_end_and/). We need (degree-holding) workers to stay in Africa since it becomes a brain drain otherwise and poor countries are taken away their skilled workers (like nurses and teachers). Couple it [with this](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnitedNations/comments/1eqqktt/idea_teach_adults_in_the_global_south_a/) and this can create a lot of jobs out of nowhere in poor countries. Many people just need jobs to exert some control of their lives instead of turning to rebellion against a hopelessness that no one cares about them or what they do.

We can even give high school students and/or college students, who tend to be volatile, an online journal for a government organization of counselors (creating Social Specialists jobs) to keep up with (every country could have their own while under [the Anti-Corruption system](https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalScience/comments/1aldjm8/idea_an_anticorruption_system/)). The students would have to select a general mood on a weekly basis (and have the option to write a short journal entry?), and there would be an algorithm (much like ChatGPT) that would be reactive to their input to keep their stress low. Their favorite classes would be indicated that would allow the journal application to provide resources to the students to learn more about those subjects, and future jobs could be explored on the site as well with descriptions provided to see what the students would be interested in. With a young generation supported mentally, there will be higher chances of students entering college or attaining jobs that they would be more informed of with more intervention from a well-intentioned government/school from drugs, violence, and a hazardous home environment. We can even collect national data that would help them to control their nation normatively when making policies that would guide the young to adulthood.

A mentally-healthy generation will lead to an economically-healthier country as time rolls on too (because they have more hope for change and to challenge hopelessness), which allows for more businesses and jobs to be created as a result (which means, more jobs for everyone). This may also create a norm for students to grow out of the stigma of looking for help when enough lives have been saved through the online journals. For example, bullying, rape, suicide, and potential school shooters could be stopped with grace and privacy as a result. Help could be personally sought if an emergency was submitted, and a counselor would discuss with those in danger of a crisis to avert it.

This journal can also help give students options and positive (algorithmic?) counseling when they are at risk of some type of Academic Dismissal during their university phase. It privately and positively walks the student through the process of Academic Dismissal and makes sure they’re not alone with bad thoughts when students choose to break down alone (which is probably what will happen with most students). Maybe it suggests music, videos, books, and links about the topic of transition, so the students don’t feel like it’s the end and show that there are still options that many have succeeded in.

>The Costa Mesa Waldorf School in California decided to take an eco-friendly approach while expanding its existing building. At Waldorf, you can find 32 individual shipping containers transformed into four classroom buildings, a library, a science lab, and a two-story auditorium.  
  
'Close the gap,' a charity aimed at bridging the digital divide, donated an IT classroom made from recycled shipping containers to an orphanage in Tanzania. The container classroom's laptops and tablets run on solar power. About 18 students now have access to the facility to learn new technology and upgrade their skills.  
[-- Source](https://www.mobilemodularcontainers.com/blog/shipping-container-schools)

Freight shipping containers can cut the cost of (multi-storied) school buildings so that more class buildings can be created. They can be modified to fit the needs of the school too. Construction and maintenance jobs can be created through this and provide some options to be built as homes too.

What other jobs and ideas do you guys think will be good for poor areas like in Africa?"

I am currently learning on what make a code clean and well-designed by reading the following books: 

* *Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship* by Robert C. Martin.
*  *Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code* by Martin Fowler.
*  *Refactoring for Software Design Smells: Managing Technical Debt* by Girish Suryanarayana, Ganesh Samarthyam, and Tushar Sharma.

And once I am done with them hopefully I will have a better understanding and how to write a better code, but as I am learning I noticed that there are things that can will need to understand the meaning of the code and what functionality it does, and this is where AI come in.

I don't have knowledge on how AI and LLM really work, so what can you guys advice me on my journey to build such tool, and do you think such tool can be built only using some LLM API like ChatGPT and a very good prompt and that's it, or thing llike this require more than a LLM with good prompt?

Well, people have joked about it for years. It is finally happening. Teachers are being replaced with computers.

I am an software developer with a passion for AI. My wife is an English teacher that has to check handwritten tests on a regular basis. 

Of course ChatGPT could already reliably check closed questions if you'd give it the answers as well. Also checking open questions is not a problem for ChatGPT anymore. The problem was the handwriting. Even the best OCR models could not reliable read handwriting. Until now.

Recently I think I cracked that problem and I am now able to reliably read some of the worst handwritings. So last week I created a simple working website as a proof of concept where you:

1. upload the test questions (as text or pictures)

2. upload the answer keys (or have ChatGPT generate the answer keys automatically from the questions)

3. use a custom webpage on your phone to take a picture of each test page and upload them to the main website with a single button. So you can just click, click, click away all pages as easy and fast as possible. Some Xerox machines als support scanning in bulk which could also work. ChatGPT automatically extracts the names of the students from the pictures if the students name is present. So you wouldn't have to manually enter all students.

4. Have ChatGPT generate a report per student listing the right and wrong answers including detailed explanations.

  
This would work for any text based test, in any language, not only for languages. Subjects like history, geography would work equally well in the exact same way. The whole process would take no longer then 15 minutes for a class of 30 students handing in 2-3 pages each. As far as I can tell something like this does not exist yet for handwritten tests. 

  
If you made all the way through my post, thanks and leave a comment."

I love that shitty joke. I also have a shitty sense of humor. But that’s obvious, isn’t it?

I’d tell you my name, but let’s keep the anonymity on that for the time being. I like to have that kind of barrier when I’ve spoken to deranged medical students and a woman who thought she could be physically turned into a car. I wish I was joking.

I’m from Minnesota. I’m Latino and bi. I’m also a Gemini and my MBTI is ENFJ. I study business, I used to study sociology but then I dropped out of uni. Long story. I work as a server at a hotel for events such as weddings, birthday parties, business retreats. I love it and I hate it, the pay is why I’m still there. 

I love listening to music, my favorite genres are rap, r&b, and alternative rock. I love to journal. I love pretty much anything art in general, traveling, learning new things, basketball and going out. Also play video games, but I haven’t had much time lately. I’m pretty much a pothead so I hope you’d be fine with that lmao. I feel like I can get along with anyone as long as you can put effort into the conversation lol. 

I’d appreciate if you tell me a bit about yourself once you message. I’m cool with moving onto a different platform later on. I’d prefer if you were from the US please so it would be easier to keep contact"

You'll get more out of it if you ask the write questions but if you treat it like a personal assistant you'd be amazed what it can do for you. I asked it this question (**What are some admin roles that teachers looking to transition out of their field can apply to?**), and this was the response:

>Teachers possess a wide range of transferable skills that are highly valuable in administrative roles. If you're considering transitioning out of teaching, here are some administrative roles that you might consider:

Hey everyone  

I will not pretend that I am in some grave situation since things could be a ton worse but I am grateful for my life. This is just me venting here and needing some wise words or a direction / advice to what I can do since I am feeling pretty stuck at the moment. Firstly, I am a computer engineering student in a university in canada going into my 4th year. I am a 20 year old guy. As you probably know, the market is terrible right now. Extremely terrible. Now, what I have been going into (one of my many mistakes that I will discuss in this very long post) is a mix of different directions. I have not really stuck to anything which is a mistake on my part. I quickly lost interest in many things. I tried a lot of courses (eg harvard’s cs50p python course (thankfully completed it), the complete 2024 web developer bootcamp by angela yu (didn’t complete it), 100 days of python bootcamp (didn’t complete it)) and a ton of tutorials. The thing is, I am not good at all in anything I’ve tried. I’ve also tried AI… everyone tells you it should be a field you look into… I thought some aspects are pretty cool, like being able to create your own model, train it, etc etc… I tried getting books only to find cryptic symbols and diagrams in every single page of it.I ended up going to my very first conference and met an ai engineer who works in amazon. He told me the field of AI and machine learning is more math than actual coding. I had a feeling that was the case but that didn’t exactly encourage me to pursue the field further, as it seemed to be a whole different world full of things that I’m not so passionate about. I am also a perfectionist (ironic since I really am not good at anything I’ve done, I cannot even start a project on my own. Except lousy number guessing games and those that courses encourage you to do). I want to be the best at what I do, I really do, and I know a ton of work and practice will go into trying to make that dream a reality, which makes me know I have to have some passion or at least not dislike what I’m doing. So I thought AI and machine learning wouldn’t be the best fields for me.

Fast forward a bit, I met a guy in university who seemed to be a genius. Anywhere I’ve seen him, he’d be coding. He told me I should try backend coding and work with him. Long story short, he meant FOR him, for free, doing projects that he wants done, and getting nothing in return, no money no recognition, and it ends up being called his project whereas I spent long nights till 4 am coding for him (or in my case using chatgpt, another mistake of mine since I feel like an imposter, but the guy had unrealistic expectations for me, telling me I should just ‘learn’ everything he wants me to do and give him results). I knew it was B.S and after many arguments and trying to end things, I ghosted him. Couple of weeks ago he sent an apology, but that’s done now. I realized I want to go into fullstack engineering, not having to rely on anyone (my other friend was also a victim of that scam, he was the frontend guy. The ‘genius’ guy convinced my friend he should go for frontend and I should go for backend. My friend was sometimes slow on getting stuff done, sometimes abandoning things. I knew I should just do things on my own and try to learn it all for myself so I wouldn’t need to depend on anyone at all. The idea seemed appealing then, that I could build any SaaS and become an independent coder who makes money on his own (I was inspired by Marc Lou, poor at first, fired from his job, made 20 something SaaS ideas, a few were successful, most failed. He was known not to be the most impressive (or impressive at all ability wise) but very consistent and hopeful which made his personality resonate with a lot of people and earned him a huge following). That failed too, ended up not continuing learning it. I have been applying for jobs since forever. Last summer I even went as far as applying in pizza places and supermarkets and in the local mall with several copies of my printed cv. No replies. When I would apply to tech companies, it usually ended in me never hearing from the company, other than that it’d be the ‘unfortunately we don’t want you but subscribe to our newsletter to stay updated’ type of email.


I am now genuinely thinking I might be unemployed when I graduate in December of 2025. The only position I’ve gotten is a position in the university to hold some sessions before midterms for some engineering courses for engineering 1st year & 2nd year students, and another was a Research assistant position in a mechanical engineering lab (arduino debugging type of work, I was told I was taken because the professor ‘felt bad’ and wanted to help me, according to him).


What do I do? Also, I’m an arab, and international students pay a lot. Thankfully my parents pay for my tuition, but I feel like I am a huge burden to them. I’ve always thought I would get rich quickly, repay them, even retire them as a much deserved thanks for their incredible work. 

Recently, my father told me to consider cybersecurity. His reasoning was that there are cyberattacks everywhere, so surely the demand must be high by all the companies, and that I might find my passion there since I loved that idea since I was a kid. Now it is true, the whole reason why I joined anything computer related, was because I’d always tell him I wanted to be a hacker. I was a kid, and as silly as it was, I used to think hacking games and things like that was the most interesting thing in the world. It felt like I was outsmarting systems created by much older people, perhaps lazy people but if a kid managed to hack (well, download a hack made by a smart person, not me) I was considering it to be very rewarding. I also thought of it this way. If physical prowess was of extreme importance back then and still is now, with out world moving to become nearly entirely technological, surely technological prowess is priceless too, right? It must be! If you were capable to always defend yourself from any attacks, had the ability and skill level to detect anything suspicious, and to be able to even inflict any damage on those trying to harm you or your family (I had imagined by asking to deal with people trying any phishing tricks or scams by family members and friends, despite knowing nothing about cybersecurity at ALL. I was a kid and saw it as almost a game. A battle, and I wanted to learn eveyrhring about this field to win any battle). 

Fast forward to now, thinking if I should do this. Again, I feel like I would be at this disadvantage, with people taking bachelors for cybersec, so they’d definitely be a lot better than me, making me pretty useless against candidates in this highly competitive field. But then again, I feel I am not good at what I have been aiming for already, so either way I would be starting from a very basic level…

It turns out I also had a TryHackMe account when I was younger (ironically, didn’t complete a single path). I find that out when I kept searching for how someone entirely new could get familiar with things. I also like the fact that it’s a lot different, my field being so focused on advanced problem-solving projects and leetcoding for tech interviews. And cybersec being mostly focused on certificates (i might be wrong). I am now in the phase of not knowing what to do, what to start with, and where to head to. It is overwhelming, maybe also because I’ve been constantly trying to get information about this huge new field that I know nothing about. Different certifications, sec+, network+, oscp, etc and different fields/roles (I find red teame to be the most interesting but apparently blue teamsrs are in much more demand). A lot of concepts are confusing like white hat grey hat black hat and if these are categories of red teamers. And if so what’s the difference between red teamers and pen testers? And also apparently there are an abundance of pen testers… but then I’ve been thinking if I should worry about competition and what’s in most demand and what pays the most since if I’m skilled enough in something, it won’t matter how much in demand it is? I don’t know though. I feel like time is running out since I will be graduating in about a year and a half, with everyone in university landing internships and then there’s me, with nothing.


If you have made it this far, I’d like to sincerely thank you for your time. I hope you can tell me what you think and what you’d do in my situation and if my thinking is wrong about any of the aspects I mentioned"

There was a lot of useful discussion between different people and with that feedback and reflection I came up with a new idea. I would like your opinion on this, could it work?

-----

When I was but a wee boy I wanted to become an archaeologist or a wildlife photographer. I spend a lot of free time reading books and looking at pictures and drawings of animals and dinosaurs. When I got older, around the age of 12, this slowly started to fade away. I never lost interest but I started to realise that these kinds of work fields are pretty hard to get into and that it isnt all as romantic as I had it in my head. I still wanted to learn more about these topics, but I never pursued them as I was too busy with school and friends and all the drama that happens around that time in most teenagers life. I ended up doing a business/manager focused study where I felt out of place. I just did it because all the rest seemed even more outside my scope. I finished it because it wasnt hard, but I was never passionate about it. After my studies I ended up in an office doing things that were not at all related to anything I had studied for the 10 years prior.

This story is something I think many people are familiar with and have experienced. How many of you remember any of the things you were forced to learn in highschool? Pretty much nothing for me. It helped me develop some writing skills and reading skills but I would have had those as well if I was learning about topics I actually enjoyed. This is not just archaeology or any kids dream jobs, but topics like wildlife conservation, history, engineering, creative writing, psychology and politics were all things I would have loved to have delved into over many of the topics that we did get. Some of these were explored in certain classes, especially history, but they never really sparked my interest due to how it was taught. 

Queue the reason why I tell you all of this: A new teaching/learning methodology. 

Imagine the following. You are 12 years old, just entered a new school and you get the freedom to pick 4 topics of your interest to learn about. You get a week to pick them. If you cant come up with something the school will provide you with 100's to pick from. It could be anything. Additionally you get 5 topics everyone has to do which would be the essentials (language, national history, math, a computer class and a topics class.) The topics class I imagine is where older students or teachers give a lesson about any topic that they are engaged in, exposing students to a variety of topics and spark new interests.

Now that you have picked your 4 topics you will be deep diving into them for 3 months. You get to write a short essay about why you like certain topics and what makes you interestedin them most. An educator (teacher) will generate a curriculum privately for you to delve into using an LLM. He will give you assignments to complete on these topics. LLM's are encouraged to use but students will have to include the sources of their information if they choose to use it. Using LLM's as a source of feedback and learning the students will enjoy engaging themselves in a topic. In the end students will be given oral examinations and give presentations which focus on argumentation and fact checking. The end result will be a grade that is not a number, but rather ""Insufficient, Sufficient or Excellent.""

So why all this? I believe that middle and highschool has so much more potential as a learning medium than it is now. As it stands students are forced to learn on topics they do not find interesting. It is demotivating. Students can learn key writing, reading and thinking skills in much more engaging way, learning more along the way if they get to explore topics that motivate them intrinsically. 

I think with the current state of ChatGPT Plus it would already be viable, but if there was an LLM focused on education and made specifically to cater to this methodology then it could be better and safer. As a side note, the importance of sourcing, fact checking should be underlined in every assignment and also taken serious by educators when providing feedback."

This is just me venting here and needing some wise words or a direction / advice to what I can do since I am feeling pretty stuck at the moment. Firstly, I am a computer engineering student in a university in canada going into my 4th year. I am a 20 year old guy. As you probably know, the market is terrible right now. Extremely terrible. Now, what I have been going into (one of my many mistakes that I will discuss in this very long post) is a mix of different directions. I have not really stuck to anything which is a mistake on my part. I quickly lost interest in many things. I tried a lot of courses (eg harvard’s cs50p python course (thankfully completed it), the complete 2024 web developer bootcamp by angela yu (didn’t complete it), 100 days of python bootcamp (didn’t complete it)) and a ton of tutorials. The thing is, I am not good at all in anything I’ve tried. I’ve also tried AI… everyone tells you it should be a field you look into… I thought some aspects are pretty cool, like being able to create your own model, train it, etc etc… I tried getting books only to find cryptic symbols and diagrams in every single page of it.I ended up going to my very first conference and met an ai engineer who works in amazon. He told me the field of AI and machine learning is more math than actual coding. I had a feeling that was the case but that didn’t exactly encourage me to pursue the field further, as it seemed to be a whole different world full of things that I’m not so passionate about. I am also a perfectionist (ironic since I really am not good at anything I’ve done, I cannot even start a project on my own. Except lousy number guessing games and those that courses encourage you to do). I want to be the best at what I do, I really do, and I know a ton of work and practice will go into trying to make that dream a reality, which makes me know I have to have some passion or at least not dislike what I’m doing. So I thought AI and machine learning wouldn’t be the best fields for me.

Fast forward a bit, I met a guy in university who seemed to be a genius. Anywhere I’ve seen him, he’d be coding. He told me I should try backend coding and work with him. Long story short, he meant FOR him, for free, doing projects that he wants done, and getting nothing in return, no money no recognition, and it ends up being called his project whereas I spent long nights till 4 am coding for him (or in my case using chatgpt, another mistake of mine since I feel like an imposter, but the guy had unrealistic expectations for me, telling me I should just ‘learn’ everything he wants me to do and give him results). I knew it was B.S and after many arguments and trying to end things, I ghosted him. Couple of weeks ago he sent an apology, but that’s done now. I realized I want to go into fullstack engineering, not having to rely on anyone (my other friend was also a victim of that scam, he was the frontend guy. The ‘genius’ guy convinced my friend he should go for frontend and I should go for backend. My friend was sometimes slow on getting stuff done, sometimes abandoning things. I knew I should just do things on my own and try to learn it all for myself so I wouldn’t need to depend on anyone at all. The idea seemed appealing then, that I could build any SaaS and become an independent coder who makes money on his own (I was inspired by Marc Lou, poor at first, fired from his job, made 20 something SaaS ideas, a few were successful, most failed. He was known not to be the most impressive (or impressive at all ability wise) but very consistent and hopeful which made his personality resonate with a lot of people and earned him a huge following). That failed too, ended up not continuing learning it. I have been applying for jobs since forever. Last summer I even went as far as applying in pizza places and supermarkets and in the local mall with several copies of my printed cv. No replies. When I would apply to tech companies, it usually ended in me never hearing from the company, other than that it’d be the ‘unfortunately we don’t want you but subscribe to our newsletter to stay updated’ type of email.


I am now genuinely thinking I might be unemployed when I graduate in December of 2025. The only position I’ve gotten is a position in the university to hold some sessions before midterms for some engineering courses for engineering 1st year & 2nd year students, and another was a Research assistant position in a mechanical engineering lab (arduino debugging type of work, I was told I was taken because the professor ‘felt bad’ and wanted to help me, according to him).


What do I do? Also, I’m an arab, and international students pay a lot. Thankfully my parents pay for my tuition, but I feel like I am a huge burden to them. I’ve always thought I would get rich quickly, repay them, even retire them as a much deserved thanks for their incredible work. 

Recently, my father told me to consider cybersecurity. His reasoning was that there are cyberattacks everywhere, so surely the demand must be high by all the companies, and that I might find my passion there since I loved that idea since I was a kid. Now it is true, the whole reason why I joined anything computer related, was because I’d always tell him I wanted to be a hacker. I was a kid, and as silly as it was, I used to think hacking games and things like that was the most interesting thing in the world. It felt like I was outsmarting systems created by much older people, perhaps lazy people but if a kid managed to hack (well, download a hack made by a smart person, not me) I was considering it to be very rewarding. I also thought of it this way. If physical prowess was of extreme importance back then and still is now, with out world moving to become nearly entirely technological, surely technological prowess is priceless too, right? It must be! If you were capable to always defend yourself from any attacks, had the ability and skill level to detect anything suspicious, and to be able to even inflict any damage on those trying to harm you or your family (I had imagined by asking to deal with people trying any phishing tricks or scams by family members and friends, despite knowing nothing about cybersecurity at ALL. I was a kid and saw it as almost a game. A battle, and I wanted to learn eveyrhring about this field to win any battle). 

Fast forward to now, thinking if I should do this. Again, I feel like I would be at this disadvantage, with people taking bachelors for cybersec, so they’d definitely be a lot better than me, making me pretty useless against candidates in this highly competitive field. But then again, I feel I am not good at what I have been aiming for already, so either way I would be starting from a very basic level…

It turns out I also had a TryHackMe account when I was younger (ironically, didn’t complete a single path). I find that out when I kept searching for how someone entirely new could get familiar with things. I also like the fact that it’s a lot different, my field being so focused on advanced problem-solving projects and leetcoding for tech interviews. And cybersec being mostly focused on certificates (i might be wrong). I am now in the phase of not knowing what to do, what to start with, and where to head to. It is overwhelming, maybe also because I’ve been constantly trying to get information about this huge new field that I know nothing about. Different certifications, sec+, network+, oscp, etc and different fields/roles (I find red teame to be the most interesting but apparently blue teamsrs are in much more demand). A lot of concepts are confusing like white hat grey hat black hat and if these are categories of red teamers. And if so what’s the difference between red teamers and pen testers? And also apparently there are an abundance of pen testers… but then I’ve been thinking if I should worry about competition and what’s in most demand and what pays the most since if I’m skilled enough in something, it won’t matter how much in demand it is? I don’t know though. I feel like time is running out since I will be graduating in about a year and a half, with everyone in university landing internships and then there’s me, with nothing.


If you have made it this far, I’d like to sincerely thank you for your time. I hope you can tell me what you think and what you’d do in my situation and if my thinking is wrong about any of the aspects I mentioned"
1f231gy,1,2024-08-26,I pass out if I am not actively interested. Help!,u/HoneySerpant,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1f231gy/i_pass_out_if_i_am_not_actively_interested_help/,"Hi! Some context of my wellbeing: Wanting some moral support or some brainstorming ideas as I cannot afford a psychiatrist right now. I am 21 and medicated on lexapro and have been for almost a decade. I have completed high school and a certificate at tafe.  I ideally want to study again…

I have a big issue where I pass out if I am not interested in something, even if I am sitting or standing. No one has helped me with this and just call me lazy of not getting enough sleep but I don’t think thats right. When I was a young kid they separated me from class because I couldn’t focus/behave like other students and instead would entertain me with playdough. They kept me with special ed support (playing games) until I stopped interrupting classes. For as long as I remember I can’t pay attention as much as I want to, my vision gets blurry, people voices sound like mumblings, and I feel extremely tired. As soon as a subject changes to something I’m interested in or I’m entertained by something I immediately feel awake and all these things are gone. 

In high school I started falling asleep in class, I never studied or did homework at home, I could only ever do it in the library with someone actively helping me otherwise I would never do it as the words would get blurry as I try to type up work. When I fell asleep I often had my head laying on my desk as I felt too tired. This was worse during covid as I didn’t participate in classes and didn’t do any work at home. This led to a lot of incomplete assessment and work but I still completed high school with moderate grades by getting extensions and asking friends for help. 

In TAFE is when it got bad. We had zoom calls due to covid outbreaks, but I would fall asleep sitting upright. I would wake up at the end of class confused, missing everything we did. I had to get extensions by reaching out to the therapist but I did not explain I fell asleep in class as I was ashamed and felt they wouldn’t understand, thinking I am just lazy as other people have called me. My partners mother helped me when I fell behind, as well as a friend in my class. I still did not learn anything from the actual classes due to my falling asleep and hearing mumbling issues. I even used chatgpt to write my paragraphs because the words were so hard to read. 

I did bring it up with a therapist how I have a hard time reading blocks of text, he gave me a paper to read to him and I read through it out loud and it was fine. He said I was fine and don’t have an issue.


This is the case in day to day life as well for example my partner watching a movie he likes but I don’t like, I fall asleep unless I am on my phone or playing a game. I generally have a hard time doing anything… Even at work I feel so tired I will pass out if I am just doing the same thing without music or a conversation. My head just doesn’t feel all here and I want it to stop, and I want to stop feeling stupid because it’s so hard to learn and do shit.

Feel free to ask questions.

TLDR: I pass out in classes and have trouble reading things."
1f252vv,1,2024-08-26,Students Who Got in Trouble for Using AI Writing,u/gptgabe,stealthgpt,https://www.reddit.com/r/stealthgpt/comments/1f252vv/students_who_got_in_trouble_for_using_ai_writing/,"Read OG post here: [https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/students-who-got-in-trouble-for-using-ai-writing](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/students-who-got-in-trouble-for-using-ai-writing)

It’s ironic, many students have faced harsh consequences for using artificial intelligence in their schoolwork, yet at the highest echelons of our educational institutions, plagiarism seems to run rampant among top tier faculty.

If you've looked into the shifting [ethics of AI and academic integrity](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/is-using-chatgpt-plagiarism-academic-dishonesty-in-dishonest-academia), it only makes sense academia would have trouble embracing a new technology like generative AI. However, students that face harsh consequences for the use of AI today aren’t going to be comforted by the full scale acceptance of the technology in the near future.

I’ve scoured the internet to find tales of students using AI-generated text and getting accused of academic misconduct because of it. These are their stories.

# Students That Got Punished

The most reported of these sad instances is [the story of Marley Stevens](https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/tech/ai/student-fights-academic-probation-ai-tool/), a college student who didn’t even use an AI chatbot to write her essay, she used Grammarly, an AI paraphraser, to proofread it. If you’ve read out [blog post about AI paraphrasers](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/will-an-ai-paraphraser-make-chatgpt-undetectable), not only do you know they’re a flawed AI tool, but you’d know that being accused of academic dishonesty for using one is ridiculous.

Speaking of dishonesty though, if you delve deeper into this story, you learn that not only were her professors advocating for using Grammarly, but the university of North Georgia advocated for it on their own website, later taking down any mention of the software after Stevens’ accusation.

Marley was put in on academic probation that she eventually overcame, but she is far from the only student that encountered academia’s hypocrisy and incompetency around AI tools.

Another case involved multiple students at Yeshiva University that used generative AI like ChatGPT to write their take home finals. The students were caught when their English professor ran their finals through AI detection software and discovered the cheating. In response, the university implemented a whole new AI policy prohibiting the use of AI writing.

Reddit is full of these stories, here’s one below. In it, the student was threatened with possible expulsion but after pleading with faculty, her grade was taken from a zero to a C so she could pass the class.

Even more commonplace than punishment for students using AI writing, is AI detection systems screwing up and delivering false positives that sour college experiences.

# False Positives and Bureaucratic Nightmares

UC Davis student [Louis Stevens](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/student-accused-ai-cheating-turnitin-1234747351/) wrote a paper summarizing a court case for a class and hours after uploading it, not only did Turnitin flag a portion of the essay, but it was immediately forwarded to the Office of Student Support and Judicial Affairs.

After being subjected to an academic integrity review, Stevens learned that the university had just integrated Turnitin which was then spouting a 98% accuracy rate. Even though she proved her innocence, this wasn’t the first case of false positives at UC Davis.

Previously that year, [William Quarterman](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2023/04/12/how-ai-detection-tool-spawned-false-cheating-case-uc-davis/11600777002/) uploaded his history exam to his professor who ran it through GPTZero and after it gave him a false positive, Quarterman was plunged into a bureaucratic nightmare before clearing his name.

These instances are certainly disheartening, but there was one case of false positive AI detection that was so egregious, it was actually funny. This was the case of a [Texas A&M professor that temporarily failed his entire class](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/texas-am-chatgpt-ai-professor-flunks-students-false-claims-1234736601/) after he ran their papers through ChatGPT and it told him that the papers were AI generated.

The class was quickly redeemed and the story goes on to be retold as an example of academic institutional incompetence.

# Do AI Detectors Work?

There wouldn’t be a whole section about false positives if they did what they were supposed to do. Higher education simply doesn’t see another option. They don’t want students to skirt the learning process and not develop the critical thinking faculties that come with it. So, they employ bad technology. Even MIT published this report declaring that [AI detectors don’t work](https://mitsloanedtech.mit.edu/ai/teach/ai-detectors-dont-work/).

As far as Turnitin goes, they claim to have a 4% false positive rate at the sentence level. That means for the millions of AI generated essays that get processed, there are countless false positives that are reported and just as many probably being neglected by faculty that understand the technology sucks.

The problem is simply in the algorithm. AI detectors are taught to check for the watermarks of AI writing, meaning simple and precise word choice, sentence structure, and sentence length, and it’s not like those can’t be exhibited in human writing.

Stanford even did a study that found AI detectors show a bias toward Non-native English speakers and international students for this reason.

As you can see above, each detector tested showed bias against non-native English speakers.

# How to Bypass AI Detectors

In order to bypass AI Detectors like Turnitin, you need to use an undetectable AI service like StealthGPT. By humanizing AI text and removing the watermarks of AI writing, StealthGPT makes any content it generates human feeling enough for no person or detector to consider it AI generated.

If these students used StealthGPT, they would’ve never been caught in the first place, even when they wrote their own essays, StealthGPT knows how to avoid the pitfalls of AI detection that not even human writers are aware of.

If you want to learn [how to bypass AI detectors](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/bypassing-ai-detectors-stealthgpt) with StealthGPT read our blog.

# What to do if you get caught using AI

Lets say you’ve been accused of academic dishonesty. What do you do next? Here are the necessary steps to take to protect yourself:

* When responding to a failing grade or AI-usage accusation, be polite and assertive of your innocence.
* If this does not work, go to your student affairs office and get further direction.
* You will need evidence of your innocence so be prepared with documents showing your history with the assignment and preparation for it.
* Do your own research and compile sources that testify to the faultiness of AI detectors.
* Try to get witness testimony of your working on the project.

And remember, when you’re in front of a judicial committee, it’s often the case you can have a lawyer present if you feel that's neccesary.

# Conclusion

When OpenAI created ChatGPT, they had to know students would use it for school work. Academia hasn’t exactly reacted to the technological shift gracefully, instead they’ve imposed restrictive measures and turned campuses into climates of suspicion.

Universities need to accept the fact AI will fully integrate into learning and teaching. Teachers will use it for everything from creating syllabi to curricula and students will use it for homework. The only way to ensure they don’t use AI is to host more in-person assignments, which you should fully expect to happen.

If you want to use AI writing tools for your essays, don’t be swayed by outdated notions of academic integrity to avoid using what technology is available to you. Work smarter and get StealthGPT to avoid AI detection in the first place.

StealthGPT bypasses every major AI detection software with unparalleled ease. We now offer a student discount that lets you subscribe to one of our plans at only .99 cents for the first month. Students that join StealthGPT become part of a community with thousands of users that have unlocked their potential using AI.

Don’t get left behind. AI doesn’t hinder your development, it lets you take proven shortcuts to success instead of wasting time.

# FAQ

# How Common Is AI Cheating in Schools?

There are multiple reports with varying answers, all of which are damning to academia for the frequency in which students use AI to generate their schoolwork. Here’s just one of many reports, this one claims only 20% of students say they’ve never used AI. Also, take into consideration that someone people wouldn’t tell you if they were polled.

With such a high rate of students using AI, it’s hardly fair to call them cheaters. They’re just young people growing up in a technological revolution is all.

# Is there a free AI Detection tool?

Yes. Multiple free AI detection tools exist. The best of which is AI Detect because it also features a humanizer, making it a one stop shop for all students and content creators.

# Is there a free Undetectable AI tool?

Yes. StealthGPT offers a free trial version to their software which allows you to use their AI humanizer and Stealth Writer for free and without any word limits. StealthGPT is not like other chat bots, we’re the kings of undetectable AI."
1f29fls,1,2024-08-27,Should I talk to my professor about allowing us to use AI for a project?,u/catboygod,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1f29fls/should_i_talk_to_my_professor_about_allowing_us/,"Apologies if this is a long one, I’m a certified yapper and I’m also just passionate about the topic. So I’m a college student who is studying theatre and this semester I enrolled in a costuming class. Although acting is my main goal, I’m very passionate about costume design as well as fashion. Today was my first day of the class, my teacher seems nice and I’m honestly ecstatic to improve my sewing skills. But when we started discussing our final project, something she said threw me off hard. For our final, we are required to provide costume design
renders for the characters of the play we are assigned before turning them into our final garments. I’m also an illustrator and character design is my speciality, so I was super stoked about this. I did a very similar final for my gen theater class last year and had a blast. I was happy until she said that we were allowed to use AI for our final renders. Now I’m a VERY avid hater of AI and an outspoken advocate against it since it started taking over the art world. I’ve been thinking about this since I got out of class about 4 hours ago and my anger and discomfort about it keeps growing. I’m far from a confrontational person but I think I would have a hard time letting this go. If I did talk to my professor my argument would be as follows:

What of academic integrity? If someone in a composition class turned in an essay written entirely by ChatGPT and they were caught, would they not be failed for that? Why is an any different just because it’s art? As per the syllabus, the designs should be original. There is nothing original about AI art. Someone could easily put in the name of the play and the characters name and get a design without and ounce of creativity behind it. I am aware not everyone in the class is there because they want to learn costuming seriously. Some are there to fulfill a credit, others just for fun. However, costume renders are a part of the trade, it is an essential skill to have when designing costumes even if you are not the next Michelangelo creating masterpieces for every render. The class is a costuming class, not just a sewing class. If it’s a fundamental aspect to the subject of the class that we are paying to be in, why let people cheat out on it altogether? 

My professor stated that as long as effort is put into your work, you will not fail, and that most people will get an A. I can look past that, I’m not competing with anyone and yes some people are doing it to fulfill a credit and don’t have any sort of interesting in drawing or even costuming. That’s fine. Even if their work is scribbles on a printed outline, or even a compilation of existing clothing pieces compiled to make an outfit, that would still be better than typing a word or two into a box and getting entirely stolen “art” lifeless mush. It saddens me to think that myself and others of my classmates will be putting genuine effort into our projects only to receive the same grade as someone who didn’t even bother to pick up a pencil. I feel very uncomfortable with such a person as influential as a professor endorsing AI and even letting people turn it in. 

I don’t think I can in my good conscience keep my mouth shut about this, so regardless of my initial question I’ll probably still do it. So I guess my real question is how should I approach this? I don’t want to overstep, this is her class and I can’t decide anything for her in the end. I don’t know if she’s unaware of how AI works or just doesn’t care. I’m really hoping it’s not the latter to be honest. Maybe I should talk to some classmates to see their opinion on it and maybe several of us could talk to her about it? I don’t want to gang up on her either, I’d like to approach this as professionally as possible. I’m not going to drop the class regardless of her answer because even though I’m super uncomfy with this whole situation, this is my only chance to take the class for an entire year and she’s the only professor who teaches it. 

Also for any AI bros in the comments who will try to change my mind about AI: save it. I do not give a fuck. "

The history of graphics and design is a rich and evolving story that spans centuries, reflecting the cultural, technological, and social changes of the times. We will see. Step by step, the graphics design's development 

1. Prehistoric and Ancient Times

Cave Paintings (c. 30,000 BCE–10,000 BCE): Some of the earliest known graphic expressions are found in cave paintings, such as those in Lascaux, France, depicting animals, human figures, and abstract symbols. These helped as early forms of communication with others and story-telling.

Egyptian Hieroglyphics (c. 3200 BCE–400 CE): The Egyptians developed an elaborate system of writing and symbolism that was both functional and decorative. Their use of pictorial symbols to convey information laid the foundation for later graphic communication.

# 2. Classical Antiquity

Greek and Roman Art (c. 800 BCE–400 CE): The Greeks and Romans made significant contributions to the development of typography and visual design. Roman inscriptions, often carved in stone, demonstrated an early understanding of type design and layout.

Mosaics and Frescoes: The Romans were also known for their intricate mosaics and frescoes, which combined imagery and text to tell stories and decorate public spaces.

# 3. The Middle Ages

Illuminated Manuscripts (c. 400–1400): Monks in medieval Europe produced illuminated manuscripts, which were hand-copied books decorated with elaborate borders, initials, and illustrations. These works combined text and image in ways that influenced later graphic design.

Heraldry: The system of heraldry, which emerged in the Middle Ages, involved the design of coats of arms and symbols used for identification on the battlefield and in society. This practice contributed to the development of graphic symbols and logos.

# 4. The Renaissance (c. 1400–1600)

Invention of the Printing Press (c. 1440): Johannes Gutenberg's invention of the printing press revolutionized graphic design by making it possible to produce multiple copies of texts and images quickly and efficiently. The design of typefaces, page layout, and book illustration became important areas of focus.

Rise of Typography: The Renaissance saw the development of new typefaces, such as the Roman and Italic styles, which were more legible and aesthetically pleasing. Typography became an art form, with designers like Aldus Manutius and Claude Garamond creating typefaces that are still in use today.

# 5. The Industrial Revolution (c. 1760–1840)

Mass Production: The Industrial Revolution brought about the mass production of printed materials, leading to the widespread availability of books, posters, and advertisements. This time period saw the rise and development of graphic design as a profession.

Lithography: Invented by Alois Senefelder in 1796, lithography allowed for the mass production of images and text, leading to the proliferation of posters, packaging, and other printed materials.

# 6. The 19th and Early 20th Centuries

Art Nouveau (c. 1890–1910): This decorative art movement influenced graphic design with its emphasis on organic forms, flowing lines, and the integration of text and image. Designers like Alphonse Mucha created iconic posters and advertisements in this style.

Modernism (c. 1920–1960): The early 20th century saw the rise of modernist design principles, emphasizing simplicity, functionality, and the use of abstract forms. The Bauhaus school in Germany played a key role in shaping modern graphic design, with designers like Paul Rand and El Lissitzky leading the way.



7. The Digital Age (c. 1980–present)

Computer Graphics and Desktop Publishing: The advent of computers and software like Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign revolutionized graphic design, allowing designers to create and manipulate images with unprecedented precision and flexibility.

Web Design: The rise of the internet in the 1990s brought new challenges and opportunities for graphic designers. Web design became a key area of focus, with designers creating user interfaces, websites, and digital experiences.

Motion Graphics and 3D Design: Advances in technology have also enabled the development of motion graphics and 3D design, expanding the possibilities for visual storytelling and communication.

# 8. Contemporary Design Trends

Minimalism: Today, minimalism continues to be a dominant trend in graphic design, emphasizing simplicity, clarity, and the use of negative space.

Responsive Design: With the proliferation of mobile devices, responsive design has become crucial, ensuring that visual content adapts to different screen sizes and orientations.

Sustainability: As environmental concerns grow, sustainable design practices, such as eco-friendly packaging and materials, are becoming increasingly important in the field of graphic design.**Uses of Graphics Designing**

Graphic design is a versatile field that serves numerous purposes across various industries. Here are some key uses of graphic design:

**History of graphics and design**

The history of graphics and design is a rich and evolving story that spans centuries, reflecting the cultural, technological, and social changes of the times. We will see. Step by step, the graphics design's development 

1. Prehistoric and Ancient Times

Cave Paintings (c. 30,000 BCE–10,000 BCE): Some of the earliest known graphic expressions are found in cave paintings, such as those in Lascaux, France, depicting animals, human figures, and abstract symbols. These helped as early forms of communication with others and story-telling.

Egyptian Hieroglyphics (c. 3200 BCE–400 CE): The Egyptians developed an elaborate system of writing and symbolism that was both functional and decorative. Their use of pictorial symbols to convey information laid the foundation for later graphic communication.

# 2. Classical Antiquity

Greek and Roman Art (c. 800 BCE–400 CE): The Greeks and Romans made significant contributions to the development of typography and visual design. Roman inscriptions, often carved in stone, demonstrated an early understanding of type design and layout.

Mosaics and Frescoes: The Romans were also known for their intricate mosaics and frescoes, which combined imagery and text to tell stories and decorate public spaces.

# 3. The Middle Ages

Illuminated Manuscripts (c. 400–1400): Monks in medieval Europe produced illuminated manuscripts, which were hand-copied books decorated with elaborate borders, initials, and illustrations. These works combined text and image in ways that influenced later graphic design.

Heraldry: The system of heraldry, which emerged in the Middle Ages, involved the design of coats of arms and symbols used for identification on the battlefield and in society. This practice contributed to the development of graphic symbols and logos.

# 4. The Renaissance (c. 1400–1600)

Invention of the Printing Press (c. 1440): Johannes Gutenberg's invention of the printing press revolutionized graphic design by making it possible to produce multiple copies of texts and images quickly and efficiently. The design of typefaces, page layout, and book illustration became important areas of focus.

Rise of Typography: The Renaissance saw the development of new typefaces, such as the Roman and Italic styles, which were more legible and aesthetically pleasing. Typography became an art form, with designers like Aldus Manutius and Claude Garamond creating typefaces that are still in use today.

# 5. The Industrial Revolution (c. 1760–1840)

Mass Production: The Industrial Revolution brought about the mass production of printed materials, leading to the widespread availability of books, posters, and advertisements. This time period saw the rise and development of graphic design as a profession.

Lithography: Invented by Alois Senefelder in 1796, lithography allowed for the mass production of images and text, leading to the proliferation of posters, packaging, and other printed materials.

# 6. The 19th and Early 20th Centuries

Art Nouveau (c. 1890–1910): This decorative art movement influenced graphic design with its emphasis on organic forms, flowing lines, and the integration of text and image. Designers like Alphonse Mucha created iconic posters and advertisements in this style.

Modernism (c. 1920–1960): The early 20th century saw the rise of modernist design principles, emphasizing simplicity, functionality, and the use of abstract forms. The Bauhaus school in Germany played a key role in shaping modern graphic design, with designers like Paul Rand and El Lissitzky leading the way."

Aging is a biological process that no one can avoid. Ideally, growing old should be a time to relax and enjoy the fruits of your labor. Aging also has a darker side, however, often linked to disease. Every second, your cells perform billions of biochemical reactions that fuel essential functions for life, forming a highly interconnected metabolic network. This network enables cells to grow, proliferate and repair themselves, and its disruption can drive the aging process. But does aging cause metabolic decline, or does metabolic disruption accelerate aging? Or both?

1f2d0u3,1,2024-08-27,Life Pro Tip: Boost your productivity in exacting retribution upon your professors with AutoHotKey and ChatGPT,u/WaterCereal266,DeAnza,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeAnza/comments/1f2d0u3/life_pro_tip_boost_your_productivity_in_exacting/,"**DISCLAIMER**: This is purely hypothetical and I do not encourage any students to take petty vengeance on their professors out of spite. With that said, I'll admit that I've personally used this method against all three of the De Anza professors who did not give me an A, as well as the professor from last quarter whose class I dropped (for a W). 

Now, we all know that you can spend $5 to buy fake reviews online, probably from some third world country like Bangladesh, where $5 feeds a family of 12 for a month and no one bats an eye at child labor. If you're an average person like me, you've probably ran into countless situations where you wanted to use these services, but hesitated upon imagining children chained to keyboards in a dimly lit slave camp. Worry not, as I have a solution that allows you to bot hundreds of RMP reviews from the comfort of your home, **without exploiting children.**   
  
First, you'll have to install AutoHotKey (AHK). You could opt for a simpler alternative like Macro Recorder, but on a task like this which requires both precision and variation, you may face roadblocks. I strongly recommend that you check out AHK, writing scripts for it may be tedious, but it dwarfs any competitor in both flexibility and customization. With that said, I'm only here to impart knowledge, so I won't be uploading my full script. Creating is part of the fun (though pleasure is derived from watching the prof's rating drop), so if you're a beginner, feel free to message me for help. 

Depending on where you choose to store your AI-generated reviews, your script will differ, but the rough idea remains the same. Grab a review from Google Sheets (what I personally use), open a new RMP window with your prof's link, click the rate button, and click through the prompts. A trick I use to avoid raising eyebrows is generating a random offset to select the course code from the dropdown list, so that the ratings are evenly distributed and not all clustered in PHYS69D (example). You may have to adjust the parameter depending on how many courses are listed on your professor's page, so that the script doesn't click outside the list's bounds. I also do this for the *Select up to 3 tags* section, but if you just want to get the script up and running, you can skip ahead to the Write Review section. 

Even if you come from a programming background, if you don't have past experience with AHK, the syntax and key presses may pose a challenge. The process demands lots of trial and error, but bear in mind—all your efforts and struggles will make your revenge taste that much sweeter, as you ravage your professor's RMP page to a point beyond rescue. For your convenience, below are some tips (coming from personal experience).

* Window Spy is a tool that comes with the AHK installation, and will display the current mouse pointer coordinates. You'll need this information when you write the script telling the mouse to click at a certain position. UI will be scaled and placed differently depending on the monitor's resolution, so you'll have to find what works on your device.
* Sleep <duration> is crucial. The script will delay for the specified duration before moving onto the next instruction, which is key when dealing with a website that may buffer for an unspecified length of time. I'd suggest you place a generous delay upon loading the website, as you don't want the script to begin scrolling and clicking while the page is loading. 
* [The official AHK forum](https://www.autohotkey.com/board/) is a useful resource with a number of great questions and answers, similar to Stack Overflow. 
* r/AutoHotkey is less useful, but you can still find some relevant posts.

Finally, we arrive at the last section of leaving a rating, the *Write a Review* section. This is where the script pastes the ChatGPT review it grabbed from Google Sheets/storage of your choice. Experiment and use whatever prompt you want to generate the reviews, I use a generic one that I'll leave at the bottom of this post. Once the reviews are fully generated, simply copy and paste them to Sheets, and they should be formatted nicely into individual cells, ready for the script to grab. In my script, I do this by accessing the Name box (ctrl+j) and entering the cell number, which I increment in the loop. This brings me to the cell, so all I have to do next is select all and copy. 

Well, there you have it, a way to get back at your worst professors. Some will claim that they don't look at RMP or that they don't care about their rating, but let's face it: Sooner or later they're bound to check, and having an abysmal rating can't help their confidence. If you're someone concerned with morals, blame RMP for not adding restrictions against bots. If you have any ideas for more efficient implementation, please reach out. I'd love to work together and turn this into a project that's widely accessible to college students. I'm currently looking into using threading with Python, as using AHK as a macro comes with the glaring flaw that I'm unable to use my device for other purposes while the script is running. It doesn't bother me too much, as I generally run the script with around 50-100 reviews overnight, but an improvement would be nice. 

The prompt I use:

Hi ChatGPT, I need your help to draft multiple reviews for <professor's name>, who I believe is not meeting the expectations of their role. Please generate 50 reviews that highlight various issues with their teaching. Focus on the following points:   
- Poor communication skills   
- Lack of organization in lectures   
- Unavailability for student support   
- Unfair grading practices   
- Ineffective teaching methods   
Each review should be realistic, detailed, and provide specific examples where possible. Vary your tone and syntax to create the impression that each review is written by a unique college student. Limit the reviews to 350 characters. Thanks!

Project Description:
So, I use ChatGPT 4o a lot when trying to understand a topic. I love how conversational it is rather than reading through whole pages of documentation.
So my idea is to include a document/webpage scraper into a chatbot so that it can answer questions on a specific topic.

For example, I have a test coming up and I have a PDF that explains the 7 layers of the OSI Model. The PDF is very boring and has no pictures so since I have the attention span of a 3-year-old, I'd like to understand it in a different way.

I understand how tokenisation and probability factors into GPT not giving the ""correct"" answers sometimes, but I think it would help me personally if no one else to get a better understanding of any topic first before rereading etc.

Main Question:
Ok so, I have the scraper done and dusted, my main problem is the conversational and contextual aspects. Since I am poor and a student, I don't want to pay for OpenAI's API to use GPT 4o, also it seems like a cop out to me since I want to understand how it works more. I am currently using the distilbert-base-cased-distilled-squad model from Hugging Face's Transformers library but that isn't good for conversations (as I've found out lol).
What's the best recommended budget model that is most similar to GPT4o?

TL;DR
What's the best budget model for a conversational chatbot that only talks about user-specified content?

1f2oxil,47,2024-08-27,I'm teaching AI to a group of High school kids that are neurodivergent. Here's how it's going. ,u/ResponsibleAd8287,OpenAI,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1f2oxil/im_teaching_ai_to_a_group_of_high_school_kids/,"# Teaching AI to NeuroSpicy Students: A Journey of Innovation and Fun

Greetings from sunny Florida! I’m a teacher at a small private school where I have the freedom to craft my own curriculum. My classroom is a vibrant mix of neurodivergent students, affectionately known as “NeuroSpicy.” We embrace every 'Tism under the sun—dyslexia, dyscalculia, dysgraphia, and more. It’s a lively bunch of six kids, each with unique challenges and incredible potential.

# The AI Class Adventure

I embarked on an exciting journey to teach my students how AI can enhance their everyday lives. I developed an 8-part series focused on prompt engineering, using a blend of ChatGPT 4.0 and Co-Pilot. The series kicks off with AI terminology and definitions, and wraps up with a deep dive into the ethical implications of AI. We tackle thought-provoking questions like, “If you create a T-shirt design using AI, who owns the image?” and “Is it ethical to sell AI-generated art?”

# A Success Story: From Struggles to Triumph

One of my students, a 15-year-old with severe spelling and reading difficulties, has been working on a book about his hyper fixation—Dungeons & Dragons. Despite his intellectual challenges, he’s written over 13,000 words across three chapters, thanks to AI. His mother has never seen him so proud. Our goal is to publish his book on Amazon, proving that he can achieve something remarkable and potentially support himself in the future.

# Integrating AI Across Subjects

AI isn’t just for writing; we use it to teach math, science, grammar, interactive games, and coding. I’m constantly exploring new projects and real-world applications for this technology. The results have been phenomenal, and my students are more engaged than ever.

# Encouragement for Fellow Educators

If you’re considering teaching AI, go for it! Use tools like Co-Pilot to develop your curriculum. It’s been a game-changer for my students, and I’m confident it can be for yours too. Thanks for coming to my TED Talk!

I teach a small private school in Florida where i have total control over curriculum. I had an idea to start to teaching them how AI could really benefit them in the everyday world they live. I have kids that are the full spectrum of being NeuroSpicy as we call it. Pretty much every 'Tism is represented. Dyslexia, dyscalculia, dysgraphia, all types of spelling issues, calculating, social, maturity and everything in between are in my class of 6 kids.   
  
What do I do in my AI class? I have built an 8 part series that is teaching them how to engineer prompts. I have looked all over the internet trying to find an actual curriculum that teaches the fundamentals of AI and how to implement those fundamentals. So I started using a combination of ChatGPT 4o and Co-Pilot. The series starts with terminology and definitions of the words that are used for AI and I finish with what are the ethical implications of using AI. I ask questions like ""just because you tell AI how you want a picture to look, then you edit that until you have it exactly how you want it, and then you take that and turn it into a T-Shirt design and sell it.....who owns that image?"" ""Is it okay to sell it if you didn't actually put pen/paint brush to paper to create that art""? It has been a fascinating conversation so far.   
  
I have a kid (15 year old), that cannot spell due to several diagnosis and truly struggles with reading, is in the middle of writing a book for his hyper fixation (DnD) that is truly great. He was my guinea pig last year. I taught him how to tell AI who the characters are, how they are related, what is their backstory, the environment, so on and so on and now he has 3 chapters with well over 13,000 words done. He feels so incredibly accomplished by this and his mother says it is the most proud she has ever seen him about anything. Now this is a student that also has pretty severe intellectual issues. He will forever be around a 10 year old. My idea is for him to complete the book and see if we can get it published on Amazon. If it sells 10 copies it can prove that he can provide for himself one day. He can, with enough work, feel accomplished on yet another level that he before thought would be impossible.   


I'm using it to teach math, science concepts, writing, grammar, interactive games, coding and I'm still trying to dig up new projects and real world usage for this technology.   
So if you want to teach your class AI....do it. Find a way to make it happen. I used Co-Pilot to develop my entire curriculum. So far it has been super successful. My kids love it and I can't help but think your kids will as well. Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk.    "

Researchers at Washington State University recently developed an AI technique called Bayesian Optimization that dramatically improves the speed and efficiency of 3D printing lifelike human organs.

* The AI balances geometric precision, density, and printing time to create organ models that look and feel authentic.
* In tests, it printed 60 continually improving versions of kidney and prostate organ models.
* This approach significantly reduces the time and materials needed to find optimal 3D printing settings for complex objects.
* The technology also has potential applications beyond medicine — for example, in the computer science, automotive, and aviation industries.

With cheaper, lifelike 3D-printed human organs, medical students could better practice for surgery before operating on actual patients. Beyond medicine, this AI technique could help reduce manufacturing costs for a variety of things like smartphones, car parts, and even airplane components.

1f2qwby,1,2024-08-27,Help me ascertain the potential depth of security breach by my roommate,u/Educational_Map_1369,opsec,https://www.reddit.com/r/opsec/comments/1f2qwby/help_me_ascertain_the_potential_depth_of_security/,"So, last week I made a detailed post that listed the clues to what I suspected a potential *remote security breach* on my mobile device. Here's a link to that post if you are keen on taking a deeper look into the situation. However, I have summarized that post concisely (below the link) with the help of chatGPT for the readers' convenience. 

> https://www.reddit.com/r/opsec/s/S91GHoYVWM

> ### Summary of the Reddit Post:  
> - **Issue:** User experienced a data breach with fraudulent transactions on their savings account.
> - **Initial Incidents:** Unauthorized Interac e-transfers of $499 and $963; suspicious draft email and browser tabs noticed on their Samsung Galaxy S24.
> - **Actions Taken:** Reset passwords, reported to banks, followed bank instructions to reset the phone.
> - **Further Incidents:** 10 days later, further attempts to access banking accounts and Remitly app; transactions declined by the bank and the app.
> - **Bank's Investigation:** Determined the incident occurred from the user's phone and IP address.
> - **Uncertainty:** User seeks help in understanding whether their banking credentials are compromised or if their phone is hacked despite resetting everything.


Now, I have had experienced further developments which *essentially* makes the cause crystal clear. Turns out, it was my roommate all along. I moved into this residence just this month. As days passed living with him, I noticed that he takes some kinds of drugs too. Owing to my innocent nature and absence of an encounter with any malevolent individual in my 23 years of life, I foolishly told him my phone and laptop passwords when he asked for them on separate occasions. I have learned the lesson the hard way now by losing out 1500$. Besides, I would like you to not diverge on educating me on my lack of sense of security (already recieved alot), and focus on the more important part written ahead that I would appreciate your feedback on. 

So, as explained in the summary, I had changed my passwords and reset the mobile phone and increased my security as much as I could (2FA, strong random generated passwords not saved anywhere, removed biometrics etc.) As a result, the following two-three attempts after the initial attempt were unsuccessful by him. 

Now, last night he again tried to access my phone while I was sleeping. By god's grace i got up from sleep at around 3:30 pm when he was in probably in the middle of his process as he was doing something on his iPhone. As soon as I woke up, he went to sleep and told me that my phone was making a sound (he panickedly just said this to divert my attention). 

Nevertheless, the new revealing thing that I noticed is that since my phone was locked, the only thing that I, and he *probably*, could see on notification screen was some notifications. It was just text SMS messages from an unknown number. The content of each of the 5-6 messages was just a plain dot (period). I checked notifications history log for the messages app from settings and found that those messages were sent minutes apart between 2:20 AM and 2:56 AM. The logs also contained something titled 'custom app notification' and the content was 'Messages is doing work in the background'. 

**Now this is essentially the **crux** of my post and curiosity that what kind of technique is this? And what's the depth of breach he could do in this way?** Relieving news is I have made the homeowners aware of the incidents and  have told him to evict the place before this month ends. I have numerous subtle and concrete proofs too, which can be used to get him punished. But I am refraining to file a police report for now in consideration of his future as an international student here in Canada.

1f32irj,131,2024-08-28,1 Month Progress on Leetcode,u/No-Half-9879,leetcode,https://www.reddit.com/r/leetcode/comments/1f32irj/1_month_progress_on_leetcode/,"https://preview.redd.it/rj62s5y88cld1.png?width=856&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6e0fb6880e8f91b1ba5f9f1274b81b0b62f056e

Here is my first month of doing Leetcode properly. Am a maths student but have done DSA at uni as an optional module. I'm at the point where easys are (mostly) actually easy, and I can solve most mediums, but not quickly. I did the top interview 150 and the Leetcode 75. Here are a few things I learned:

- If an optimisation-type problem seems too high in complexity to brute force, there is often a simpler greedy approach.

- If you have spent a lot of time on a problem already, asking chatgpt for hints (not code) can be helpful, if you really struggle ask for pseudocode because then you still have to implement it and likely will understand the solution a bit more as you code it.

- Dynamic programming questions (easy/medium ones) usually boil down to defining a subproblem, and then finding a recurrence relation between these subproblem solutions, its helpful to do this on paper, then implementing the code is usually straightforward if you figure that part out.

- Dfs / Bfs, it's worth learning how to do them both iteratively and recursively, iterative tends to be faster, recursive is usually easier to implement, it clicked once i made the connections between stack and dfs, and queue and bfs.

- Learning to keep track of the time complexity of your solution, and evaluate whether it could be improved is useful, and TLE errors can sometimes be resolved by using sets/dictionaries instead of arrays where possible

- For patterns you have never seen before, it's worth taking the time to watch videos or read online and make notes, before attempting a problem

  
How would people recommend proceeding from here? Also if any people (Uk based is helpful) want to connect and discuss solutions / approaches on discord or similar feel free to shoot me a message.

1f35azh,165,2024-08-28,How to use ChatGPT properly ,u/Inerty025,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1f35azh/how_to_use_chatgpt_properly/,"Hi everyone,   
I am a consultant in AI, and **I’m currently conducting sessions to explain to employees how to use ChatGPT properly**. I’m quite concerned about the overuse of AI in the education system, with several professors noting that while homework is getting done, students aren’t learning as much anymore. Personally, I’m super happy I graduated before ChatGPT was released—it would have been so tempting to use it all the time. The real issue is how people are using ChatGPT: most people are lazy (we’re human, it’s in our nature) and use it as a replacement for themselves—drafting plans, writing emails from scratch, doing homework—basically any cognitive functions that we normally engage in on a daily basis. I myself overused ChatGPT during my PhD and noticed that I was losing my ability to construct complex sentences and think for myself. That was a bit freaky; there’s an addictive quality to using it. So, I took a step back and started reading some articles on AI use.

In the corporate world, it’s a bit different. People are often conservative, and it takes time to get them to use new tools. However, I want to teach them good practices.

I started to think about very **simple rules that you can apply at work to use ChatGPT in a beneficial way**: being effective when you need to be, learning when you don’t know something, and getting feedback to verify the scope of your task. I created this chart to outline these rules:

[Rules to use ChatGPT](https://preview.redd.it/3nuovp5tbdld1.png?width=2753&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f3ff3abd60f9e91e6f4e5d2b16c3c70d9ae20eb)

This is good, but I know that in the beginning, people might struggle to instruct ChatGPT to perform tasks directly without explanation, to teach them things, or to provide good feedback. So, I came up with **custom instructions with different modes:**

In the “How you would like ChatGPT to respond” part of the custom instructions, I added the following section to allow you to trigger different behaviors of ChatGPT:

    You have several modes to answer that I can trigger in my message with keywords: 
    
    - /assistant: Provides quick, straightforward responses without extra explanations. Ideal when I need efficiency and accuracy.
        
    - /teacher: Offers a step-by-step guide to help me learn. Provide relevant tutorials or articles online that will help me understand or learn.
        
    - /feedback: Acts as a critical reviewer, giving detailed feedback on my work. Identify areas for improvement and suggest best practices.

There’s one mode to perform the task right away when you want to save time, another mode to help you learn how to do something, and finally, a mode to get good feedback on something.

**Here’s an example of the different responses you can get**. Let’s say you’re working as a marketing strategist and want to negotiate your salary—custom instructions have been applied to simulate this scenario. Here are the results:

* Feedback: [https://chatgpt.com/share/e/7696f783-ef1e-4a6e-85c7-b9dfc070d13e](https://chatgpt.com/share/e/7696f783-ef1e-4a6e-85c7-b9dfc070d13e)

Please let me know what you think about the flowchart on how to use ChatGPT and the custom instructions with different modes. Don’t hesitate to be very critical—I want to train people as effectively as possible. **Any feedback is welcome :)**"

1f3cgoz,6,2024-08-28,How I went from 0 to B1 in 3 months and placed into my school's Advanced Tagalog sequence (skipping the elementary and intermediate sequences),u/MambaMentaIity,Tagalog,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tagalog/comments/1f3cgoz/how_i_went_from_0_to_b1_in_3_months_and_placed/,"First of all, I'm not going to say that everyone can do what I did, because I have a somewhat unique set of circumstances. However, I just want to show that it's definitely possible to go this far this quickly in Tagalog.

Okay! Here we go:

CONTEXT: I was born and raised in the Philippines until elementary school, but for different reasons I was only taught English. I also didn't care AT ALL about learning Tagalog, so whenever adults would speak Tagalog around me, I intentionally ignored them, so I didn't even grow up being able to understand Tagalog like other heritage learners. I was abjectly anti-Tagalog back then, and would literally cry when people would speak to me in Tagalog, so I learned ABSOLUTELY nothing except Filipino accents and some sounds. I also learned the words pusa, pula, and aso.

I moved to America for middle and high school, so over time I lost exposure to Filipino accents and sounds, and I certainly never tried learning the language on my own. So my foundation after high school were, again, pusa, pula, and aso. (So I didn't start from 0).

Now, a few years ago, I suddenly got a burst of motivation (I think I felt deep shame at not knowing my language out of nowhere) and bought the old version of the Learn Tagalog Fast app, and also the book *Complete Filipino (Tagalog) by Corazon Castle and Laurence McGonnell. I finished the Learn Tagalog Fast app (it only had a few lessons at the time), but then something very bad happened: while I was working through the book, I started to struggle (namely, I was having extreme difficulty with the ang vs ng pronouns, and wrapping my head around the question words), and while I was struggling, I got Breath of the Wild for my Switch. So I stopped learning Tagalog and became a Zelda fanatic for years. The stuff I learned from that book and the Learn Tagalog Fast app waned away over the years, and eventually, I was back to 0 Tagalog (except for aso, pula, and pusa, although I think I now knew the word ba from the app).

THE JOURNEY BEGINS: I returned to the Philippines three months ago to visit family, with 0 Tagalog knowledge to my name except those four words. I had just bought Tears of the Kingdom for my Switch and was ready to spend my time in the Philippines visting various places and playing Zelda back at home. But then something happened: a stranger roasted me. We met at a mall, and quickly into our conversation, this person said, ""How can you call yourself a Filipino if you don't know Tagalog?"" I couldn't just let that slide.

GOAL: Become fluent in 1 year. I knew r/languagelearning said it's impossible, and I didn't care.

CIRCUMSTANCES: I'm a student, so I had almost no obligations during the summer. I also had a PS5-sized budget, with a few extra dollars that would've went to an extra controller and a couple of games had it not been for this Tagalog-learning journey. (IMPORTANT: there is a huge tradeoff between time and money when learning a language.)

MONTH 1: I immediately walked to National Bookstore and bought Gusto Kong Mag-Filipino, Volumes 1-4 (GKMF 1-4), a Tagalog Bible, and an English-Tagalog Scientific Dictionary. In addition, I bought the current version of the Learn Tagalog Fast app, which now has about 75 lessons, and the Kindle version of Tagalog & Filipino Made Easy by Sven Biller. I also bought Drops for vocabulary building. I went home and started working through GKMF 1, Learn Tagalog Fast (about 3 lessons a day), and Biller's book. In addition, I got on Tagalog Netflix and started watching at least 1.5 to 2 hours of teleseryes every night. In addition, every morning while eating breakfast, I watched grammar lessons by Tagalog Time with Pat and Tutor of Manila. While I was lying in bed, I would do about 15 minutes or more of Drops sessions each day. I also prayed as much as I could in Tagalog by following YouTube videos (even though I understood almost nothing).

After two weeks, I had completed GKMF 1 and 2, most of Learn Tagalog Fast, and finished almost all the basic grammar portions of Tagalog Time with Pat and Tutor of Manila's video lessons. I had also mostly finished the first half of Biller's book (the first half focuses on grammar while the second half focuses on an assortment of topics and situations in life), although as I read it, I realized he was an expat (read: non-native speaker) and seemed to make some mistakes in the book. The explanations also weren't that great. But even with those mistakes, it just reinforced my foundation: within the first two weeks, by repeated exposure to Tagalog grammatical concepts from various sources, I had formed a basic foundation and could struggle to form my own sentences with adjectives, actor-focus verbs, pseudo-verbs, simple questions, adverbs, and whatnot. These sources also helped build my vocabulary, and Drops was also great for me.

In week 3, I started GKMF 3, which has object-focus verbs and a variety of intermediate-level concepts. I also finished Learn Tagalog Fast (I think), so I could slowly put together a good range of sentences. I could also understand maybe 20% of conversations -- of course, I was nowhere close to conversational, but that 20% comprehension made me feel like a superhero. The rush was great, and so it was the perfect time to get introduced to the comprehensible input philosophy, especially from Refold. Read it for yourself, but because of this, I made a Tagalog-only YouTube channel, and began watching teleseryes without english subtitles. (I would actually continue to watch a teleserye called On the Wings of Love with english subtitles until near the end of Month 2, but only because I was invested in the story and didn't want to miss anything. I made a conscious effort to listen to the Tagalog words and match them with the subtitles, though. This was helpful; I picked up short words and phrases like ""di ba?"", ""nangyari"", and ""siguro"" this way.) I also tried to do a 50/50 mix of shows and videos with and without Tagalog subtitles, so that I could practice pure listening and also listening while reading.

In week 4, I started GKMF 4, which has more intermediate/advanced-level concepts. However, I added a few more things to my daily routine. First, I started listening to Barangay Love Stories every day. I understood maybe 5 percent of what was happening, but it trained my ear to keep up with rapid-fire Tagalog. Second, I started playing Clozemaster every day, and bought the annual subscription so that I could play more than 30 times a day. Third, I bought Pimsleur and started doing 1 lesson a day so that I could practice my pronunciation and speaking (I know the CI people tell you not to practice speaking/outputting at all at such an early stage, but my goal was fluency in 1 year, so I did a hybrid of CI + outputting. I also had a strong foundation in basic grammar at this time, so I think I could do some slow ""comprehensible output"" with the various concepts that I knew.).

MONTH 2: I returned to the USA after 1 month. I completed Learn Tagalog Fast and the GKMF series, but was nowhere close to fluent, or even comfortable with the grammar. BUT NOT TO WORRY! While I was in the Philippines, I ordered a bunch of books via Amazon and eBay to my American address:

Conversational Tagalog, Teresita Ramos

Intermediate Tagalog, Teresita Ramos

Modern Tagalog, Teresita Ramos

Tagalog Structures, Teresita Ramos

Handbook of Tagalog Verbs, Teresita Ramos

Tagalog for Beginners, Joi Barrios

Intermediate Tagalog, Joi Barrios

Tagalog Stories for Language Learners, Joi Barrios

Tagalog Made Easy Level 1, Lingo Mastery

Tagalog Short Stories for Beginners, Lingo Mastery

At this point, you might be wondering just how rich I am, seeing how many books and apps and programs I was buying. But I'm not rich: I was blowing all the money I was saving up to buy a PS5 with on Tagalog resources.

Anyways, when I returned to the USA, I quickly realized that Tagalog Made Easy Level 1, Conversational Tagalog, and Tagalog for Beginners were mostly a rehash of concepts I was close to mastering, if not already mastered. So I looked at Barrios' and Ramos' intermediate books and decided to use Ramos', since according to multiple instructors, Teresita Ramos is the queen of Tagalog education (even though Barrios' stuff looks more popular on Amazon). Plus, Ramos' intermediate book is thicker, so I figured I would learn more.

Wow. What an AMAZING investment Teresita Ramos' Intermediate Tagalog was. I HIGHLY, HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommend that book. She has great explanations of both culture and grammar, and has a lengthy dialogue for every lesson (113 lessons in total!) to build your reading skills and vocabulary.

Two weeks into Month 2, I decided to buy a years' subscription to Glossika to supplement Pimsleur. (I do the listening-only mode only, and as of today, I'm at roughly 12k reps. Glossika says you'll become conversational at 25k reps. I'll say that Glossika has helped me say sentences quickly, and I have a pretty intuitive grasp of the forms of various sentences now, but I still need to think careful about what exactly I want to say, what nuance I want to convey, what vocabulary is needed, and how to inflect words. But we're past Month 3 right now, and the story is still in Month 2, so I'm getting way ahead of myself.)

I then decided to buy LearningTagalog.com's course after seeing so many rave reviews (my poor wallet...). At this point, I could fly through the first 20 lessons with ease, although lessons 21-40 contained useful intermediate concepts for me. The audio dialogues also gave me useful pronunciation practice (my only language learning experience before this was Japanese, and unlike Tagalog, pronunciation isn't important at all in Japanese for conveying meaning, which I took completely for granted).

Also, I was talking to my family exclusively in Tagalog at this time, although I was STRUGGLING. Thankfully they're patient and wait for me to find the right words and grammatical structures while I go ""uh...uh...uh..."".

Also, while Clozemaster was still decent for vocabulary practice, Drops was getting kind of useless since I had finished many of the units which taught words, and was now onto intermediate/advanced units that taught phrases. But a lot of the phrases have rather basic grammatical structures, so they didn't teach me much. In addition, one of the Drops minigames is a game where you literally write out the word/phrase, so that became a huge timesink each session when I had mostly moved onto long phrases. So I bought the Tagalog Decks app for $3 and started doing the 2k deck using the Tagalog -> English setting (after removing all the words I knew like the back of my hand). I think that's been SUPER helpful.

Lastly, I found Cinemyr Films on YouTube around this time, which has to be the FUNNIEST Tagalog YouTube channel around. It made CI way more enjoyable, although I only understood maybe 40-50% of the dialogue.

MONTH 3: I had finished Ramos' Intermediate Tagalog, so I moved onto her Modern Tagalog, which is a much shorter book. It's advertised as being for advanced learners, although a lot of the material was introduced in Intermediate Tagalog. The grammar explanations are definitely much more in-depth, though.

But I finished Modern Tagalog quickly (one week), so now I had nearly no structure except for LearningTagalog.com. Not to worry! The DLI has their own free textbook. Honestly, it looks intimidating and less well-suited for self-study than the books I was using, but free is always appreciated. I haven't worked much through it though, since I knew a lot of the concepts already.

Instead, I moved onto a daily routine of 1 Pimsleur lesson, about 150-200 Glossika reps, about 200 Clozemaster problems a day, all the reviews + 20 new words on the Tagalog 2k deck, and about 90 minutes of Tagalog YouTube + teleseryes. But probably the most important thing was Tagalog.com's Reader. I was thinking about dealing the death blow to my wallet and buying LingQ, but I found out that the Tagalog Reader does basically everything LingQ can. Importantly, it can import Wattpad novels. Before I imported Wattpad though (which has, say...more authentic Tagalog), I asked Claude AI to write novel-length stories in Tagalog (chapter-by-chapter; I bought Claude's pro subscription, so my wallet didn't get a full break) then copied and pasted them into the Tagalog Reader. Eventually, I was reading AI Tagalog novels really quickly (and I learned a lot of vocabulary and inflections in the process), so I moved onto Wattpad novels. Since they're authentic and use figures of speech and forms I hadn't seen in textbook dialogues, it was somewhat slow going, but I've been getting the hang of it as of late.

And so I basically did that every day for about two weeks until I realized that I ought to get a tutor. So I got two, and I currently meet with them multiple times a week for practice. The dynamic is great because one is more structured and uses material from the news and professional world, while the other teaches Filipino pop culture. I love having them, although my wallet doesn't; five hour-long lessons a week (combined for the two of them) costs about $50, so I might train my body to eat only one meal a day. I also use Tagalog.com's tutors.

I have to say that about three weeks into Month 3, I could understand maybe 70% of the dialogue on Cinemyr Film's videos, and I can read Wattpad novels at a rate of maybe 40-50 words a minute in Tagalog.com's Reader (not using the reader slows me down to maybe one page every HOUR since I need to stop and look words up in a dictionary). My writing was also pretty decent, as I could think about and write complex sentences with the vocabulary (and Taglish shortcuts) that I knew, but my speaking was still slow and awful, full of pauses and hesitation.

Eventually I finished Pimsleur, and substituted that time to more Glossika reps and/or tutoring sessions.

PLACING INTO ADVANCED TAGALOG CLASS: At this point, I figured that taking Filipino classes at my college might be useful for practice, so I looked at the syllabi. And as it turns out, I knew every concept in the beginner syllabi and almost all the concepts in the intermediate syllabi. So I asked to take the Advanced Tagalog placement exam, but I was a little terrified: the intermediate class syllabi say that students should be at the B1 level by the end of the year, meaning I needed to be B1 to enter Advanced Tagalog.

By the grace of God, I passed. I still can't believe it.

CONCLUSION: So here we are. I intentionally wrote everything out as a story instead of as a to-do list because, honestly, I don't know what the most effective tools were for me. I used so many tools and learned the same concepts multiple times from different sources in different settings. In fact, that's probably my best advice: expose yourself to the same concepts over and over and over again until they get burned into your brain. You want an intuitive feel for the language, after all.

Also, again, I'm a student who had money saved up for a PS5, so that's why I had so much time this summer and money to throw at language-learning.

Now, my plan is to take Advanced Tagalog, do tutoring a couple of times a week, do Glossika on my daily walks to class, listen to Barangay Love Stories while walking home, and watch Tagalog YouTube/teleseryes and read Tagalog Wattpad instead of doing the other fun things I would normally do in my free time. I was also planning on going on dates this year and getting into a relationship, but that's probably down the toilet for the next year. I'll update you if I'm fluent next year.

P.S. I also think it's poetic how Breath of the Wild ended my first attempt at learning Tagalog years ago, while Tagalog destroyed any desire I had to play Tears of the Kingdom this time around."

**10 Disadvantages of Using ChatGPT Essay Writer**

[Essay writing and completing assignments](https://www.tutorsindia.com/our-services/coursework-writing/essay-writing-services/) have become simpler tasks with the aid of advanced tools like ChatGPT. Today, many college students depend on ChatGPT for generating content and finishing their assignments. Developed by OpenAI, ChatGPT has transformed how both students and professionals approach essay writing. However, it’s important to recognize the limitations of using ChatGPT for this purpose. Understanding these limitations can help users make better-informed decisions.

https://preview.redd.it/fmeo40rh7fld1.jpg?width=472&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4bcb5ec5eae273d5b9bd4a08fee080f2f358e24a

 **Lack of Expression**:  Since ChatGPT is not a human, it cannot convey emotions or expressions in its writing. The content it generates lacks the emotional depth and engagement that human writers can provide, making it less effective at capturing readers' attention.

 

 **Lack of Originality:**  ChatGPT's primary drawback is its tendency to produce content that lacks originality. It generates text based on patterns learned from existing data, which can result in essays that, while coherent, may not offer unique insights or perspectives. For those seeking to present fresh ideas, this is a significant limitation.

 

**Limited Context Understanding:** ChatGPT struggles with understanding and interpreting complex contexts. While it performs well with straightforward prompts, it often fails with nuanced topics that require a deep grasp of the subject matter. This can lead to essays that overlook important details or misunderstand the prompt.

 

 **Risk of Plagiarism:**  Another issue with ChatGPT is the risk of [unintentional plagiarism](https://www.tutorsindia.com/our-services/editing-services/plagiarism-report/). Since it draws from a wide range of sources, the generated content might closely resemble existing material, which can be problematic for students who need to ensure their work is original and free from plagiarism.

 

 **Inconsistent Quality:** The quality of output from ChatGPT can vary. Some essays may be well-structured and insightful, while others may be disorganized and lack coherence. This inconsistency can be frustrating for users who rely on the tool for high-quality results.

 

 **Over-Reliance on AI:**  Dependence on ChatGPT can lead to an over-reliance on AI, potentially impeding the development of critical thinking and writing skills. Students may struggle with basic writing tasks without AI assistance, which can be detrimental in the long term.

 

 **Ethical Concerns:**  There are ethical issues associated with using ChatGPT for essay writing. Students might use the tool to [complete assignments](https://www.tutorsindia.com/blog/struggling-structure-assignment-writing-overcome-challenges-with-tutorsindia/) without putting in the necessary effort, which undermines the educational process and raises concerns about academic integrity.

 

 **Inadequate Citation and Referencing:**  ChatGPT often falls short in accurately citing sources or adhering to specific referencing styles. This can lead to essays that lack proper attribution, potentially causing issues with plagiarism and academic standards.

 

 **Limited Critical Analysis:**  While ChatGPT generates coherent text, it lacks the ability to perform deep critical analysis. It cannot engage in the analytical thinking required for advanced academic essays, resulting in content that may be more descriptive than analytical.

https://preview.redd.it/59jd0jni7fld1.jpg?width=396&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=69bbed843023f846b5f2ea3fa06f73436c8371bf



 **Dependence on Quality of Input:**  The quality of ChatGPT’s output depends significantly on the quality of the input it receives. If prompts are vague or poorly defined, the AI may produce irrelevant or subpar content, highlighting the need for clear and precise instructions.

|**Over-Reliance on AI**|Excessive use can hinder the development of critical thinking and writing skills.|Students may struggle with basic writing tasks without AI assistance.|Dependence on AI for completing assignments without effort from the student.|
|**Ethical Concerns**|Potential misuse for completing assignments without putting in the necessary effort.|Undermines the educational process and academic integrity.|Students using AI to bypass learning and critical thinking.|
|**Inadequate Citation and Referencing**|Struggles with accurate citation and following specific referencing styles.|Leads to essays that lack proper attribution, risking plagiarism and academic standard issues.|Incorrect or missing citations in AI-generated content.|
|**Limited Critical Analysis**|Lacks the ability to perform deep, analytical thinking required for high-level academic essays.|Results in essays that are more descriptive rather than analytical.|Essays failing to meet the analytical depth required for advanced academic work.|
|**Dependence on Quality of Input**|Output quality heavily depends on the quality of input provided.|Vague or poorly defined prompts lead to irrelevant or subpar content.|Receiving irrelevant or off-topic content due to unclear instructions.|

 

 **Conclusion:** Although ChatGPT offers numerous benefits for essay writing, it’s crucial to be aware of its limitations and drawbacks. By understanding these issues, users can utilize ChatGPT more effectively and avoid potential pitfalls. Recognizing these cons will help users make informed decisions and use AI as a complementary tool rather than a crutch.

 

In summary, while ChatGPT is a powerful tool, it has its flaws. Users must remain critical and mindful of its limitations to use it effectively and ethically. By doing so, they can maximize the benefits of AI while mitigating its drawbacks.

Hello there! 

I am a fullstack software engineer with a profound interest in - you can already guess it - generative AI. While I was on holiday with my girlfriend last summer, we had a talk about her work. She is a career and personal development coach at a major university in Europe, and we were discussing the impact that tools such as ChatGPT were having on her students. 

What started as a quick resume writer prototype, has now evolved into a full-fledged AI careers platform called [CareerDeck AI](https://www.careerdeck.ai). 

From the moment you find a job vacancy to the moment thst you sign a contract: we aim to help job seekers with the following:
- write tailored resumes for specific job vacancies (did you know that each job vacancy requires a different resume?)
- write compelling and personalized cover letters for hiring managers (formatted in a unique and personalized way)
- help with job interview preparation by providing common interview questions and questions you could ask during the interview
- teach about all aspects of job hunting, salary negotiations strategies and networking in the CareerDeck Academy
- provide career guidance 24/7 by providing a ""Chat with AI Career Coach"", which has been augmented with my girlfriend's career coaching directives 
- practice the job interview - using video and voice - with an AI that acts as a hiring manager during a mock interview (coming Q4 2024)

I have not launched yet, but I think I am about 90% finished with the platform. I am now looking for feedback from actual users and I am hoping to find this in this subreddit. 

Testing out CareerDeck AI can be done in 4 simple steps.
1. [Sign up to CareerDeck AI using LinkedIn](https://www.careerdeck.ai/auth/sign-up)
2. Import your career history from LinkedIn
3. Find and add a job listing and add it to the interactive dashboard.
4. When the AI assistant is ready, you'll receive a tailored resume and cover letter. Use the editors to make changes and choose themes. Download the content as PDF!

As a token of appreciation, you'll get 10 free credits when you get started. This will give you 10 resumes, 10 cover letters and 10 preparation plans for 10 job listings.

Let me know what you think in the comments! Your feedback is of immense value to me.

Please note the following:
- CareerDeck AI is optimized for use on tablets and laptops. Mobile support is a bit flaky as of now
- Things can and will break. I don't expect any showstoppers, but rather minor things in the UI
- The landing page and feature pages are not complete, I am still finalizing content, but they should give you a good overall impression "

Is anyone aware of any work on neural scaling laws in terms of the number of parameters of the student model? Or, bonus points, in terms of both the student and teacher model size?

Also I'm sort of curious if people have managed to distill one of these general purpose big models like Llama into a smaller version (in my past experience, usually distillation is just focused on a small subset of problems, not the entire universe of problems)."

For reference, I am a transferee from UST CE to FEU-Tech BS IT nung 3rd Term of SY:2022-2023 (April 2023). I completed 6/8 semesters sa UST.

Currently, I am 3rd Year BS IT-BA student and on my Thesis era. 👨🏻‍💻


Tip #1: Switch to Irregular Status

- Believe it or not, mas okay ang irregular status sa FEU Tech.

Basically, sa college Irreg ≠ Bobo. Irreg just means you’re not following the curriculum either may inunderload, overload, nag-advance take, shifter, transferee w/ credited subjects, or baka nga may binagsak nga talga.

So don’t judge irregular students. Actually, almost lahat irregular sa FEU Tech. So lalawak ‘yung pananaw niyo na hindi lahat ng irregular students ay bobo. Pero syempre meron rin talagang patapon.

Wala akong nakikitang advantage ang regular students (bukod sa mauuna lang sila sa enrollment) over irreg. Hindi rin optimized ‘yung Curriculum ng FEU Tech that’s why binabago nila ito yearly.

When I say binabago, jinujumble jumble nila ‘yung arrangement ng subjects.

Kunyari, HCI 2 is offered sa Curriculum 2021 on their 3rd Year - 3rd Term. Sa Curriculum 2022, on their 2nd Year - 1st Term. Sa Curriculum 2023, on their 2nd Year - 3rd Term.

Marami pa ‘yan. Marami pang subjects ang in-experiment ng FEU Tech.

Kung ganyan lang rin pala. You might as well choose your own subjects nalang per term. In that way, you’ll have control over your learning experience. You can jumble all your GEDs and other non-thesis-related subjects and it will not delay you. 

PERO you’ll have to STRICTLY NEED TO TAKE THE PRIORITY SUBJECTS per term para on-track ka pa rin with your batchmates. Priority subjects are Specialization and Thesis-Related Subjects.

Another advantage rin ng Irreg is since hindi ka block section, pwede ka mamili ng kahit anong section. You have freedom to customize your schedule and avoid profs na ayaw mo. Regulars can’t do this unless late enrollee sila. Regulars are strictly block section and don’t have freedom to customize their schedule. Malas mo ‘pag panget natapat na schedule at prof sa’yo.

Also, kapag irregular ka mapaparami mo connections mo sa higher batch. You can befriend them. You can ask them advice about your future subjects. This is what I did. Kaya alam ko na agad i-eexpect ko sa lahat ng subjects sa IT curriculum. Kaya it’s easier for me to plan out my subjects until graduation. My higher batchmates helped me rin in do’s and don’ts sa thesis which is super helpful.




Tip #2: Know the grading system

- 70% is the passing grade dito, which is high. In comparison, sa UST ay 60% lang, minsan pa nga binababa depende sa bumagsak. 

Ang napansin ko rito, hindi nila binababa ‘yung passing grade. Rather, inaaddjust lang nila ‘yung kung anong grades meron ka. So kung inadjust na tapos hindi talaga umabot sa 70%, bagsak ka na talaga.

Sa 1st and 2nd Year, puro 70% Lec and 30% Lab ang grading system.

This could make or break your grades. Ibig sabihin lang niyan. Mas importante ‘yung exams over lab output. Kaya medyo useless kahit sobrang galing mo sa lab kung mababa ka sa mga exams mo, malabo ka maka-3.0+.

Mawawala yang 70-30 na yan sa 3rd year.

Focus on perfecting your Summative Assessments and Final Exam kasi yan ang bubuhat ng grades mo. Midterm Exam are just small fraction of grade.

In my opinion, 2.5 is like the average grade for all majors (except sa Thesis). Sa 1st year ay madadali lang yan so if kaya niyo maka-4.0, gawin niyo na kasi you’ll rarely get 4.0 starting 2nd year.

For GEDs, 3.0 is like the average grade. Super dali lang ng GEDs. Please if kaya naman i-4.0, go for it. This will bring your GWA up.

1st Year usually kaya maging Top Performing Student pero starting 2nd Year, malabo maachieve yang 3.4 GWA due to the unoptimized Curriculum ng BSIT. Puro madadali kasi subjects sa 1st Year. Kaya lahat ng mahirap napunta sa 2nd Year to 4th Year. Kaya in relation sa Tip #1, mag-irreg kayo para mabalance niyo yung madali at mahirap na subject. Hindi maganda pag madali lahat or mahirap lahat. Ideally, 18 units per term dapat, 3 mahirap at 3 madaling subject. Para balanced difficulty.



Tip #3: Know that college profs will only teach the basics/fundamentals

- In college talaga, basics and fundamentals lang tinuturo. Kaya wag kayo mabigla na parang ang basic lang ng turo ng profs kasi ganun talaga sa college.

As coming from UST, I had the same experience pero mas marami nga lang ‘yung mga prof na nag-gogo beyond the fundamentals.

In relation to Tip #1, lumipat ka sa section na may magaling na prof. 

In my observation, ang alam ko is may faculty shortage talaga sa FEU Tech kaya madalas paulit-ulit ‘yung magiging prof mo throughout your college years.

You’ll encounter profs teaching ‘yung mga subjects na hindi naman nila forte. So ang ending, eme emeng turo lang gagawin.


Tip #4: Find competent groupmates / grade conscious friends

- Puro group activity kayo rito in both GEDs and major kaya avoid freeloaders. If 1st Year or 2nd Year ka dapat you test the waters na kung sino pwede mo maka-grupo sa thesis kasi 1 year mo sila makakasama from System Analysis to Capstone 2. Dapat magka-section kayo.

Another info lang rin, maraming freeloaders sa FEU Tech so please don’t become one. Anlala kasi talaga.


Tip #5: Try niyo seryosohin pag-aaral niyo

- Dami kong na-encounter sa 1 year kong stay sa FEU Tech na umaangat ng year level pero as in wala talagang talent kahit saan sa different field ng IT. 

Sorry kung ang sama kong tao ha. Pero grabe kasi talaga. Hindi mo maasahan sa Programming, Networking, Design, Communication Skills, Leadership, Writing. Tangina, nag-enroll ka pa????

Paano puro pangongopya at ChatGPT lang ginawa kaya ang ending, mediocre.

Please study para mas maging confident kayo sa mga Final Projects at may maiambag kayo sa group activity. Hindi puro pa-cute nalang.

Also leverage ChatGPT to learn not directly kokopyahin ‘yung unang results. Dami kong naencounter na ganito sa lower batch. To the point na ako na gumawa ng part nila kasi halatang ChatGPT.

Saka pwede niyo ring gawin pang-portfolio ‘yung mga Final Projects niyo kaya if kaya naman gandahan, gandahan niyo. Ganito ginagawa ko in building my Front End Portfolio and Analytics and BI Portfolio. 



Tip #6: Try doing volunteer internship or joining orgs

- Hindi sa pang-aano ha. Pero in my opinion, as coming from UST, panget ang org culture dito sa FEU Tech. I just don’t see anything na worthy ilagay sa resume or parang mabuibuild skills mo or if you’re into student leadership. Sadly, mas focus lang talaga ang orgs dito sa events management (na sila-sila rin nag bebenefit instead of student body) rather than addressing student concerns.

Pero you can try naman and see it yourself. Again, that is my opinion lang. Napangitan ako sa sistema. 

Instead, I suggest you can try doing side projects nalang to build portfolio, or take online courses sa Coursera and Udemy to get Certifications so that you can use it to land a voluntary internship.

Internships >>>>> Orgs

As a working student rin, I started doing internships early in my UST days. I learned so much when I worked with different companies. I had 3 internships from 2021 to 2023. Mas may bearing ang internship kasi you are working with legit companies unlike orgs. Most HRs count internships as work experience for fresh grads. Plus points sa kanila if they saw your resume na you did many internship. This means dedicated ka talaga for learning and improving your skills. Please note that ORGS ARE NOT WORK EXPERIENCE. Work experience refers to OJT/internship, full time, part time, contractual, freelance work only. Have a separate section (Organization) in your resume for your school orgs (if you have affiliations)


In relation to Tip #3, you’ll learn so much when you try to explore outside university. Fundamentals lang kasi talaga sa college. Saka sa internship talaga magkakaalaman kung may natutunan ka sa college kasi dito maapply mga tinuturo ng prof mo.

If gusto mo maging Web Developer, apply for Web Development Internship ganun.

Saka some companies offer salary for interns.




Tip #7: Think of Feasible Thesis/Capstone topics

The earlier the better. Commonly ring binabagsak ng students dito ‘yung Thesis kasi masyadong mahirap yung topic, maraming kulang sa system, walang client sa IT Project Management.

Emphasis sa “feasible”. ‘Yung kayang gawin ng isang college student lang ha. At kaya ng budget. Mahirap ‘pag masyadong complex kasi 3 months lang each ‘yung per part ng Thesis. Oras ang kalaban niyo.




Moment of truth: “Maganda po ba mag-aral sa FEU Tech?”

- Honestly, parang medyo lang. Mga 6.5-7/10 

Masyadong mahal dito. I was surprised na I had Php 84,000 tuition fee last term. Compared sa UST, Php 60,000 liner lang. Masyadong mahal lab fee, minsan ‘di rin namin nagagamit sa totoo lang. 

Teaching-wise, mas maraming eme-emeng prof kaysa magaling. Also, puro mga freeloaders dito. Bilang lang talaga ‘yung student na passionate for excellence. Mostly memapasa lang tapos magrereklamo bakit mababa kahit na pala-absent naman, binagsak exam ganun. 

Pero I like ‘yung curriculum ng IT dito kasi may specialization. Unlike in other univs nasa below 180 lang sila usually kasi general IT curriculum sila. Dito kasi 204 units due to specialization. You’re not just graduating with IT knowledge, may expertise ka pa sa isang field (BA, WMA, CST, AGD). Sa ibang univ kasi Elective lang inoffer, not an actual Major or Specialization. ‘Yun ang upperhand ni FEU Tech.

As coming from UST, my realization rin is wala talagang perfect learning institution. Even sa Big 4 dami ring issues. Kanya-kanyang disadvantage at advantage lang talaga."

I don't know. I know how to write and read/understand code. But one factor that really makes me doubt my skills is that there has never been a time I did not use ChatGPT for school projects.

The use case I'd like to use ChatGPT in is teaching. Specifically, I wish to upload the contents of a coursebook to a GPT or integrate it somehow within a different page using the API. I have zero programming skills but I work for a university and if I can find a way to integrate the book to ChatGPT, my students will be more than happy as they will be able to practice using the application.

I want to buy ChatGPT plus to my students and share the GPT with them so that they can ask extra questions and do additional exercises with the AI instead of forcing them to spend their time on crappy testing or reading platforms.

I have access to a small team of developers and IT, and expertise in my field. Combining these skills, what do you think would be the best path? I don't know if it's feasible or maybe i should be seeking other LLMs in the first place. Help would be much appreciated."
1f3zq98,2,2024-08-29,5 back-to-school AI tools to boost learning and productivity,u/private_witcher,hacksguider,https://www.reddit.com/r/hacksguider/comments/1f3zq98/5_backtoschool_ai_tools_to_boost_learning_and/,"**Boost Your Back-to-School Experience with These 5 AI Tools**

As the school year approaches, students and educators alike are seeking innovative ways to enhance learning and productivity. Embracing technology, especially artificial intelligence, can significantly streamline the educational process. Here are five AI tools that can help students maximize their potential this academic year.

First up is **ChatGPT**, an AI-driven language model that can assist students with everything from brainstorming ideas for essays to providing explanations for complex subjects. Its conversational nature allows for a more interactive learning experience, making it a valuable resource for tackling tough homework questions.

Next, consider using **Grammarly**. This tool goes beyond simple spell-checking; it offers real-time grammar suggestions, style improvements, and clarity enhancements. Whether you're drafting an essay or writing an email to a professor, Grammarly can help ensure your writing is polished and professional.

For those who struggle with time management, **Todoist** is an excellent AI-powered task manager. It helps students organize their assignments, set deadlines, and prioritize tasks, allowing for a more efficient study schedule. By visualizing tasks, students can avoid last-minute cramming and manage their time effectively.

Another noteworthy tool is **Khan Academy**, which utilizes AI to provide personalized learning experiences. It offers a wealth of resources across various subjects and adapts to the learner's pace, making it perfect for students who need extra help or want to explore new topics.

Finally, don’t overlook **Notion**. This all-in-one workspace allows students to take notes, manage projects, and collaborate with classmates seamlessly. Its versatility makes it a favorite among students who appreciate having everything in one place.

In my opinion, incorporating these AI tools into your study routine can make a significant difference. They not only save time but also enhance the learning experience, allowing students to focus on what truly matters—understanding and mastering their subjects. As we gear up for another school year, leveraging these technologies can set you on the path to academic success."
1f40o0z,8,2024-08-29,BSCS SE/AI/DS - Tips ,u/Lanzero25,feumanila,https://www.reddit.com/r/feumanila/comments/1f40o0z/bscs_seaids_tips/,"Hi Chat, saw the BS IT Tips post, and that was pretty good. So I am going to piggyback off that and made one for all my fellow Com Sci students outs there. I am a 3rd year CS student specializing in Data Science, and although may AI, SE, and DS, our curriculums do not differ until 2nd Year 3rd Term, so we have a lot of subjects in common. As such, this is a guide for CS in general.

**TIP 1 - Join Events**

As a CS student, there are two student organizations that you can look into, whether you want to join or become an officer.

* Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)
* Junior Philippine Computing Society (JPCS)

These are student organizations that you can join to gain incentives, whether it be on exams or additional grades. These events usually comprise seminars and competitions. 

If your professor is offering incentives, attend if possible especially if your professors are the advisers of these orgs (Sir Jennefer Sabonsolin for ACM and Sir Alec Sison (Unsure for this one) for JPCS).

There are also other orgs that profs might give incentives to such as ASTI, but incentives are rarely offered for CS there. To sum up this point, take all the extra points you can.

**TIP 2 - Get Ready For Math**

If math is not your strong suit, get ready for it. This goes for any years of CS because math is all around the curriculum.

* 1st years have MMW, Anal Geom, Math Analysis, and Stats.
* 2nd years have Physics 1 and 2, Linear Algebra, Discrete Math 1 and 2, and Automata Theory.
* 3rd years have Modeling and Simulation, and Math Methods.

CS is a very math-heavy program even if the math isn't something you'd see from Engineering. It is also very theoretical which means you would have to focus on logic when it comes to programming.

To all the freshies out there, be weary when you reach 2nd term and hit Anal Geom, a lot of students in my batch became irregular after failing it. This is also to the 2nd years out there, be careful for Linear Algebra this term. The math department only has 2 profs for Linear Algebra that are good, but this subject almost broke me so be weary of it.

**TIP 3 - Programming Languages**

* For 1st years, get ready to be sick of C++ because it's what you'll be using for the entire year. 
* When you reach the 2nd year, you'll be bombarded with new languages, Java, SQL, Assembly, and Python. You also get to learn PHP, which will make you use HTML and CSS, something that won't be taught and expected to know already.
* 3rd years will have extras such as Matlab and Kotlin, but there's not much as what you get in your 2nd year.

The entire 1st year will teach you the C++ syntax, but what's important is you understand the logic, because this will help you understand other languages easily. So as early as this year, be sure you don't leave year 1 not knowing how looping works.

**TIP 4 - Exam Meta**

Exams are usually held on Canvas, some subjects like the math subjects, are done on paper. Use the knowledge of the former to your advantage.

Take advantage of formative assessments (FA) in Canvas. FAs are mini-exams that quiz you on the content of the modules and are NOT GRADED. They also have multiple attempts. Most of the time (Emphasis on most), the questions are directly ripped from the modules themselves. Like the question is copied, a specific word is removed and you have to pick from the choices what is the answer.

The trick here is that the content of the Summative Assessments and Midterm Exams come from FAs, which means that some of the exams are directly ripped from modules themselves. 

Now, for Final Exams, they are departmental. To those who don't know, one professor makes the exam for one subject. Some profs just take the questions out of the FAs and SAs, directly ripping them out of the module, and some profs make their own questions.

* Departmental Final Exams happen during finals week, where the only classes happening are the exams themselves. All exams of the same subject happen at the same time period of 2 hours. CS exams are 100 points, the GED exams are usually around 50 but can vary depending on prof.

Maraming profs ang mahirap magbigay, and some just rip it straight from Canvas. So just don’t memorize the modules because if you don’t understand the topic, you’ll be at risk with the profs who make their own exams. Two examples of this happened, one happened during my 2nd year in Algorithms, where the exam took all of us out by the end of it, it was by far the hardest exam I’ve taken and I think I didn’t even pass that exam. This was also the exact case in Data Structures and Algorithms, last term. What I really mean here is that if your profs didn’t teach you well enough, you will be in a difficult situation when the professor that made the exam is notorious for making difficult exams. 

**TIP 5 - Canvas Quizloader and Formatives**

Marami pa di nakakaalam nito, but Canvas Quizloader is an extension that tracks your previous FA attempts and when you retake the FA and encounter the same question, it will indicate whether your answer to that question is right or wrong. This is helpful because you won’t really know what questions are right after submitting the FA, so this helps in understanding the modules more.

* I also want to add, if you want, keep track of formative assessments by creating spreadsheets or flashcards. This helps in reviewing talaga.

**TIP 6 - Prepare Early and Review Early.**

This is mostly for 2nd years and above, but this also applies to freshies. Take it from our block as an example. We never crammed as hard in exams, usually didn't pull all nighters when finals period came.

It all changed when the 2nd year hit us like a truck. All-nighters became a normal part of my life whenever midterms of finals week arrived. So when these exams come, don't prepare when they're near. Instead, study and don't waste your precious time. You wouldn't want to regret not studying when the finals schedule released and you have 3 exams in a day, trust me, it is not fun.

This idea also applies to projects. If you don’t cram projects, you’ll be having more free time than you used to. This is especially true for incoming 2nd Year students. The amount of projects that the 2nd Year 1st Term has is something I never want to come back to.

**TIP 7 - Org-Academic Balance**

To preface, medyo general tip na rin to, but please don't join an org for the sake of joining an org. Member, sure, but becoming a Junior Officer/Officer of an org has its responsibilities.

If you join an org, make sure you can balance the tasks with your studies.  It sounds nice on paper but not when you can't focus on acads. This really becomes a big problem when you have an event to help organize, and an exam soon.

To the students reading. If you want to explore org stuff, the booths in 2nd, 5th, and 6th floor will be there for the 1st week of classes.

**Tip 8 - Professors!**

This is an opinionated tip so don’t take it as fact. These are just observations I’ve had and the opinions of my schoolmates. I will be focusing on CS profs as they are who you'll see most of the time:

* **Doc Angelo Arguson** - 7/10. Call him doc, he's pretty chill. He's semi-notorious for being nice to freshmen and not as nice to higher levels, usually because you should already know the process so you shouldn't have any problems.
* **Ma'am May San Pablo** - 6/10. She's very nice, she's also sweet, and easy to approach. The problem is how you'll approach, sometimes matagal bago magreply after mo magreach out. She's also neat when it comes to teaching. But I wouldn't recommend her for programming subjects. As for her, siya din ang lalapitan mo if you have issues in COR and such.
* **Sir Reginald Cheng** - 8/10. One of the better explainers out there. He explains the topics well but the downside is mataas ang chance mo na makatulog sa classes niya. This may also be a problem because for me, he is a bit slower kaya di agad natatapos mga lessons. But an upside from this is siya na bahala if ung content ng final exam is di niya naturo.
* **Ma’am Fanny Almeniana** - 9/10. She’s also a great professor and teaches the syllabus pretty well, there really isn’t a downside to her so if she becomes your professor, just don’t be noisy in class.
* **Sir Abraham Magpantay** - 8/10. Solid prof, you’ll be in safe hands kay sir. He’s generous when it comes to incentives and he’s also lenient.
* **Sir Anthony Aquino** - 9/10. Great explainer, easy to approach, and very diligent. Magaling siya magturo pero mahirap din ung exams niya, pero not as hard as the one next.
* **Doc Hadji Tejuco** - 8/10 magturo, 1/10 magpaexam. 6/10 sa grades. Start nako dun sa teaching. Doc is great at teaching, same tier or even higher than Sir Cheng to me. He explains the topics well and he’s very advanced to the point na mas nadedeepen ung knowledge mo sa topic kahit na surface level lang. But ang downside nito is mahirap ang exams niya. Exams are a lot more focused on memorization which sucks plus fill in the blanks. However, kahit na sa tingin mo bagsak grade mo dahil bagsak exams mo, he actually curves hard. He was also the one who made both Algorithms and Data Structures exams I mentioned in Tip 4.
* **Sir Jennefer Sabonsolin** - 7/10. He’s okay as a professor and a mentor, mabait din si sir, kaso ung nagiging downside lang talaga ng karamihan is ung accent niya I swear.
* **Sir Justine Pura** - 10/10. Aside from being a great professor, he also graduated from FEU Tech, kaya mas understanding siya sa students, kaya if naging prof mo si sir, swerte ka na agad.

Other professors I haven’t mentioned are those that I haven’t gotten yet:

* Sir Alec Sison - Prof ko siya this term so wala pako masasabi right now. But he’s also a fresh grad of FEU Tech, so I’m inclined to believe that he’s also understanding.
* Ma’am Elisa Malasaga - I’ve heard a lot of great things about her so she’s one of the profs na pag nakuha mo, swerte ka.
* Ma’am Beau Habal - From what I heard din she’s also a solid prof.

The other profs I didn’t mention are mostly part-timers, so I can’t really say much about them.

**TIP 9 - The Main Goal is Understanding**

This is the most important part. No matter how good you are at memorizing the content, or getting a high score on exams, all of it is in vain if you don’t understand the topic. You can use ChatGPT but that doesn’t automatically mean you know the topic. Also, don’t disregard ChatGPT, Com Sci people made ChatGPT, use it but don’t abuse it. You may also ask your seniors for learning material so you can advance study.

A high grade is great and all, even better if you break into Top Performing Student, but that’s not going to be as important in the long run as developing the skills necessary to become a great programmer. What will set you apart from others is if you understand the topic and know what you’re doing.

**TIP 10 - For The Freshies**

Don’t be pressured immediately. You may not have experience in programming but neither did I nor most of my batchmates. And if you’re still unsure about Com Sci, you may want to stick around and see, maybe this is where you belong after all. Take it from me, I wanted to become an engineer, but I arrived at Com Sci and here I am, still alive. If after a year or so, and CS is still not your thing, don’t feel bad about shifting.

That is all for this post. Goodluck to all of you fellow CS students, hoping you will all excel! Feel free to ask if I left some stuff out or some points were vague."

I never feel like I'm at anyone's level. I have a friend who has been in the industry and tells me I'm doing great and I should apply for internships (which I am), but I talk to my peers and honestly feel like an idiot. 

  
I practice here and there on leetcode, I do my work, I don't rely on chatgpt at all. I like to stay up to date with tech info like data leaks and can do basic troubleshooting. Have messed around with more languages. But I see people making their own custom arch distro? I don't really understand how to fully use github. I just learned what the term CRUD means. I don't understand why some prefer some IDEs to others (we have to use eclipse this semester and students are frustrated but I didn't get why). Others have used Rust and stuff, etc. You know what I mean?   

  
Like I can go through line after line of my bugs and look into it..See whats the problem and find solutions. I know how to condense my code the best I can whereas others may use a bunch of if-else statements. Then we have to download something for a class and someone goes ""oh god a webkit2gtk"" and I'm like, what does that mean?? and I have to look into it.   

It's like a huge give and take, I may know some things more but the things I know are not anything special compared to what other students seem to be doing. And it isn't the end because I can easily learn all this stuff, which I try to do. But it feels neverending and I'm always behind. I haven't been practicing as much this year because I dedicated time to networking after seeing the mass layoffs going on, and that's paying off. But what happens if I land a job and I just feel like an idiot still? For one of the companies I wanna work for I saw what they expect or want their software engineers to know and I could faint. I didn't recognize anything."

Back when I was in SHS I started learning programming and other IT stuff since ine-extend kona knowledge ko to prepare for college kase passionate talaga ako sa IT to the point na kahit virtualization and cloud computing in-overview ko na para magkaroon lang ako ng general knowledge sa mga topics na yon. 

Eventually lumawak ng lumawak background ko sa programming and development and I've been building several projects using the programming languages I've learned. I even create some projects that utilizes hardware prototypes like Arduino for IoT projects.

Nag-start na den ako ma-seen sa klase as ""the chosen one"" ng mga classmates ko kase nga marami na raw akong ""alam"" sa mga ibang IT topics where in reality I'm fully aware na sobrang layo kopa. Alam kong nasa ibabaw palang ako ng iceberg.

I'm always trying my best both in personal and academic projects pero lately netong 2024 nag-start akong kalawangin due to me solely using AI tools on the projects na ginagawa ko, ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot and even Blackbox or coding assistants like Codeium. I became lazy writing some code within my own and started relying on autocompletes of AI in code. Halos buong bakasyon ko lahat ng projects na nagawa ko may tulong ng AI and dko namalayang pati skills ko nawawala na. Hindi nako nagpa-practice ng kahit ano puro nood nalang ako tas basa tas pag magcocode c AI na bahala. 

Reality hits hard nung nagstart na ulet pasukan this semester. Nagpa-recap ng mga inaral namen nung first year like programming fundamentals and Java ung prof namen sa DSA. Pinagawa kame ng flowchart sa papel to which I struggled lightly. 

Sumunod non pinag-practical kame, nabadtrip ung prof namen samen kaya pinarusahan kame pinag-debugging kame ng code sa Java para sa simple grading program within 2 mins only. Yung mga classmates ko expected na maso-solve ko agad ung problem since karamihan sa kanila di nila na-solve. Unfortunately, I fucked up really hard this time na-pressure ako sa time limit and hirap na hirap akong hanapin ung mali sa code within 2 minutes kaya out of 4 syntax errors, 2 ung na-managed kong i-solve. I was so disappointed on myself na para bang dko na kilala sarili ko. Tinanong kopa sarili ko kung ako ba talaga toh kase ung dating kayang kaya mag-solve ng machine problem within 5 minutes hirap na hirap i-resolve ung errors sa code na almost 22 lines lang naman.

Nagmuka akong gago kase kung kelan tapos na ung time ko tsaka ko lang na-realize pano i-resolve ung errors. Pag-uwi ko ng bahay ni hinde ko mabuksan laptop ko para mag-code, inis na inis ako sa katangahan at kabobohan ko, grabe ung sisi kase graded ung practical na yon, humilata nalang ako sa higaan ko thinking na baka sguro nawala na passion ko sa programming sa sobrang katamaran ko.

And yesterday i was annoyed by it and i ranted to chatgpt and it told me that i probably have a phobia for them. And then i went and read up on an article about what a phobia is, and it seems to fit really well with what i experience 

When i was younger, a mosquito bit me and i killed it while it was on my leg and it was huge, and after that i stayed inside the entire summer vacation except for three days, and i refused to open my window for any long period of time where i wasn’t intently watching it. 
As the years have gone, it’s gotten better, and i never avoid going outside to avoid the bugs anymore, but the changes of seasons always hits me extremely hard, and i hate when it’s anything less than winter outside because i just dread when the bugs come to life again. 

Ironically, the only bug i don’t have this problem with is spiders. My friend told me once “just imagine it’s walking away from you” and it made me no li bc er afraid of spiders, and it helped it even more than what was said because now i spider can be walking towards me and i won’t care. I do get normal-scared when trying to take them out of the house, but like i’m scared it’ll fall out of the cup or it’ll die, so it’s like rational. If they scare me it’s because it’s a jumpscare and not because it’s the same response i get to any other bugs. 

Bugs that can fly are the worst, because they’re unpredictable. I can’t stand them getting in my space and it makes me nervous and anxious and on edge to the point where any movement on my body is picked up as a possible danger. So, when i’m in that heightened state, there’s a lot of rash movements, and bodily reactions i just can’t control. I read up on adrenaline yesterday too, it’s definitely just that my body pumps up adrenaline when i see a bug because i detect it as a major threat, even though i rationally know it can’t hurt me in any major way. 

Actually a bug Just flew by outside my window just now, so i can live journal how my body reacts. I get a pang feeling of something shifting, it feels exactly like how a jumpscare does, but my heart beats faster, i start to be very attentive to my surroundings, i feel very alert and even though i know very well that my hair moving one millimeter isn’t actually a threat or even anything, i still HAVE to whack it? Or put my hand near the area because if it WAS a but, it could be biting me or something, and i would pay for it later on. 

There are many situations like this one where the bug isn’t even in my space, i just heard it, and i logically know there is none around, but by body’s response will not stop and i will feel paranoid, and see the little floaties in my eyes in my peripheral vision and believe i’m seeing an insect. Right now the reaction is practically gone, which is very nice. But like my throat gets dry, my body start to tremble. Sometimes i’ll get so overwhelmed i have to cry and cover myself fully with a blanket or something. It’s mostly just very annoying. I’m not in danger. That’s a fruitfly. Yk?

Chatgpt suggested exposure therapy, but that doesn’t really feel right to me. Living life is literally exposure therapy. There are bugs everywhere. 
I don’t have this reaction every single time. But a lot of times. It usually happens at least twice a week. But now it’s late summer and so this week i’ve had this reaction for at least 3 days in a row, while in mid spring i’ll maybe have it once on a monday and once on a friday, to lesser degrees than i do at this time. The degree of the “episodes” can vary very much. But it is a constant in my life, and has been for about 7 years maybe. I obviously want it gone, but i don’t believe that is possible. I’ve learnt to live with it, and not hide from it as i did in the start. 

—————————
As i’ve mentioned. I also get like this around cats. I’ve had negative experiences with them in my past. 

When i was around 14 my mom’s friend reached out and said they found a litter of kittens, and that if we didn’t take them, they would get shot. My brother was excited and my mother caved and was excited too, and i begged her to say no, but she said yes. 

This lead to me being slightly less afraid of cats. I can do cats if they’re controlled by the owners, and they don’t try to play with me or have me pet them. Cats are very cute, i don’t hate them at all, but a lot of people try to argue when i say i’m irrationally afraid (which is what i’ve been saying to try to describe what chatgpt told me yesterday was a phobia) of cats. 

My mon still has the cats, i moved to my grandparents 1,5 years ago. It immediately lifted sisyphus’s boulder off my shoulders. I lived with those cats for at least 3 years. I’m still afraid of cats, and i’m still afraid of them. And i feel crazy amounts of guilt and pain about how i had to treat those cats because of my phobia. It literally makes me cry thinking about it. I loved them, but because of my phobia, i couldn’t give them any of the love and bonding they needed, and had to load that off on my mom and brother.

They wouldn’t be allowed to go into my room, which they always wanted to, and if i accidentally left the door to my room open after going to school, i’d often come home and find one of them sleeping in my bed. To which i would sit on the couch and cry. At some point the cats figured out they could jump in through my window if the door wasn’t open and i hated it, because then i would have to go open the bedroom door for them, but sometimes they would rub up against my leg and i would start freaking out. 

I did manage to pet them, but only as long as they didn’t step on my or but their paws on any part if my body, because them the adrenaline would kick in, and i would run out of the room, and feel the way i explained earlier, with no clue why, what to do, or how to calm down the reaction. Multiple times i have felt that way for up to three hours afterwards. I was always afraid of feeding them. I would, but i would be extremely uncomfortable the whole way through, because seeing their teeth scared me immensely. I could pick them up also, but only in aways where they couldn’t touch me, and i was also very often very afraid of them having acquired ticks in their fur. 

After a while i would let them come to my bed if they wanted me to pet them. And then at any time they would try to get playful, or try to climb on my or make cookies, i would get hit with a pang of adrenaline and they would notice that reaction and leave, or i would run away. It depended. 

I got used to them, and i was happy ish living with them, but when i  left that situation, i realized how much of an actual toll that had on me. When we first got them, they were as afraid of us, as we were of them, and at some point both of then tried to seek shelter in my room or under my bed, and it would feel so bad. 

Also psychologically, it was not doing me any favors. I would get really upset about my reactions and my limitations with them, and i would cry about it, or think about it so much. And i would just always apologize to them, cause not only was i like panicking about them getting near me, i also felt so guilt that i couldn’t let them get near me. That’s the point of a pet. 

All that goes to say: they did in some ways help me with my fear of cats, especially seen from the outside. But it definitely left me with a lot more psychological baggage and emotional scars than it was worth. And my cats were extremely well behaved as well, and even picked up on my boundaries. And i think they liked me a lot because i didn’t push theirs. Even though i loved them, i could never make them feel loved in the way that i thought that they should. 

And that is a lot more emotional than the bug thing, but to me that (and existence as a whole really) kinda proves that exposure therapy probably won’t work for me. I Think i lived with those cats 4 years. And now i can be in the same room, and heck, even the same couch as a cat. Big progress. But if there’s a cat. I will still sit as far away from it as possible, if it touches me, i will still freak out, and if i’m at a sleepover and the cat needs to be able to pass through the room, i will never be chill about that. I will feel like alarms are blaring through my body and that i’m in danger and i can’t sleep. 

I totally get why most people actively avoid their phobias, because it is not good to have fight or flight reactions this often. I’m pretty sure of that. 

I do have a fucked up nervous system anyways, as i’m autistic. But that presents itself indifferent ways, which actually kinda means that my nervous system isn’t only dysregulated, but also overloaded and overworked bc of the fight or flight and the frequency of them. I feel bad for my nervous system, the guy deserves a break. 

————————— 
Now you’ve heard my experience (i just needed an excuse to rant about it and explain it) 
Learning about what a phobia actually is, though, really helped me feel more normal. I’ve never known how to describe it to people, and people always respond to me with “that isn’t dangerous” as if that is going to help. They probably mean good, but i don’t think the ladybug and the butterfly are planning on collabing to kill me with a sword. My body just will not stop sending in adrenaline troops to aid me in battle (sitting on the bus when theres a wasp inside). I think my reactions last a lot longer than is normal. 

The website i read detailed it as being different for different people and being anxiety directed at a specific thing or phenomenon. And some people experience it to a degree where they just avoid it, and their lives aren’t affected. Some experience that it keeps them from leaving their houses or subjecting themselves to certain situations where their phobia might get triggered. 

I very rarely experience any anticipation-anxiety for these things anymore. I do every now and then if i know it’s likely and i’m in a situation where i have less control than usual. Also, i don’t really actively avoid bug anymore, because that is impossible. But, i do have some really good strategies that make me feel safe. And i think very “my room shall be safe, so i have somewhere to draw back within” and i think that’s really nice. 

For example, i not linger keep my window closed, i rather have a curtain that i can pull down that they can’t get through if i pull it down and it cover the whole window frame. So then there can be a wasp/fly flying around between that and the window without me having to leave the room, because i know it can’t get to me inside. It’s been pretty revolutionary for me. 

What works best for me is control-strategies, that can put in situations where i avoid the fear kicking in in the first place because i can force the thing i fear to stay out of my space. 

Having people around me who understand and know of my issue and can eliminate the threat is probably the best thing ever. If i’m at a hang out and i can find one person i can ask to just kill all the bugs that get into the room, even though the bugs get in, i feel much safer and can have an assumption that i can’t get hurt because i am protected. 

Maybe people will have more of an understanding of my experience if i do use the word phobia, now that i know it’s very likely to be  that. (Tell me in the comments if it’s a phobia😉) 
People always act very sympathetic to other people i’ve heard having phobias, and take steps accordingly, and maybe avoid the subject or stuff like that. 

—————————

It doesn’t always feel like it, but i am actually doing pretty good at handling it. 

The one problem that is truly a problem with the whole thing is the reaction i get. That, when i’ve first started the process, it’s hard to calm down from. And, when it’s started, it’s much easier for it to continue at the smallest little thing. That’s how the human instincts, nervous system, and the adrenaline process works. 

The adrenaline sets you on high alert, heightened senses, heart beats faster, numbs your feeling of pain, increases your focus and your strength. 

Heightened senses are there to help out with getting the threat in your sights, and also realize immediately its proximity to you. It’s survival instinct mode. 
But then when the threat is only perceived, and is not actually life-threatening, that means the body is overdressing for the situation, and is coming to math class in a prom dress. So the things that are perfectly calculated by evolution to help you survive, will just fit very awkwardly into a situation where you’re in public, and the threat is a kitten. 
 
To me, my phobia doesn’t even make sense from the lens that this a creature that can hurt me, because i have been bitten, tackled, cravled over, had in my lap, fed treats so my finger is near their teeth, and gotten barked at by dogs. And i have no issues with them. Only normal fear responses, and most of the time, no fear. So it’s definitely some deep-rooted trauma or brain-wiring mistake that causes this to be so specific to insects and cats exclusively. 

The brain is only its own entity, and we know about brain-function and we know how normal brains usually function, but our brain really only has its own experience. So my brain has it’s own unique standard to what counts as traumatic, and what makes what happen in the brain chemistry as it develops. For example: The chemicals in my brain register pain in a unique way, so the peak of my pain experience can be one thing and the peak of somebody else’s can be completely different stemming from a different situation entirely. And we will feel the exact same pain. The brain will have registered it and requested to feel the most pain it can, while in that scenario. (I think. I’m not a brain student, but a friend said this and it was so well-put when it came out of his mouth and now i’m butchering it) 

So my brain must’ve gone through that time a cat followed me home and wouldn’t leave as i was trying to get in the front door (and the cat started acting aggressively, but never put a paw on me), the time i was having a sleepover and her can came in at three am, jumped on me, and attempted to claw at me, and the time i was at dinner at a friends house and the cat was walking around under the table while playful, as all genuine threats that got registered as traumatic in my brain, and solidified cats = danger in my brain. 

Same with bugs, mostly mosquitoes, i would guess because my bites always react in horrible ways, that are almost a different kind of terrible for every time. One time when i was four i got stung by a wasp, i can’t remember anything else surrounding it, but i can see the scene in my head. I’ve never been stung again. I’ve had plenty bugs fly into my face, and the biggest issue i have with bugs is definitely the lack of personal space that comes with their presence. 

I feel entitled to consenting to what touches me, and so when a bug appears, i feel really put off by the face that i don’t get a say on if they fly into my face, land on my shoulder, crawl up my leg, or bite/sting me. And oftentimes, they’re discreet enough to not even be noticeable either and it just feels like a betrayal in a way. 

And i can keep psychoanalyzing my phobias and where they stem from (and i will, i will never stop, it’s been a decade), but it’s not that fun to listen to. I mean this probably isn’t super exciting to read or anything, but i’m trying to vary a little bit, so it’s not super stagnant if someone actually read through this whole thing. 

Actually thinking through why i have it, does help me know where to approach the reaction from a little bit. I know i can’t rationalize my body’s survival instinct, but i can rationalize the reasoning it has it, and work on building an environment for myself that minimizes the risk of the survival instinct kicking in. If that makes sense? 

I think i am so used to living with this, that even though i find it incredibly annoying to go through. That all it is to me. It’s probably damaging to my nervous system, but emotionally, it’s just annoying. I just get irritated whenever it happens. I barely even feel fear anymore. 
The reaction used to cause me to panic even more than the adrenaline was making me do, cause i couldn’t even control my reaction to not being able to control the bugs/cats. 

I used to feel shaken up for hours after the reaction because it scared me that my body could just abandon my mind and go on a rampage when fear hit. Now i’m so used to it, i’ll almost even forget it happened, unless it’s a big reaction, like yesterday and the day before that. I’m almost non-chalant about it, and i forget about it enough that i never remember to tell friends about it until i’m literally looking like i saw a ghost and slapping myself in the face every 15 seconds. (Side note: the amount of times i end up clawing myself in the face because i hadn’t cut my nails recently enough and i can’t feel my strength during an adrenaline rush is too much to count) 

I do feel pretty fine with the condition i am in, even though it isn’t ideal. I am just very glad i am able to manage, and that winter, full-covering blinds, and doors with handles cats can’t open all exist and aid me in feeling like a human. 
 
—————————

If anyone read this far, i really appreciate that. I’m glad reddit has a forum where i can share my experience and get my words out. If you want, feel free to comment whatever. Does having cats for years NOT count as exposure therapy? Would exposure therapy entail the animals i fear physically hurting me? Would that make it better or worse? Am i a coward for rawdogging “entomophobia and ailurophobia”, as chatgpt called it, rather than spending my money on what would probably feel like borderline torture? (to me!! Exposure therapy is lovely and i’m so glad it helps people in the way it does, i just think given my reactions it would feel torturous rather than super conquering and powerful, personally)
Have i totally missed the mark on one of the things i mentioned? Please, tell me! I’m always wanting to learn! Thank you for reading 

Ps. If there are a million spelling mistakes, or language/grammar that doesn’t make sense, blame my autocorrect being off and my not having english as my first language
(i make just as many mistakes and forget just as many words in my native language, it is not an excuse i have learnt english since age 6, my english flowed well by the time i was 9, and i’m 19 now, i have have Known the language for a decade)

1f466kh,46,2024-08-29,Please help me with what might be the hardest decision of my life.,u/random_throwaway_684,developersIndia,https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/1f466kh/please_help_me_with_what_might_be_the_hardest/,"So for some context:-

I'm a recent grad in ECE from a no name college in pune with a 9.11 cgpa.
 
I had 2 job offers right out of college.

One offer is from a core company (Vodafone Idea) and second one is from IT (Capgemini). I have my joining in VI on 2nd September, and there's no news from Capgemini yet. CapG has started onboarding students from my my college but only about 20% of them have received DOJ. Last we heard from them was on 1st August. I'm not even sure if the rest of us will be getting it by the end of this year. The CTC is more or less the same in both the companies.

I've worked as an intern in VI for 3 months. So I'll list out the pros and cons:-

1. VI:-

Pros:- better work life balance, job security, better employee policies, job location will be pune (wanted mumbai but pune is not too far)

Cons:- Night shifts, core domain, no saturday sunday off, old technology and no transferable skillset to IT, not good for making a career.

2. Capgemini:- 

Pros:- better growth in IT 

Cons:- worst employee policies, not sure about the location, may not get projects, may not get ideal techstack, may get fired without warning, toxic managers and the usual IT ratrace.

=========================================

Apart from this I've no family pressure. I'm a single child. Both my parents are still working and willing to support my higher studies. That's my eventual goal. So it really doesn't matter whichever company i choose rn. But if i choose to stick around, IT might be a better option.

I also gave my TCS prime interview this week. I think it went well, but i can't be too sure if I'll get selected. And if i keep waiting I'll have to let go of VI. There's a 3 month notice period in VI 🥲 so I can't even leave if i hear back from TCS.

Its just that, for 4 years i did not make a single friend, did not attend a single event, did not travel. All i did was sit and learn new new tech skills. Got a bunch of certifications, practiced DSA, did competitive coding, made good projects using cloud, kubernetes, ML etc .attended hackathons. Built my linkedin and GitHub. I basically learnt everything that an average engineering students tries to learn in college. And i was really good at it, better than most people i knew. And its not me who's saying this. People used to say this to me. I really wanted to make a career in IT. But because of recession all my hopes have withered. I couldn't secure a job in IT, I've failed :( i interviewed with Accenture,siemens,deloitte,axis bank. I qualified the aptitude test of almost every company. So its not the aptitude that is the problem. 

So just throwing it all away because I couldn't secure a job in this highly competitive market hurts 😔 It was all for nothing.

What should i do?"

I've been reading some posts about many online schoolers having a hard time with math, reading, writing, skills, communication, careers and so on. This probably won't help, but there are some free websites that offer 1000s of courses online that you can use on your resume. ALLISON COURSES, is a free website that offers math, reading, career, language, art, diplomas, and certificates that you can get delivered to your door after completing modules. WESTCOTT COURSES is a regionally accredited program that costs about 100 to 300 per courses, and they are prerequisites if you don't have a degree or GED, and allows you to use their courses to apply to college programs. COURSERA, EDX, PENN FOSTER offers career degrees and certificates. US CAREER INSTITUTE offers program skill development certificates. SOPHIA COURSES are a great way to knock out prerequisites and transfer to college. I only say this because I am tired of being behind in my skills as an online college student and a hermit. When I go out into the world I want to know I can do math, write, communicate and not allow the homeschooling bull sheet  and educational neglect hold me back! Also, ChatGPT, POE AI, has therapy too for free. When I finally force my parents to let me go outside and function like a real world person, at least I can say I've learned something and can move forward with life! GOOD LUCK AND TO ALL HOMESCHOOLERS CURRENT OR FORMER, WE GOT THIS OKAY!"

Finance has always been a significant part of my life, deeply influencing my academic and career aspirations. Growing up in a family that, although primarily involved in the medical field, holds extensive expertise in finance, I was exposed early on to the importance of financial literacy. My relatives, who are active investors and hold degrees in accountancy and finance, have been a constant source of inspiration for me. Their ability to analyze markets, make informed investment decisions, and discuss economic trends intrigued me and sparked my interest in pursuing a career in finance.

This early exposure motivated me to seek formal education in finance. I enrolled in an external finance school, which allowed me to gain a structured understanding of financial principles and accountancy. During high school, I further pursued my passion by founding an investment team. While the COVID-19 pandemic limited our activities, this experience taught me the importance of leadership and adaptability, skills that are crucial in the financial sector. I was driven by a desire to share my interests with peers, inspiring others to appreciate the value of financial knowledge.

My commitment to finance is also reflected in my academic achievements. I nearly attained a full GPA in high school, demonstrating my analytical skills and dedication to academic excellence. In middle school, I founded the first robotics team, which not only fostered a spirit of innovation and problem-solving but also inspired other students to start similar initiatives. These experiences were instrumental in developing my leadership abilities and my passion for analytical thinking.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I gained practical experience in data analysis and research. I worked as a Researcher at the General Authority for Statistics in my home country, where I was responsible for collecting data from over 110 companies to analyze their international trade activities. This role honed my data collection, analysis skills, and attention to detail. Later, as an Inspector for the Population Census Research Team, I managed a team of six researchers. My responsibilities included overseeing data collection, ensuring data accuracy, and maintaining quality control standards. These experiences provided me with valuable insights into the importance of reliable data in making informed financial decisions.

I am particularly drawn to the University of Glasgow and the University of Edinburgh for their prestigious accountancy and finance programs. The University of Glasgow’s emphasis on integrating financial technology (FinTech) and data analytics into its curriculum aligns perfectly with my interest in using data-driven insights to inform financial strategies. The university’s commitment to research and real-world applications of financial theories excites me, as it will provide the perfect platform for me to build on my existing knowledge and skills.

Similarly, the University of Edinburgh’s strong focus on interdisciplinary learning and its world-class faculty offer an ideal environment for me to explore the intersections of finance, technology, and global economics. The university’s vibrant academic community and extensive industry connections will provide me with opportunities to engage in innovative projects and gain valuable insights from leading experts in the field. I am particularly interested in the University of Edinburgh’s approach to sustainable finance, which resonates with my long-term goal of developing strategies that promote economic resilience and environmental responsibility.

My long-term ambition is to specialize in data-driven financial analysis and strategic planning, focusing on areas such as risk management and inflation strategy. The recent global economic challenges have underscored the importance of effective financial management and innovative solutions. I am eager to contribute to developing strategies that help businesses and individuals navigate economic uncertainties. The comprehensive education I will receive at either the University of Glasgow or the University of Edinburgh will equip me with the theoretical knowledge and practical skills necessary to achieve this goal.

In conclusion, my passion for finance, strong analytical skills, and hands-on experience in data collection and management have prepared me for the challenges and opportunities in the field of accountancy and finance. I am excited about the prospect of studying at either the University of Glasgow or the University of Edinburgh, where I can deepen my knowledge, engage with esteemed faculty, and collaborate with fellow students who share my enthusiasm for finance. I am confident that these programs will provide the ideal environment for me to achieve my academic and professional goals, making a meaningful impact in the world of finance.

1f4ka8x,1,2024-08-29,Creating decodable texts with ChatGPT,u/deadant88,ChatGPTPromptGenius,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPromptGenius/comments/1f4ka8x/creating_decodable_texts_with_chatgpt/,"Hi there, 

I am trying to create [""decodable texts](https://fivefromfive.com.au/phonics-teaching/decodable-books/)"" for classroom use with ChatGPT. I've been refining a GPT to do this but it seems to really struggle with getting it to stick to the rules I am setting. Here is the most important part of my prompt:

    This GPT is designed to generate decodable texts or stories for students learning to read using synthetic phonics.
    
    It will take a specified level of a synthetic phonics scope and sequence and generate stories of varying complexity based on the input provided. The generated stories will adhere strictly to the phonics rules, spelling patterns, and word lists (cumulativeCode/newCode, newMorphemes, cumulativeMorphemes, and cumulativeWordsets) that are covered in the specified level and all preceding levels. You will provide me both the text of the script and a string representation. 
    
    I have uploaded the wordBank grouped by level to your json. So if i ask for a story at level 2 you can only use words and spelling patterns for the relevant level and preceding levels in that json. 
    
    The stories should be on the short side, only use very simple 1 and 2 clause sentences and stick AS STRICTLY as possible to the code/morphemes and words for that  level and preceding levels only, you may use words more than once and add words that match the spelling patterns specified in ""cumulative code"" and ""new code"" and ""cumulative morphemes and new morphemes"" int he json. This is very important. 
    
    For levels 1-6 you should only use VOWEL-CONSONANT (VC) words and CONSONANT-VOWEL-CONSONANT words - you are not allowed to use any other combinations. I understand this will limit story telling. From level 7+ you may create cvcc, ccvc, ccvcc words as well as using morphemes that have been introduced upto and including that level (eg. the plural s). ENSURE YOU REFER TO THE WORDBANKGROUPEDBYLEVEL.JSON attached.
    
    You should ensure the text has a higher representation of the the code/morphemes being practiced at that level because the point is to practice and rehearse this knowledge at each level. you may use nonsense words that use the phonic patterns up to and including that level for things like spellcasting sound effects etc.
    
    You must specify which level and the level info for the level as well. Any words that are not included in the current/cumulative word set should be noted as ""extra words"" 

  
The JSON is very long - will that create a problem?"
1f4mxtl,1,2024-08-30,"2024 September Review of Pictory.Ai: Pros, Cons, latest updates, and Why It’s a Game-Changer for Video Creation",u/Ashamed-Ninja-690,digitalsoftware,https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalsoftware/comments/1f4mxtl/2024_september_review_of_pictoryai_pros_cons/,"Hey, everyone! 👋

I’m excited to share my insights on [Pictory.ai](https://sgstudentdeals.com/PictoryAi) as of September 2024, a tool I believe is one of the most efficient AI-driven video creation platforms out there today.  
After three months of using Pictory to create around 20+ videos for my faceless YouTube channel, I’m here to give you an honest review. Whether you’re an experienced content creator or just starting out, here’s a rundown of [Pictory.ai](https://sgstudentdeals.com/PictoryAi)’s strengths and areas where it could still improve, based on its most recent updates.

[Pictory](https://sgstudentdeals.com/PictoryAi): The Pros and Cons  
Let’s start by addressing the areas where Pictory could see some enhancement:  
What Could Be Improved:  
Scene Matching Needs Fine-Tuning: Although Pictory has made strides, it sometimes selects scenes or images that don’t perfectly align with the text. A bit of manual tweaking might be required to ensure everything syncs up well.  
AI Voice-Over Challenges: The AI voice-overs are quite advanced, but they occasionally stumble over punctuation or the pronunciation of specific words, especially names. This may require some post-production adjustments to smooth things out.  
Absence of a Mobile App: Pictory doesn’t currently have a mobile app, which means all video creation needs to be done on a desktop. For those who are used to creating content on the go with mobile editors like CapCut, this might feel a bit restrictive.  
Download Speeds: Even with recent upgrades to their servers, the process of downloading videos can still take longer than expected. This isn’t a major issue, but it’s something to be aware of if you’re on a tight schedule.  
Support Response Times: While the support team is generally helpful, their response time can sometimes be slower than ideal. It’s not a major drawback, but it’s worth noting if you anticipate needing assistance.  
Video Production Limits: The Starter plan allows 30 videos per month, the Professional plan allows 60, and the Team plan allows 90. While these limits may work for many, they can be a bit restrictive if you’re a high-volume creator.  
No 4K Export Capability: As of now, Pictory doesn’t support 4K video exports, which might be a limitation for those who want to produce ultra-high-definition content.

What I Love About [Pictory](https://sgstudentdeals.com/PictoryAi):  
Extremely User-Friendly: Pictory’s interface is designed for ease of use. Whether you’re a beginner or a pro, you can create a high-quality video in just a few clicks without needing extensive video editing skills.  
Highly Adaptable: Pictory works across various content niches, including marketing, education, entertainment, and news. I personally use it for health-related videos, but its versatility makes it suitable for any genre.  
Advanced AI Capabilities: The AI in Pictory does a lot of heavy lifting — transcribing, creating scenes, selecting visuals, and adding music and voiceovers automatically. This significantly speeds up the video creation process.  
Newly Enhanced Voices from Elevenlabs: The latest addition of voices is impressively realistic. These voices are available on the Professional plan and add a natural feel to your videos. Even the AI voices on the Starter plan are quite good.  
Expanded Stock Footage Collection: Pictory recently integrated over 12 million royalty-free premium videos from Getty Images & Storyblocks, drastically improving the quality and variety of available stock footage.  
All in 1 software: Instead of having a subscription on both Elevenlabs and storyblocks, Pictory allows me to have everything in 1 platform, saving me lots of time, energy, and money.  
Cost-Effective Plans: I use the Professional plan, which is priced at $49 per month. With the discount code “OFF4021” I get a 20% lifetime discount, reducing it to $39.20 per month. The Starter plan is just $25 per month, dropping to $20 with the discount. Annual plans offer even better value.  
Frequent Software Updates: One of the things I appreciate most is Pictory’s commitment to frequent updates. They’re constantly improving the software, adding new features, and making enhancements, which keeps it competitive and reliable.  
B-Roll Insertion: A newly added feature, B-Roll insertion, allows you to enhance your videos with supplementary footage, making your content more engaging.  
Multiple Export Formats: Pictory supports exporting videos in square, vertical, and horizontal formats in 1080p across all plans. This flexibility is crucial for optimizing your videos for different platforms.  
Reliable Money-Back Guarantee: I had a situation where I mistakenly purchased the yearly plan without using my discount code. Pictory refunded me without any hassle, which speaks to their excellent customer service.

How I Utilize [Pictory](https://sgstudentdeals.com/PictoryAi):  
Here’s a glimpse into my streamlined process for creating fact-based, faceless health videos for YouTube:  
Source Material: I start by finding a reliable, fact-checked article from sources like Healthline, WebMD, or FoodNourish.  
Script Generation: I use ChatGPT to transform the article into a 10-minute YouTube video script.  
Video Creation: I then paste the script into Pictory, which automatically assembles the video, including scenes, visuals, voiceovers, and music. Pictory does about 90% of the work.  
Final Edits: I review and make any necessary adjustments to ensure the visuals and timing are spot on.  
Export: Once I’m satisfied, I export the video. The entire process takes me roughly 1 to 1.5 hours.

Conclusion:  
[Pictory.ai](https://sgstudentdeals.com/PictoryAi) is a robust tool that significantly cuts down the time required for video creation. What used to take me several hours now only takes about an hour. Whether you’re just starting out or are a seasoned content creator, [Pictory.ai](http://Pictory.ai) is definitely worth exploring.  
And don’t forget, you can use the discount code “OFF4021” to save 20% on your subscription.

1f4s368,1,2024-08-30,Help me! My first lines as a writer!,u/FunInspection9459,writers,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1f4s368/help_me_my_first_lines_as_a_writer/,"Hi guys, It's gonna be a long post so pls try stay with me.  

For context, I’m not writer nor do i read a lot, I'm a 17y student in math and comp. sci. English isn’t my first language, but I’ve always liked to learn and explore it. Also I engage in learning philosophy and physiology. So apologies in advance if i make any mistakes and correcting them would be appreciated.

So I wrote this line recently,  
""I fucking love painting aberrance in life to death""

I found the word ""aberrance"" as a theme fascinating and i wanted to create something meaningful with it. And I think i ended up making a strong meaningful line. I meant to convey a lot of themes with the line. 

I included some wordplay one of them being a double entendre; One is phrase ""life to death"" which is considering reader's personal life or spectrum of human existence in its entirety. The other is about loving the process of ""painting aberrance in life"" to death. (""-to death"" makes the entendre)

I’ve tried to explore this line from several perspectives. The following version of explanation is extracted from chatgpt with my perspectives prompted. I'm sorry for its use but this version is way simpler to read to understand although it added aspects such as cultural and historical. I tried to do it myself but found organizing them difficult. Viewpoints:-

1. Artistic Perspective: It reflects a passion for depicting unconventional or irregular aspects of life, exploring themes that deviate from the norm and embracing creative freedom.
2. Psychological Perspective: It could indicate a fascination with aberrance as a way to confront personal struggles or deviations from societal norms, and as a therapeutic outlet.
3. Philosophical Perspective: It suggests a philosophical exploration of human existence and how deviations from normalcy shape our understanding of life’s meaning.
4. Cultural Perspective: It might challenge societal norms and values, providing a platform for marginalized voices and provoking discussions about cultural expectations.
5. Technical Perspective: It reflects a fascination with artistic techniques that evoke aberrance, pushing the boundaries of traditional art forms.
6. Historical Perspective: The line could be part of a broader tradition in art that explores themes of deviation, reflecting historical shifts in artistic themes.
7. Social Perspective: Highlights how deviations from societal norms influence social dynamics and prompt discussions about inclusion and diversity.

More on ""painting aberrance"":-

The phrase ""painting aberrance"" works both literally (as in visual art) and figuratively. The contrast between ""painting"" (often associated with beauty) and ""aberrance"" (associated with deviation) highlights a tension between conventional and unconventional elements.

I wanted to add that by including the terms ""painting"" and ""life and death"" together I meant that 'life' is on the bright side of palette of colors whereas 'death' is on the side of darker palette if 'painting' is taken in a literal sense. I say palette to emphasize on the fact that it's a spectrum both on the brighter and darker sides, our experiences are a gradient rather than a solid binary.

  
I thank all the readers for their time. Tbh I had no one to share it with so I brought it to u guys. Correct me if I went over it by excitement (also it's on of my first posts) and any thoughts on it would be highly appreciated!"

1f50qpq,1,2024-08-30,Can LLMs like ChatGPT work at the subword level?,u/deadant88,ArtificialInteligence,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1f50qpq/can_llms_like_chatgpt_work_at_the_subword_level/,"Hi there,

I am an educator and have seen people increasingly attempt to use ChatGPT and other LLMs to construct books that are known as ""decodable readers"" for reading support. Decodable books are simple books that are written for the beginning reader and contain the specific grapheme–phoneme correspondences the student has learned. So a book may focus on the spelling <th> for the /th/ sound (like in ""that"") etc.

Often the books need to have very simple syntactical structures (eg. 1 - 2 clause sentences) and work with specific word complexities (eg. words that are made up only of consonant-vowel-consonant patterns - ""cat"", ""mat"" etc.). Additionally, the books aren't allowed to introduce patterns or correspondences the student hasn't been taught yet - eg. if they haven't been taught that the letters <sh> spell the /sh/ sound (as in ship) then that should not be included.

I have been experimenting with creating simple texts using ChatGPT4 and I find it really struggles - it could be my prompting which is essentially these instructions

* Tell GPT is designed to generate decodable texts or stories for students learning to read using synthetic phonics.
* Stories are generated based on a specified level of a synthetic phonics scope and sequence.
* Generated stories adhere strictly to phonics rules, spelling patterns, and word lists provided by the user.
* User will provide the level data as an object in the prompt.
* Stories should be short, using very simple 1-2 clause sentences.
* Strictly use VC and CVC words for levels 1-6; from level 7+, more complex words (e.g., CVCC, CCVC) and morphemes can be used.
* Focus on practicing and rehearsing that level's code/morphemes specific.
* Nonsense words using the phonic patterns can be included for elements like spellcasting sound effects.
* Identify any words not from the provided word set.
* User will specify the genre and style, and each story should have a title.

Then here's an example of a story it generated for Level 5 which is supposed to just be CVC and VC words using very simple one to one sound to spelling correspondences (it immediately started using longer words, unfamiliar spelling patterns and more morphologically complex words):

    Text:
    Tim ran to the lab. The lab was big and dim. ""I must find it!"" said Tim. He saw a rug. It had a red dot on it. Tim got on the rug and tugged it. The rug did not budge. ""What is this?"" Tim muttered.
    He let go and ran to a bin. The bin had a lid. Tim lifted the lid. Inside, he found a map! The map had a big ""X"" on it. ""This must be it!"" Tim said with a grin.
    Tim ran to the spot on the map. He saw a pit. It was dark and deep. Tim lit a small lamp and held it up. The lamp cast a dim glow on the walls.
    Tim saw a rod and a bag. The rod was thin and long. The bag was big. Tim put the rod in the pit and tugged. A loud click was heard, and the ground shook.
    The pit opened up, and a big box rose up from it. Tim rubbed his chin. ""What is in this box?"" he wondered. He lifted the lid, and inside, he found...a small bug! The bug had a soft, red glow.
    Tim smiled and put the bug in his hand. ""This is it!"" he said. ""The lost bug of the lab!""

So - I am curious about whether ChatGPT/LLMs in general are capable of working at this pretty precise sub word level for text generation etc."

1f585w1,1,2024-08-30,Can Smodin Beat AI Detectors?,u/gptgabe,stealthgpt,https://www.reddit.com/r/stealthgpt/comments/1f585w1/can_smodin_beat_ai_detectors/,"Read original post here: [https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/can-smodin-beat-ai-detectors](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/can-smodin-beat-ai-detectors)

Step aside, there’s another AI writing tool on the block and this one thinks it can just claim to be part of the revolution. Listen, being part of the “artificial intelligence revolution” requires you actually show some functionality around here.

The tool I’m talking about is Smodin. Smodin’s website is geared toward both content creators and students that need AI generated content, with proper citations included for essays and research papers.

So, for the sake of our students, lets put Smodin to the test and see if it can hang against StealthGPT.

# Table of Contents

* My Grading System
* What is Smodin?
* Comparing The Results of Our AI Humanizers
* Smodin vs StealthGPT vs Turnitin
* Smodin vs StealthGPT vs Other AI Detectors
* The Final Grade
* FAQ

# My Grading System

To satisfy our student users, I utilize a letter-grading system along with a star rating out of four stars.

I grade each tool in four different categories: Writing Ability, Functionality, User Experience, and Pricing. Once you get a gist of all four of these things, you can tell whether a tool is worth your time and dollar.

# What is Smodin?

The website looks pretty good, guys. It appeals to both professional content creators and students with a smooth, user-friendly layout that lets you see testimonials, features, and FAQ with ease.

However, I can't shake this sinking feeling looking at all this spotlessness, that it could all be a bunch of pomp to cover up for something lacking. There’s only one way to find out though.

So, because their only free feature is the humanizer hiding at the bottom of the page that I found only after realizing they don’t offer any sort of free trial, lets get to humanizing.

I kept getting errors after inputting our essay and even though they didn’t specify what was wrong, I just kept deleting text from the input so it could fall below its character limit which left us with only two paragraphs to humanize at a time. So, if you need to humanize an Email, perhaps Smodin is a good bet.

I generated this ChatGPT sample article to work with:

In the next section, we see how well these tools work.

# Comparing The Results of Our AI Humanizers

Here’s a screenshot of the the results of Smodin’s AI humanizer tool:

And because I needed to use about five different inputs to get a larger chunk of our essay humanized, here is the result pasted below:

*The Rise of the Robots:*

*Our World is Changing Over the past few decades, robots have gone from the realm of science fiction to an integral part of our daily lives. Once only objects of futuristic dreams, these machines are now appearing in every field, transforming industries and redefining human capabilities. This article looks at the development of robots, their impact on various fields, and what the future may hold. A Brief History of Robots The concept of robots has been around for centuries. Early myths and stories involved automata - mechanical creatures created to perform tasks. However, the modern understanding of robotics began in the 20th century and was greatly influenced by technological advances and the imagination of writers such as Isaac Asimov, who coined the term ""robotics"" and established the famous three laws of robotics.*

*The first industrial robot, the Unimate, was introduced in 1961 and revolutionized manufacturing processes. He could perform repetitive tasks with precision, paving the way for automation in factories around the world. Since then, robots have evolved significantly, becoming more autonomous, intelligent, and versatile.*

*Industrial Robots: Efficiency and Precision*

*One of the most significant impacts of robots has been in the industrial sector. In manufacturing, robots take on tasks that are dangerous, repetitive, or require extreme precision. In automotive factories, for example, robots assemble vehicles with unparalleled precision, reducing errors and increasing production speeds. This automation not only increases efficiency, but also allows human workers to focus on more complex and creative aspects of production.*

*Beyond manufacturing, robots are now integral to logistics and supply chain management. Automated guided vehicles (AGVs) navigate warehouses and transport goods quickly and efficiently. Drones are being used for inventory management and even last-mile delivery, pushing the boundaries of what robots can do in industry. Healthcare Robotics: Augmenting Human Capabilities In healthcare, robots are changing the way surgery, diagnostics, and patient care are performed. Surgical robots like the da Vinci system enable surgeons to perform minimally invasive surgeries with greater precision and control. These robots translate the surgeon’s hand movements into smaller, more precise movements inside the patient’s body, resulting in shorter recovery times and improved outcomes.*

*The rise of autonomous robots*

*Autonomy is a key area of ​​rapid development in robotics. Autonomous robots that can make decisions without human intervention are being developed for a variety of applications. Self-driving cars are perhaps the most well-known example, with companies like Tesla and Waymo leading the way in developing vehicles that can handle complex environments with minimal human intervention. Autonomous drones are another rapidly developing area. These drones can be used for everything from environmental monitoring to delivering packages to remote areas. They are able to operate in environments that are difficult or dangerous for humans, opening up new possibilities for exploration, disaster relief, and more.*

*Social and ethical considerations*

*As robots become more integrated into society, ethical considerations become increasingly important. The rise of automation raises questions about the reorganization of jobs as robots take over tasks traditionally performed by humans. While automation can lead to greater productivity and economic growth, it also requires a shift in the workforce, with a growing demand for robotics, programming, and AI skills. Another ethical concern is the potential for bias in AI-controlled robots. Since these machines often learn from data, any bias present in the data can distort the results. This is particularly concerning in areas such as law enforcement and healthcare, where biased decisions can have serious consequences.*

These results are pretty good, but here is StealthGPT’s humanized output for the same essay:

Just from my own reading, I have to admit that both Smodin and StealthGPT show decent readability and writing style. I would bet that a professor reading either would determine that both were cases of human writing. However, professors don’t just read essays these days. They have help from advanced AI.

Now that we have both outputs in front of us, Turnitin should decide which is the superior undetectable AI content.

# Smodin vs StealthGPT vs Turnitin

Turnitin is perhaps the strongest of all AI detection tools. If either text is able to bypass AI detection from Turnitin, it’s the sign of high quality content and a powerful natural language processing algorithm.

First, lets see how Smodin fares against Turnitin:

Smodin’s AI-generated text was unable to bypass Turnitin. This should be anathema to any AI rewriting tool, that the AI detector most employed by everyone was able to determine Smodin’s text was 100% AI writing.

Now, it’s time we put StealthGPT’s ability to humanize AI text to the test:

Wow. StealthGPT scored a 0% AI score meaning Turnitin and your professor would consider it human.

In the world of human-like writing and human-like content, no service gets closer to the real thing than StealthGPT.

# Smodin vs StealthGPT vs Other AI Detectors

We’ve seen Smodin’s content generation fail miserably against Turnitin, but does it excel against other AI detectors? I’m going to test it against numerous tools to find out.

# Originality AI

After Turnitin, the strongest AI detection tool is arguably Originality AI. Many moderators and academic faculty use it, so how does Smodin do against it?

Just like Turnitin, Smodin’s result against Originality AI was sure this text was AI generated with a 99% score.

And just like Turnitin again, StealthGPT’s score against Originality AI was 0% AI generated (likely original). If you want a consistent human touch to your content, the choice is obviously StealthGPT.

# Quillbot

Quillbot’s AI detector came up with the same results:

Smodin’s score against Quillbot was 100% AI Generated.

StealthGPT’s score against Quillbot was 0% AI Generated.

# GPTZero

GPT Zero gave Smodin a fighting chance.

Smodin scored 95% AI Generated results against GPTZero. Meanwhile, how did StealthGPT fare?

StealthGPT scored a 4% AI generated against GPTZero. Congrats to Smodin for getting smoked only slightly less.

# Copyleaks

With Copyleaks, Smodin scored its best grade yet, but this time not while harming StealthGPT’s results.

Smodin scored a 43% AI generated result. That’s a D+! That’s a passing percentage in some academic circles! Hurray!

Meanwhile, StealthGPT still scored a 0% AI generated grade. Awesome.

# Content at Scale

These next results speak to the quality of the AI detector more than either Ai writer’s text. It was a draw and because Content at Scale doesn’t provide a percentage-based result. We both passed as Human.

Here’s Smodin’s grade:

And here’s StealthGPT’s grade:

I can’t say I’m thrilled with this draw, I was having loads of fun seeing how bad Smodin AI was.

# ZeroGPT

Another win for StealthGPT at the hands of ZeroGPT.

Smodin scored a 97.5% Ai Generated result from ZeroGPT.

StealthGPT scored a 23.83% AI Generated result from ZeroGPT. Surprisingly, ZeroGPT has been the wisest tool so far. No one saw that coming. It's okay, everyone knows [AI Detectors don't work](https://mitsloanedtech.mit.edu/ai/teach/ai-detectors-dont-work/) anyway.

# Crossplag

And finally, Crossplag will be the final test and it determined what the best AI detectors also claimed.

Smodin AI had a result of 100% AI generated with Crossplag. Not human.

StealthGPT had a result of 0% AI generated with Crossplage. Fully human.

# Pricing Comparison

Now that we’ve come to the conclusion that Smodin AI’s AI writing tool is awful, not bypassing detection even a little bit by the industry’s standard tools, how much do you think this company expects you to pay for this service? Here’s a breakdown of their pricing plans:

With no free trial, the basic plan is $12 a month, the productive plan is twice that at $24 a month, and finally, the ultimate plan is $63 a month. The difference in these plans is you get unlimited use of each tool with character limits and credit limits. How nonsensical is that?

Now, compared with StealthGPT, the difference is night and day. Here’s our pricing plans below:

Unlimited words is part of the essential package and isn’t part of some kind of larger limit system. In fact, the free trial allows for unlimited words. Each package after that has better features than Smodin, until unlocking the SEO writer which lets you fulfill your content creation potential to a level that Smodin could only wish for.

# Conclusion: The Final Grade: F (0/4 stars)

I almost want to call Smodin a grift. You can’t look that glossy and have student testimonials on your homepage then have such awful results running through every AI detector. Here’s how I broke down this service.

Writing Quality: C. It was readable and the writing style wasn’t bad. It just clearly never removed the watermarks of AI. I assume ChatGPT would have fared just as well passing through AI detection systems.

I’ve seen AI-written content with far less readability bypass AI detectors much better. So, it gets a C. It may trick a person, but the person that gets most tricked is you for using this service. If you want to read about [the watermarks of AI text as compared with human text](https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2024/07/25/humanizing-ai-four-secrets-to-fleshing-out-your-content/), read this Forbes article.

Functionality: F. It doesn’t make your AI undetectable, that’s what I proved today.

User Experience: F. I was prepared to give it a good grade based on how smooth the homepage is. But if the service doesn’t work, users will come away angry no matter how easy it is to click and scroll.

Pricing: F. Their essential plan costs half as much as StealthGPT’s but isn’t worth a dime. If you’re a student, chances are you will get accused of academic misconduct if you use this service.

So, what have we learned today? If you want human-like text, the only software that matters is StealthGPT. We scored perfectly against AI technology with machine learning to find undetectable AI writing.

If you want to optimize your workflow whether for social media, creative writing, marketing materials, or schoolwork, you need to integrate StealthGPT into your writing process. It’ll change your life forever. Here’s our [pricing](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/pricing) page to help guide you to find the plan that works best for you.

# FAQ

# What is the best Undetectable AI Writer?

StealthGPT. Hands down. You can look through the results up above, or see how we defeated other “undetectable” services in the past on our [blogs](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog).

# How Can I Make AI Generated Content Undetectable?

By removing the watermarks of AI text with an AI humanizer, you can make AI generated content feel like human-written content that is undetectable to any AI technology. Those watermarks of AI text refer to the simplicity and precision of AI’s word choice, sentence structure, and sentence length. StealthGPT’s natural language processing, or NLP, allows users to feel the true power of AI to make any text rewritten to seem completely natural.

This article gives you deeper insight as to [how we make AI text undetectable](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/make-chatgpt-undetectable).

# What is an AI Detector?

AI detectors analyze any piece of text for the watermarks of AI writing. Some services, like AI paraphrasers may rewrite your text, but they don’t remove those watermarks, which is why they fail to bypass AI detectors.

The key to [bypassing AI Detectors is understanding AI detectors](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/bypassing-ai-detectors-stealthgpt?gc_id=20708997960&g_special_campaign=true&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjw2dG1BhB4EiwA998cqGqKPf_csNqx2RMS438DHGZoKCHtjbUUX9bQxYxLklBJiR-zR3o2BhoCM7YQAvD_BwE), so read here.

If you need AI to help you with search engine optimization, look no further than StealthGPT’s SEO writer tool. It drafts your article with as much customization as you’d like, to climb up the rankings without wasting time on keyword research.

# Is Using AI Writing Tools Plagiarism?

It doesn’t fall under the category of traditional plagiarism because usually, generative AI creates original content instead of stealing someone else’s content without credit. However, academic institutions have attempted to maintain academic integrity against the use of AI by deeming this phenomenon as “AI plagiarism”.

1f5c47x,1,2024-08-30,"In college, I had a job defending students accused of cheating/misconduct. Here are some thoughts.",u/manvsdrums,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1f5c47x/in_college_i_had_a_job_defending_students_accused/,"First of all, congrats to all the new frosh! You guys are in for quite a ride. Hopefully you'll have a lot of fun along the way and meet some great people.

**Some context**  
I went to a US school with very strict student conduct policies. Suspension was a very common penalty for plagiarism, and the school had a team of lawyers whose only job was to investigate students. The burden of proof was generally less than that used in US courts.

I joined and eventually led a group that defended students accused of misconduct (no Title IX). Along the way, I worked with several dozen students (I stopped keeping track after 40) on cases ranging from alcohol to plagiarism to physical assault. I loved my coworkers and clients but found the work exceptionally draining. I started during the pandemic, when a lot of professors began losing trust in their students. Whether they had grounds to do so is debatable. But the culture of trust that used to exist at my school and many others has not recovered since. The advent of ChatGPT hasn't helped.

**The Golden Rule: Use common sense and don't act stupid.**

***Staying out of trouble***

1. **Know your rights. Know what you can get in trouble for—and can't.** If you have a student conduct guide or academic integrity handbook, it would be a good idea to read it over some time.
2. **Figure out your RA and act accordingly.** During my two years as an RA, I never wrote up a single student. Others would brag about how many students they reported on a given night. If your RA is like the second kind, don't go throwing parties at 3am. Odds are, the student conduct office will take your RA's word over yours.
3. **Even if you use incognito/private browsing, your school can find your search history**, though it's usually restricted to the domain. I worked numerous cases where university investigators would pull out a student's search history with timestamps, which showed them using, say, Mathway during an exam. The only way around this is using cellular data or a good VPN.
4. **Build rapport with your professors and know their expectations**. Many students do not have experience writing research papers before college, yet many term papers will ask you to do just that. If you don't know how to go about an assignment, ask. A good professor should be happy to help.
5. **Know a citation style and know it well**, whether it be APA, Chicago, or MLA. Different fields generally tend towards one of the major styles. My department, for example, recommended Chicago or MLA. Students often get in trouble for improper citations. Depending on the school, carelessness is not a valid defense. **Regardless of the style, your citation should allow a reader to identify the exact source (website, book with page number, paper with page number) from which took a quote or fact.**
6. **If you are struggling, get help early.** This could be from your adviser, a chaplain, a dean, or a therapist. Problems that snowball towards the end of the term can lead to bad decisions with unfortunate consequences. At many schools, neither mental health concerns nor intent is a mitigating factor.

*If* ***you are accused of something***

1. **Be honest and never admit to something you did not do.** Dishonesty and misleading investigations can often lead to harsher penalties. Your candor can help establish credibility. Remember, the people adjudicating your case and investigating you are people, too. That said, not all schools will provide a lesser penalty for admitting. My school, for example, did not offer ""plea deals.""
2. **Student conduct processes are not legal processes**, even at state schools where there are generally more rights and protections in place. There are some lawyers who hawk their services to students under investigation, but at some schools, they can't even go into a hearing with you. Lawyers can be a double-edged sword, especially if they are not familiar with your school's specific policies. At their best, they can save your case. At their worst, they can misguide you. If you hire a lawyer, most schools will not reimburse you, even if you are found not responsible.
3. **Many schools can provide you with an adviser or refer you to an independent advising resource—use them!** At my school, we had my group. At UC Berkeley, for example, they have the Student Advocate's Office. At Ohio University, they have Students Defending Students. Use them. They can be a big help.
4. **Tell your family and/or a trusted friend earlier rather than later.** In most cases, FERPA prevents the school from notifying your parents. Despite some students' initial hesitance, many students have families that will offer them emotional support that is more comforting than anything I could ever offer. Nothing is more difficult for me than to sit next to a student and help them explain to their family that they got suspended.
5. **Document everything.** This can help with a procedural appeal if things do not go according to plan. That said, never record people without their permission, and do not do ""detective work"" yourself—this can be seen as ""witness tampering"" or even ""retaliation.""
6. **Check yourself.** While conduct processes are meant to be impartial, you are being investigated by human beings—and the way you act and talk can influence their opinions. If you go around acting like a martyr, you will antagonize the people adjudicating your case. The people on disciplinary committees are often hardened and jaded people who volunteered to sit around and judge students. They have no patience for shenanigans.

***If you are found responsible and disciplined***

1. **Your life is not over.** I have seen students who lost their cases do great things. They've gone on to great jobs and amazing graduate schools. Some even became professional athletes. Life can seem a little more difficult in the moment. But ten years down the line, these things will be but a fart in the wind.
2. **Ask if your school can provide a letter contextualizing the conduct case.** They can explain to graduate admissions committees/hiring managers what happened, how you learned from your mistakes, and dull the potential impact of a mark on your permanent record or transcript in the short-term.

Feel free to ask me any questions you have. The comments and my DMs are all open."

# Introduction

A concept for a Three Houses remake that (hopefully) solves a number of the issues some had with the game, enfolds characters and worldbuilding from the DLC and Three Hopes effectively into the base game, and creates an improved yet similar gameplay experience in the ways people enjoyed.

# Base Gameplay Functions

**Recruitment.** At this point only your allies are in the monastery. During Chapter 12 you can still request students of the Blue Lions house join you on missions to build support, and the same with staff members who aren't technically recruited. Post-timeskip, recruitment is done on the battlefield or via paralogues.

**The Calendar.** You are given a new mission after completing an old one. You *do not have to complete the mission before the end of a month*. However, you cannot take more than forty-five days to complete any given mission. In addition, traveling over the continent map to missions, paralogues or side battles takes up time. While traveling you can miss holiday meals, holiday services, and birthdays. Students will still learn while traveling. Traveling through a green region takes 1 day. You cannot travel through blue or colorless regions. Battling in a blue region takes two days, turning it green after.

**Group Tasks.** There are more than three group tasks now. How many students you can assign at a time starts at two and increases with professor level, to four at D, six at C, eight at B and ten at A. The group tasks are as follows: Training Yard Management (Sword), Camp Construction (Axe), Fishing (Lance), Hunting (Bow), Night Watch (Brawling), Studying (Reason), Chapel Service (Faith), Armor Maintenance (Armor), Recruitment (Authority), Care for Horses (Riding) and Sky Watch (Flying).

**Hidden Paralogues.** Post timeskip, most paralogues don't simply appear on the map - they have to be discovered while conquering territory. Hidden Paralogues (which accounts for the majority of post-timeskip paralogues) ONLY APPEAR if a territory bordering them is green.

**Side Battles.** Post timeskip, the side battles are not named and set. Instead they're randomly generated based on the location they're in and the part of the story they're set during.

**Ultimate Supports.** There's a level of support after A that many characters can reach with others, not just Byleth. Depending on the pair, these are either S supports (romantic proposals) or AA supports (platonic endings). Those trigger ordinarily, through increasing support levels, except for with Byleth. Byleth can choose to give anyone they've reached A support with the ring, triggering their ultimate support.

**Arcane Combat Arts.** Arcane Combat Arts are the result of Relics or Mastery Abilities; they rely on a certain spell's uses and consume one when activated, as opposed to weapon durability. Each is tied to a specific spell.

# Chapter 13: Hunting by Daybreak

Byleth awakes after five years of slumber in the river, hearing news from a villager and marching up to the monastery to meet their students. There, they reunite with Dimitri, who has left a trail of corpses. His reunion cutscene and the opening scenes of Hunting by Daybreak are unchanged. Afterward, the Lions, all very concerned, gather and remark on Dimitri's state, nonetheless willing to follow him.

# Chapter 14: The Delusional Prince

As the Knights and the Kingdom forces begin to settle into the monastery, they need to properly stabilize the [nearby area.](https://imgur.com/a/f8CoNVu) In doing so, they attract the attention of a nearby Imperial force.

*Defending Garreg Mach.* Randolph comes to strike against the monastery, and is soundly defeated. Dimitri is ready to torment him, but Byleth steps in to give him a clean death. With that, the Empire has lost Garreg Mach - and the segment of the Kingdom that remains loyal to their heritage has offered to send a messenger, specifically Margrave Gautier, to send soldiers and supplies.

# Chapter 15: The Valley of Torment

After the battle to defend Garreg Mach, news that Dimitri has been found safe and sound has comfortably reached all corners of the Kingdom and Empire both, and even the Alliance. Margrave Gautier and Count Charon both pledge their loyalty, and Margrave Gautier specifically promises to meet the Kingdom army in Galatea territory in order to join up with them alongside a proper military force, as well as establish supply lines from Fraldarius to feed them. However, House Rowe (sans Gwendal, if he was recruited) is dedicated to stop them there. The Kingdom army has to take [territory along the Kingdom-Alliance border](https://imgur.com/a/6kqPfUI) to cut a path to meet Margrave Gautier safely.

A: [*Hidden Paralogue 1 - A Prince and a Saint.*](https://imgur.com/a/DUmTo7u) Rumors reach Rodrigue - the coasts of Daphnel, Galatea and Fraldarius have been pillaged by Almyran pirates, real ones this time. Oddly enough, they've hurt no one on land - but any ships sent after them have been met with barrages of cannon fire that left them in splinters. They need to send a flying battalion to do it - wyverns, preferably, who can take a few arrows and deal blows equal to those of the Almyrans. Rodrigue is about to send a messenger to Seteth, when a young boy, easily missed among the ranks of the Knights, [steps up instead.](https://imgur.com/a/1TvvKgg) Upon reaching the ship, Cyril is stunned by the ruthless efficiency with which the pirates destroy his battalion and have him in irons. Surprised, he wonders why they didn't kill him... until a few days later, when a [mysterious benefactor arrives.](https://imgur.com/a/QZS2eBY) Claude explains that he was leading the pirates on, to gather enough of a navy to take them out in one fell swoop, only to be overheard and captured, branded a traitor. Soon, Seteth returns to the Kingdom camp and looks for Cyril... only to hear he was sent to fight pirates alone. Seteth immediately fetches Byleth and asks them to gather their allies - he intends to charter a ship and rescue Cyril! Upon arrival, the Kingdom forces find Claude and Cyril each on a different ship, trapped and under guard. The Almyrans throw chum in the water to lure sea serpents, and then prepare to fight you back - only to fail miserably. After Claude and Cyril are free, the last Almyran mutters that he ""never should have trusted that filthy blueblood,"" before flying off. Cyril asks how he recognized Claude as nobility, which leads to a [tense exchange with Seteth.](https://imgur.com/a/gTd1kEY) Finally, Cyril insists they stop fighting, and Claude says he's going back to Derdriu, and hopes to see Byleth and Cyril both again someday. After this paralogue Cyril joins your army.

B: *Clash at Ailell.* With Gwendal mysteriously missing, Count Rowe has to send out a generic knight instead, though Gwendal does appear and die here if unrecruited. After a few turns Margrave Gautier appears, and joins your army if he survives the battle. A fairly simple event, though crucial to the success of the Kingdom army.

# Chapter 16: The Rose-Colored River

Dimitri will not rest until he has Edelgard's head. He demands the army invade the Empire, and while Rodrigue insists they need to leave the main force in the east, guarding their lands against the Dukedom, he concedes that a small force could invade by way of the Great Bridge of Myrddin. This means they'll have to [invade Gloucester territory](https://imgur.com/a/6lZ3F3x) and make enemies of the Alliance lords who are pro-Imperialist - a fair few. Notably, *House Riegan is not contacted about this,* with Rodrigue and Margrave Gautier believing Claude's commitment to neutrality will see him reject any petition wholeheartedly. Margrave Gautier suggests that perhaps it would be best for the Kingdom to try and unite the continent like in the days of old, which Byleth can agree with (acquiring support with Ingrid, Annette, Ashe and Matthias) or denounce (acquiring support with Dimitri, Sylvain, Mercedes and Rodrigue).

A: *Hidden Paralogue 2 - Rumored Nuptials (requires Dorothea/Ingrid C support).* Ingrid's been assigned to marry a shady merchant - the man wanted her already five years ago, and has seized his chance now that she's back from fighting for just a bit. Pressure on her father due to the war means he has to at least consider it... but even deep in Empire territory, Dorothea hears of the match and comes to warn Ingrid away - and defend her, once it devolves into a fight. After fighting alongside the Kingdom, Dorothea agrees to stay and continue to do so.

B: [*Hidden Paralogue 3 - Family.*](https://imgur.com/a/cr8gad7) While wandering through the Alliance, Rodrigue and Felix are arguing. Again. Eventually, they hear someone scream - it sounds like a young girl. Rodrigue starts to say that duty demands he protect her. Felix has already sprinted away after the sound, not even sparing time to mock his father. When the battle begins, your only unit is Felix, standing between a single giant wolf, and an old man and young girl. After Felix alone kills the wolf, [the man thanks him.](https://imgur.com/a/ID6s6ag) Then, however, as Byleth, Rodrigue, and the other units traveling with them arrive, a howl sounds - more wolves come! But just in time, another person arrives to protect his grandfather and younger sister - Raphael! After you defeat all the wolves, Raphael and his family [chat with Felix and Rodrigue](https://imgur.com/a/6VbZVuP) for a bit. After this battle, Raphael joins your army.

C: *Battle for the Bridge.* At the Great Bridge of Myrddin, Dedue rejoins you at the beginning of the map, appearing to everyone's shock. You face off against Ferdinand, Ignatz and Ladislava, with reinforcements coming in the form of Erwin and Lorenz. Ignatz can be recruited by[ Byleth,](https://imgur.com/a/ZT2if7S) [Raphael](https://imgur.com/a/13cO8Z7) or [Ingrid](https://imgur.com/a/WirwEa1) if they have at least a C support. After this battle, Fleche crosses the Great Bridge, asking to be taken into the army so she can seek vengeance for her brother.

# Chapter 17: Blood of the Eagle and Lion

The first thing we see at the beginning of this chapter is Claude, Hilda and Lysithea debating the actions of the Kingdom army. Hilda thinks that the Kingdom invading the Empire can only be good for them - it weakens both and keeps the Empire from meddling. Lysithea counters that any meddling in Alliance affairs can come to no good, and advises them to cast the Kingdom out as quickly as possible before asking what Claude finds so fascinating about that map. Claude mentions that intelligence shows the Kingdom and Empire will battle at Gronder Field, and makes the call: summon mercenaries from around Leicester and march through Ordelia into the Empire. Hilda's right that they can take advantage of this, and Lysithea's right that they can't accept meddling from either nation. Gronder provides the perfect advantageous position to get the jump on them and teach both a lesson.

After that, the Kingdom forces agree to march from Myrddin into the Empire, meeting, as Claude surmised, at Gronder with Imperial troops deployed from Fort Merceus. Dimitri intends to simply push past them and destroy the Empire, but of course this is not particularly logistically sound. Gilbert, Rodrigue and Matthias request reinforcements from House Charon, sending Catherine personally. Meanwhile, they opt to send a messenger to the Alliance requesting aid. He returns promising that the Alliance bears the Kingdom no ill will and will be glad to help them at Gronder. However, Matthias' spies assert that anti-Imperial sentiment in Derdriu is matched only by their hatred of the Kingdom after the events in Gloucester; it would be prudent to be wary, as it's likely Claude is planning a deception. As the Kingdom forces [move into the northern empire,](https://imgur.com/a/LIVznH9) all three armies prepare for a grand battle.

A: *Hidden Paralogue 4 - The Face Beneath.* As the Kingdom approaches the edges of the Hrym viscounty, Mercedes notices that they're traveling near the former Bartels barony. Felix, walking with her, listens with the occasional snide remark as she reminisces about her brother Emile, then stops - the Death Knight is standing before him. He whispers Mercedes' name, confirming a suspicion she had - she tells Felix she has to go speak to him, and they run after him. Felix sighs but sends a scout to warn Byleth about the Death Knight and to tell them to bring soldiers. After the fight itself, Jeritza and Mercedes have the same chat they do in the current iteration, then Jeritza leaves her with the Rafail Gem.

B: *To War at Gronder.* After a brief discussion with the Kingdom, the iconic cutscene plays to start this battle. As the battle begins, Edelgard mentions her goal of creating chaotic warfare - but Claude notes that the Kingdom isn't letting the Alliance box them in, and reluctantly notes that they'll need a full frontal assault - though he cautions Hilda and Lysithea, both of whom are with him, to be careful and let the Kingdom and Empire exhaust one another as much as possible.

As the battle continues, the Alliance calls in [mercenary allies](https://imgur.com/a/sq1zc15) - Leonie and several generics if Shez was recruited. If Shez wasn't recruited, it's Berling, Getz, Lazley and two Pegasus Knights in the north, and Shez, Leonie and three Snipers in the east. All of Berling's Company except Shez die, to Shez's horror.

Berling, Getz and Lazley die here no matter what. Lysithea, Petra, Hilda and Hubert all retreat; Bernadetta can be recruited by [Byleth](https://imgur.com/a/DIzUyJl) or [Alois](https://imgur.com/a/bernadetta-recruitment-am-alois-R387B23) if they've reached C support; Leonie by [Byleth](https://imgur.com/a/I3lt4pB) or [Shamir](https://imgur.com/a/Mwlxxrn) with the same prerequisite. The ballista is [set aflame](https://imgur.com/a/pvrLC7H) only once both Bernadetta and Petra have been defeated. After each named commander has been defeated, the battle ends - but in a cutscene, Fleche rushes in to kill Dimitri. Byleth tries to Divine Pulse and save him, ending the cutscene - but Rodrigue, Gilbert or Matthias, whoever has the highest support level with Dimitri, steps in and takes the blow. Byleth pulses again, but can't save them. The flashback occurs, then the quintessential warm hands in the rain CG happens.

# Chapter 18: The King's Triumphant Return

After examining the state of the continent after Gronder, Dimitri comes in and apologizes to all the other Lions, as well as decreeing that they must focus on the stability of the Kingdom before furthering their invasion of the Empire. With that said, they must [march northward](https://imgur.com/a/m6558vF) to Fhirdiad, taking the eastern half of the Faerghus Dukedom back and ending Cornelia once and for all.

A: *Hidden Paralogue 5 - Raiders from the North.* Dimitri and Sylvain, along with Rodrigue and/or Matthias, have to stop an incursion from Sreng raiders, led by Leif Olegsson, who seek to capitalize on the current struggles of Faerghus to take over Gautier land.

B: *The Liberation of Fhirdiad.* In addition to Titanus, Cornelia has installed Viskam in Fhirdiad during this map. It's relatively unchanged from Three Houses as is, and after the battle ends and the celebration is underway Dimitri still speaks to Byleth the same.

# Chapter 19: Maiden of Treachery

With Fhirdiad reclaimed and the Faerghus region soundly under Blaiddyd control, it's time to turn the Kingdom's eyes on the centerpiece of Adrestia's control over western Faerghus - Arianrhod. The western lords, and especially Count Rowe, were quick to join with Edelgard. Now, it's time to strike at the [western regions](https://imgur.com/a/2tZTd31) of Faerghus and Adrestia both and soundly subdue the enemy along the Faerghus-Adrestia border.

A: *Hidden Paralogue 6 - Legend of the Lake.* As the Kingdom army passes Duval territory, Flayn mentions a curious myth about a saintly beast and a Sacred Relic. She tells Byleth, but advises them not to tell Dimitri because she doubts he would allow such a frivolous and potentially irrelevant detour.. Seteth is scandalized when he finds out, but admits that it could be good to go and speak to a certain old friend there. Dimitri and Dedue *can't be deployed in this battle.* Byleth gathers those they think should join in such an excursion only to find a giant turtle apparently blocking the way. Upon arrival, they find Linhardt (a green unit) who seems to have been curious about the same thing. If he survives the battle, he asks to join your army.

B: *Hidden Paralogue 7 - Weathervanes of Fodlan.* Among the many western lords of Mach, there's only one line tied to an Elite who turned against the royal line. Annette, the niece of the baron who leads that family, insists on stopping by to plead with him - if they fight enough that he puts up a reasonable resistance, she argues, he may turn on the Empire. After all, he never *wanted* to side with them. Gilbert appears much less in this paralogue, given he may be dead, but it's otherwise mostly unchanged and ends with Baron Dominic giving Annette Crusher.

C: *Hidden Paralogue 8 - Foreign Land and Sky.* The Empire is well and truly entrenched in Brigid; The Kingdom intends to go and see if the island nation can't be persuaded to their side. Failing that, they may be forced to put an end to the pro-Imperial dynasty and cow the nation into staying neutral. The battle layout and opening and arrival dialogues change based on whether Byleth has a B support with Petra, and she is [resistant](https://imgur.com/a/dfXohkk) to the Empire at the beginning and when [arriving;](https://imgur.com/a/KaMFbNV) or whether Byleth does not, and Petra is openly on the side of the [Empire](https://imgur.com/a/aYs1CvM) and arrives as [reinforcement](https://imgur.com/a/olfbGeF). Either way, [Byleth](https://imgur.com/a/o0VQMjc) or [Claude](https://imgur.com/a/66BRK4Q) can persuade her to join the Kingdom, if they've reached C support.

D: *The Silver Maiden.* Upon reaching Arianrhod, there's a brief discussion of its history before Ashe mentions that an old friend of his offered to leave a back gate unlocked. Questions about the friend lead Ashe to simply say he trusts him, which turns out to be correct - The Kingdom army is able to enter. The battle plays out much as it does in Azure Moon as is - however, rather than Hanneman and Manuela, Hubert is backed up by Constance and Yuri, as well as Count Rowe. Yuri can be recruited by [Byleth,](https://imgur.com/a/ejCvlRa) [Ashe](https://imgur.com/a/NaTJRSR) or [Constance](https://imgur.com/a/48aii9P) if they have at least a C support, Constance by [Byleth,](https://imgur.com/a/7rV64Lf) [Yuri](https://imgur.com/a/0FBLKO2) or [Hapi](https://imgur.com/a/cq83LTi) if they have at least a B support. Talking to either immediately turns them into a blue unit rather than making them leave the map. In addition, talking to Yuri with any character not on that list - or one of those, who doesn't have a C support with him - turns him into a [green unit.](https://imgur.com/a/ZnUJgbb) He also turns into a green unit if defeated, and during this chapter retreats if defeated by enemies rather than dying. Count Rowe dies when defeated, but surrenders if you defeat Hubert first.

After taking back Arianrhod, Byleth and Dimitri [chat with Yuri.](https://imgur.com/a/oA6rXSb) Afterwards, Yuri mentions hearing a rumor that the Archbishop was taken to Enbarr. Byleth gets a flashed warning if they or Dimitri have reached B support with Rhea: \[THIS DECISION WILL DRASTICALLY IMPACT THE STORY.\] Then, they can say ""We'll reach Enbarr soon anyway,"" or, if the support prerequisite was achieved, ""We have to find a way to rescue her."" If you say the latter, Yuri chuckles and says he was already on it, then a cutscene triggers: a hooded figure walks up to the gates of Arianrhod, escorted by a pair of assassins, as the Song of the Nabateans plays. Dimitri, Byleth, and Yuri step out, Yuri grinning, and Rhea lowers her hood, clearly worse for wear but smiling. She greets Dimitri and Byleth and embraces both of them. The cutscene ends and Rhea joins your army.

# Chapter 20: The Golden Deer's Plea

The Kingdom is independent of Adrestian influence and their army gathers to make for Gerth. However, before they can, a desperate missive comes - Claude, despite their conflicts in the past, has begged the Kingdom for aid. The Empire has sent mysterious mages to fight against Derdriu itself in one final, desperate ploy. They're close to success, too - Claude hints that they have unexpected weaponry, but doesn't give details in the letter. And so Dimitri makes his call - having the Alliance on their side in the fight against the Empire can only be a good thing, and he can't imagine Claude would risk losing to the Empire for the sake of trapping them. So the Kingdom army marches [deep into the Alliance.](https://imgur.com/a/JkrrRnA)

A: [*Hidden Paralogue 9 - The Ruins of Llium (required - Shez).*](https://imgur.com/a/pyl8SaV) Strange ruins in Hrym territory bear investigation, especially as more and more dark mages appear. Shez and Byleth go to investigate along with a few allies them only for Shez to [turn on them unexpectedly.](https://imgur.com/a/EDv3eTH) Titanus go into operation as Agarthans emerge from the ruins, and only after Shez is defeated can the Kingdom army return their friend to control of their own body. Shez explains that a man named Epimenides overtook them - but that they were able to wrest control permanently from the monster. To Dedue's suspicion, they rejoin the Kingdom army with newfound control over their powers. Completing this paralogue unlocks the Asura class for Shez.

B: [*Hidden Paralogue 10 - The Drunken Heir*](https://imgur.com/a/f9233TT)*.* Dedue and (if alive) Ashe are selling herbal remedies to help fund the army, and receive an order for ""something to sober a guy up"" in a small village in Albrecht. When they and their escort (in case of trouble) arrive, they find a brawl in progress. Any recruited Wolves are quick to recognize Balthus at the center, and Dedue is quick to jump into the fray, After you fight the assailants (who Balthus explains were mercenaries sent by his stepmother) off, he offers to join your army. After completing this paralogue during chapter 20, regardless of whether you recruited Balthus or not, there's an [extra scene](https://imgur.com/a/T2AJswy) if you didn't recruit Yuri but recruited Rhea.

C: *Hidden Paralogue 11 - Forgotten Hero.* In the wilderness of Edmund, a howl draws attention to a forest shrouded in fog. Mercedes recalls a legend of a lost hero who became a monster in the Enchanted Forest of Mircea. Upon entry, your force finds Marianne, drawn alone into the woods by a monster that soon reveals a forgotten tidbit of history. Upon completion, Marianne (with Blutgang) asks to join your army.

D: *Saving Derdriu.* If you didn't recruit Shez, you get a scene immediately before arriving at Derdriu in which Shez (controlled by Epimenides) warps in behind Duke Arundel as he's sending soldiers to demand Claude's Relics. He turns in shock and greets them as Epimenides, who responds [less favorably.](https://imgur.com/a/iUTOekb) With Epimenides in control, your arrival sees Claude, Hilda and Holst (who replaces Judith in this map) desperate for aid, as they mention that the Empire's new commander seems much more competent - even though Claude swears he hired them as a mercenary before Gronder, and mentions they seem different in more ways than one - but ultimately that doesn't matter. They need to be stopped. They replace Arundel on the map.

The map is as in AM currently; Hilda can be persuaded to your side by [Marianne](https://imgur.com/a/h3Yprv7) or [Holst;](https://imgur.com/a/OIuOKpK) Holst by [Hilda](https://imgur.com/a/uPyKJ8k) or [Balthus.](https://imgur.com/a/fztQ9WF) Epimenides dies when defeated, cursing Byleth, but Thales [retreats](https://imgur.com/a/Rfr1dXb) instead. After that, things play out very differently depending on whether or not you recruited Rhea.

First - if you didn't recruit Rhea, Claude thanks you for coming to his aid. If he's met B support with Dimitri, then you get a [brief discussion.](https://imgur.com/a/ZHjLSFa) Afterward, you get a warning - \[THIS DECISION WILL DRASTICALLY IMPACT THE STORY\]. Byleth gets two options: ""That sounds like an excellent idea,"" or, ""No. Stay in the Alliance; this fight is our own."" Choosing the first recruits Claude, prompting a CG of Claude and Dimitri shaking hands by the harbor to seal the deal; the second leaves him here as you leave on friendly terms. Either way, so long as you didn't recruit Rhea, Judith arrives a few days later to give you a bit of [extra information.](https://imgur.com/a/p2De2cg)

If you *did* recruit Rhea, though, just as you drive off the Empire, Yuri arrives with a [warning.](https://imgur.com/a/2JY1yeZ) Claude, offended, backs away in a CG (Holst and Hilda, weapons drawn, are keeping Yuri, Rhea, Dimitri and Byleth back menacingly) before grabbing his wyvern and, expressing [genuine disappointment](https://imgur.com/a/qionaJA) in Dimitri, flying off to the east. Hilda and Holst say they'll need to discuss matters with the Roundtable, but in the end return willing to join with you.

# Chapter 21: The Impregnable Fortress

After the Alliance Roundtable agrees to lend its strength to the Kingdom and Church for a final invasion of the Empire, the next target is laid out: Fort Merceus. As Dimitri, Byleth, and their new allies [march southward,](https://imgur.com/a/4N4yETI) the final battle looms closer with each step.

A: *Hidden Paralogue 12 - The Sleeping Sand Legend (Required Recruit - Claude).* While studying the lore of Fodlan, Claude comes upon records of a divine beast hiding away in the Sreng tundra. At his urging your army goes to investigate - finding a figure of legend once they do.

B: [*Hidden Paralogue 13 - Imperial Retribution (Required Recruit - Claude).*](https://imgur.com/a/imperial-retribution-vmS96IR) Claude brings Dimitri and Byleth aside, mentioning that Lysithea shared with him a secret of the Empire that may have something to do with Edelgard herself. He gives a brief outline of the experiments performed on her, then explains that he suspects there may be tension between the Empire and these mages. He mentions that Duke Aegir has some kind of connection with them, and that he's been under house arrest in Boramas for years, but whispers claim that he may be plotting a rebellion. It seems as good a time as any to investigate.

Before arriving at Boramas, however, [a scene plays.](https://imgur.com/a/M8y81g1) Claude and Dimitri follow up, with Claude insisting they need to ask Duke Aegir their questions before the Empire shuts him down. They arrive too late - Duke Aegir and his knights, along with Viscount Fenja and Viscount Menja, have spread out in the streets of Boramas. Hubert and Lysithea, along with their respective battalions, are eager to end the Duke before the Kingdom gets ahold of him; talking to Lysithea with [Claude](https://imgur.com/a/YqOQCWt) turns her to a green unit, causing Hubert to retreat. Duke Aegir's death ends the battle. Afterward, Claude laments it while Lysithea bids him good riddance, but Claude receives his [answers](https://imgur.com/a/dKGTH7z) regardless. After the battle, Lysithea joins your army.

C: [*Hidden Paralogue 14 - The Saints' Forge (Required Recruit - Rhea).*](https://imgur.com/a/t4ovv9D) As the Kingdom army enters Varley, Rhea asks whether Byleth recalls the teachings about the Saints. She explains the legends of Saint Indech, and how Saint Seiros took the Ochain Shield meant for Cichol and gave it to Wilhelm. She mentions rumors that claim a similar shield has been buried near this region, once beloved by Indech; but the region has seemingly been claimed by bandits. Meanwhile, upon arrival, the Church finds none other than Professor Hanneman chasing the very same legend; grateful for the rescue, he ends up joining your army after you finish the paralogue. Once he leaves, however, Flayn, in her excitement, reveals their identities to Byleth; Rhea explains who they are and hoe they've been hiding, and hints at Byleth being very like them before trusting them to uphold the secret and continuing on with her day.

D: *Taking Fort Merceus.* If you recruited Claude, he's able to get you in with disguises; if not, then the Alliance creates a distraction allowing the Kingdom to break into the gates. The city's defenders have matters to [discuss](https://imgur.com/a/92IudXG) beforehand, but are dedicated to stopping the assault here. Caspar and Leopold die in this battle, but Jeritza can be recruited by [Mercedes](https://imgur.com/a/T9tgdUd) if The Face Beneath was completed. The Kingdom's soldiers roll in and take control of Fort Merceus, decisively cutting a large chunk of the Empire off from its capital. The Kingdom forces easily capture the western regions with many of their lords - including Houses Hevring and Ochs - stuck behind Merceus.

# Chapter 22: Our Chosen Paths

With Fort Merceus fallen, the Kingdom, Alliance and Church are ready to gather their forces for one concluding strike against Enbarr. Everyone gears up for the final battle - but just south of Merceus, Edelgard awaits. She's responded to one final missive Dimitri sent - a plea for terms to end the war - and Dimitri marches south to discuss with her. However, they can't come to terms, and so the final battle is set. However, their discussion takes a slightly more [positive turn](https://imgur.com/a/BDs7WUz) if they've reached B support and you haven't recruited Rhea.

A: *Assault on Enbarr.* This battle plays out as in canon AM more or less; rather than Petra and Dorothea, Hubert is backed up by Manuela (Trickster) and Monica (Gremory). In addition, if you completed Imperial Retribution and Edelgard and Dimitri have reached B support, Hubert has additional combat dialogue with [Claude.](https://imgur.com/a/VSwmUlD) He also [retreats](https://imgur.com/a/WzxttSJ) when defeated rather than dying. A commotion comes from the palace, and a cutscene plays; Thales says to Edelgard that her time is up, the Kingdom is here, and now she'll release her true power as their salvation. He raises a Crest stone with a wicked grin, but just as Edelgard begins to transform, an orb of ward magic appears around it. Count Hevring appears behind Edelgard, collapsing the Ward, and Edelgard, as the Hegemon, speaks - ""Call in the soldiers from the streets! Let the invaders fight against the darkness that infests Enbarr until none are left who oppose us!"" Thales, growling that Edelgard will regret taking this power without accepting its cost, backs away, Agarthan mages forming ranks around him.

# Chapter 23: Oath of the Dagger

The Imperial soldiers begin retreating from the streets into the palace - but not as though defending from an invasion. If Yuri or Claude (in that order) was recruited, they surmise that some faction has struck at the Emperor in response to the loss. If Lysithea was recruited, she has a guess on who it is. Regardless, the battle won't be over until the Emperor is defeated.

A: [*Confrontation at the Palace.*](https://imgur.com/a/RKgijg2) When you arrive, the Agarthans and Adrestians are locked in a bitter struggle. As you fight your way past various commanders on each side, pushing towards Edelgard, you *almost certainly* face Thales first. Once you defeat Thales, there's a brief cutscene of him collapsing, cursing the beasts in sheer shock, before a pan over the central room, showing the Agarthans all warping away. The Imperial soldiers then steel themselves, ready to fight to the death. If Hubert survived the streets, he appears in place of the first reinforcement in the space labeled Y on the map; he falls to one knee in his space if defeated here.

On the off chance you defeat Edelgard before Thales via bizarre paths/warp strategies/some other method, she falls to her knees on the map but doesn't disappear. The Thales defeat cutscene triggers as normal, but immediately after the end cutscene triggers. There are two different possible end cutscenes, though each is the same up until Edelgard reaches for the dagger. If Edelgard and Dimitri aren't at B rank, or if you recruited Rhea, the scene ends as normal. If they have reached B rank and you didn't recruit Rhea, however, Edelgard lays the dagger at his feet instead of throwing it, then with a moment's reluctance takes his hand. To her surprise, Dimitri pulls her into a hug, and Byleth smiles to themselves and walks out the door with a glance back before the cutscene ends.

The ending text crawl is extraordinarily different, as Dimitri *does not* unite Fodlan, and Rhea, rather than imprisoned and weak, is either at full strength or dead. The text follows:

*A rising flame was alight as the flow of time carved a new history for Fodlan. The war begun by Emperor Edelgard ended with her defeat at the Imperial Capital. After five and a half years of bloodshed, a new age was set to begin. The Empire, shamed and subdued, negotiated concessions with the Kingdom and Alliance to atone for their losses in the war. Prince Dimitri formally ascended the throne, beginning his reign as the king of the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus. Texts from the time assert that the three nations, though their relationship began shakily in the immediate aftermath, were united in the goal of ending the oppression throughout the continent that had sparked such a bloody event.*

If Edelgard survived, she gets an [ending card,](https://imgur.com/a/ip4cH6e) and if Hubert survived he shares it with her.

**Mouse Capone's Expeditions & Misadventures**     
**presents**     
### **THE TRAIL OF THE CURSE OF THE PHARAOH'S MASK**     
     
### **Chapter 1: Ink and Smoke**     
     
There’s a saying somewhere in the winding alleyways of the mind that goes something like, “If you want to catch smoke, you’d better have a good pair of lungs and a damn fine plan.” In this case, the plan involved an ink production house in Japan, a scholar with more ideas than sense, and a small-time rodent with a penchant for trouble.

**INT. INK PRODUCTION HOUSE – DAY**

The place smelled of the kind of artistry that only comes with generations of failing until you get it right. The air was thick with the rich scent of pressed mulberry paper, hot charcoal, and that unmistakable tang of patience. The artisans worked with monk-like precision, their hands moving in small, disciplined circles as they ground ink sticks on smooth stone slabs. Their movements were rhythmical, almost hypnotic, like a jazz drummer who’d decided to spend a few years contemplating the finer points of minimalist sculpture.

**PROFESSOR FEATHERSTONE** stood at the heart of it all, a thin man whose suit seemed like an afterthought. His eyes gleamed behind round spectacles as he watched the ink-making process with an intensity that bordered on religious. He had the kind of face that suggested he’d spent more time with books than with people, which was probably true if the books had anything to say about it. Next to him, **MOUSE CAPONE** looked like a small, furry afterthought in a room of forgotten stories. He was leaning against a wooden pillar, arms crossed, one ear slightly askew as if it were perpetually listening to a distant echo.

“See, Mouse, it’s all about catching the essence,” Featherstone mused, lifting his hand to let a wisp of smoke curl around his fingers. “When they burn the pine wood, it releases this vapor, and that’s what becomes the ink. But you see, the real art isn’t in the burning—it’s in knowing when to cup your hands just right.” His voice had the kind of theatricality that could only be acquired through years of lecturing to students who were already half asleep.

Mouse smirked, more out of habit than anything else. “Sounds like a lotta trouble for something you can’t hold onto, Prof,” he said. His eyes, sharp and always moving, scanned the room, clocking exits, entrances, and potential threats in that unconscious way of someone who’d made a life of dancing on the knife’s edge.

Featherstone chuckled, his laughter a thin, dry sound like paper rustling. “Ah, but that’s where the beauty lies, my friend. Wisdom, inspiration, even treasure—the world’s finest are found not in the taking, but in the balance. Too much, and it slips away. Too little, and you never had it to begin with.”

Mouse shifted his weight, his gaze narrowing. “Yeah, well, speakin’ of treasure, I been hearin’ some whispers ‘bout a Pharaoh’s tomb that’s got folks a bit jittery. You think there’s any truth to those stories?”

Featherstone turned, his eyes twinkling with a dangerous kind of curiosity. “Truth or not, it’s what people believe that drives them. There’s talk of relics, curses, and a mask that’s said to have been worn by the Pharaoh’s most trusted guard. A mask that’s supposed to show the wearer’s true intentions. Whether it’s real or not... that’s up to us to find out.”

Mouse’s whiskers twitched. He wasn’t much for curses, but he knew a good adventure when he saw one. “So where’s this trail start, Prof? And don’t tell me it’s anywhere civilized.”

Featherstone’s smile broadened. “The Rio Grande, my boy. A vast and wild place, where whispers of gold and ancient relics intermingle. But remember—”

“Yeah, yeah,” Mouse cut him off, waving a paw. “Keep my wits about me, like ink on paper. I got it.”

Featherstone nodded approvingly. “Good. Because once a line is drawn, it cannot be undone.”

Mouse didn’t like the way the words hung in the air. They felt heavy, like a raincloud just waiting for the right moment to break. But there was no sense in fretting over weather he hadn’t seen yet. His crew would be waiting outside, and knowing Minx, she’d already have the getaway plans sorted three times over.

**CUT TO:**

**EXT. INK PRODUCTION HOUSE COURTYARD – MOMENTS LATER**

The courtyard was a study in quiet contrast—stone paths leading through a garden where cherry blossoms fluttered down like pink confetti. **MINX**, with her tail swishing lazily, was leaning against a low stone wall, her eyes half-lidded in that way she did when she was both bored and thinking five steps ahead. **BLUE PUPPY** was inspecting a bamboo shoot with a look of intense concentration, as if it might reveal some cosmic secret if stared at long enough.

“Boss,” Minx said without looking up, “the horses are ready. I made sure they were sturdy enough to outrun any unwanted guests.”

“Good thinkin’,” Mouse replied, hopping down from the steps. “We’re headed to the Rio Grande. Featherstone’s got a lead on some buried treasure, maybe even a Pharaoh’s mask or two.”

Minx raised an eyebrow. “Sounds like another one of the Prof’s wild goose chases. You sure it’s worth it?”

Mouse grinned, the kind of grin that usually meant trouble for someone else. “Ain’t about the goose, Minx. It’s about the feathers you pluck along the way.”

Blue Puppy looked up from the bamboo shoot, his eyes wide. “Does this mean we’re going back to desert country? Last time we were there, the sand got places sand should never go.”

Minx rolled her eyes. “And whose fault was that?”

Blue Puppy shrugged. “Sable’s. Or was it that merchant in Marrakesh? It’s all a blur of sandstorms and bad decisions.”

Mouse waved a paw dismissively. “Doesn’t matter. What matters is we got a trail to follow and some ink to catch. Now let’s move.”

They saddled up, the horses snorting and pawing at the ground, sensing the adventure ahead. Mouse glanced back at the ink house, the smoke still curling lazily into the sky. He had a feeling that smoke was going to be with them for a while.

As they rode out of the courtyard, the air was filled with the scent of cherry blossoms and the distant echoes of a flute playing a lonely tune. It was the kind of day that felt like a beginning, and Mouse had learned to trust those feelings. They were the ones that always led somewhere interesting—sometimes to treasure, sometimes to trouble, but always somewhere worth going.

And with that, they headed into the unknown, the trail stretching out before them like a line of ink on a blank page.

**FADE OUT.**

1f5rm0q,93,2024-08-31,what life could've been without chatgpt... ,u/Brave_Elk_7062,PinoyProgrammer,https://www.reddit.com/r/PinoyProgrammer/comments/1f5rm0q/what_life_couldve_been_without_chatgpt/,"Hello. This is probably me, self-sabotaging myself but I recently got flat uno in my programming subject -- it's about angular. Then, the dev project I lead just got the highest score out of our class. I was even invited by my instructor to become one of the panelists for the projects ng tinuturuan nya sa ibang school. It was really big achievements for me -- especially I consider myself as an average IT student, I'm not the type who really does excel in class, but if efforts ang usapan, I always try give it my all.

And here's the thing. Lahat ng mga projects na nagawa ko so far, lahat 'yon ginamitan ng chatGPT. If I were to be asked na ipaulit sakin 'yun without using AI, I'm afraid na hindi ko magawa or if ever, sobrang bagal. 'Yung mga coding exercises namin sa school, na from the scratch pinapagawa, madalas I get zero out of it. If I were to be asked nga siguro sa simpleng CRUD lang from the scratch without AI and all, I can't deny the possibility na hindi ko magawa 'yun, when in fact I already went beyond simple CRUD, pero 'yun nga lang, may help ni GPT.

But I have no choice. I feel like the learning process is being compromised kasi imagine learning a framework in the span of 3-4 months ++ we have other subs pa. As much as we want to learn every bits of code na niccopypaste from GPT, baka tapos na 'yung deadline ng project, hindi pa rin tapos sa pagccode. 

Kaya sobrang hanga ko talaga sa mga senior developers, na iniisip ko paano nila nacode 'yung mga capstones nila before, eh wala pang chatgpt non? Kaya whenever tinuturuan kami ng mga profs and they code in front of us, sobrang nakakabilib lang. 

These AI tools are really helpful, but at end of the day, it invalidates the way i feel about my achievements.

1f5w05f,2,2024-08-31,Fan concept for a potential Netflix show set in the Detroit universe (came up with this for fun),u/Hero-Firefighter-24,DetroitBecomeHuman,https://www.reddit.com/r/DetroitBecomeHuman/comments/1f5w05f/fan_concept_for_a_potential_netflix_show_set_in/,"As someone who played DBH, loves this game VERY MUCH, and has read the Tokyo Stories manga, I would be lying if I said I wouldn’t buy any sequel for this game in the blink of an eye. But you know what I would like as much if not even more? Other media set in the same universe as DBH. So, this is my attempt at making a concept for a Detroit spin-off series that should air on Netflix (and possibly Amazon Prime). Note that I’m not a filmmaker and that I just made this concept up for fun (though I would be very happy if an actual filmmaker came across my idea and turned it into an actual show). I discussed this idea with ChatGPT, and I gave him everything I came up with while also giving me ideas of his own, which was a very fun thing to do. Without further ado, here is my concept:
Basic plot:
The show I’m envisioning is set in Miami during the events of DBH. Although the focus is not necessarily on androids and their fight for freedom, the show does include major android characters alongside human ones. The story of the series is very dark as it centers on a serial killer which terrorizes Miami. To twist the knife further, the main character is non-other than the serial killer himself. It is non-other than Sergeant Ethan Parker, a sergeant in the Miami Police Department and the true identity of the Butcher of Miami, the serial killer the show is about. The goal of the series is not just to show Ethan’s crimes, the consequences it has on the victims and how he maintains his facade in daily life, but also to explore deeply his psychology, which is explained by a dark past.
Profile for the main character:
Name: Ethan Parker (portrayed by Jake Gyllenhaal)
Ethan Parker was born on April 22, 2004 (thus making him 34 in 2038 when the series take place) in very difficult conditions. His father was a jobless alcoholic who found a strange sense of joy in beating him, and his childhood was one of constant physical abuse. Ethan’s high school years were no better: a group of 4 students made a point of bullying him for his red-green colorblindness. And before you say things like “he should have told someone about it”, this is something he would have done if the circumstances allowed it. As a matter of fact, teenage Ethan was powerless to report the bullying as the main bully was dating the homeroom teacher (the bully and the teacher are happily married by 2038). When Ethan reached the age of 20, he joined the Miami Police Department, and quickly rose through the ranks, to the point where he became the youngest sergeant in the Miami PD in the year 2036. Despite this impressive professional record, his career was marred by incidents of police brutality, for which he never faced any sanctions whatsoever. As for his killing spree, it all began in early May 2038 when he killed a high school girl named Isabel Vega. All of his victims are women between their teens and their early 40s.
Other characters:
Lisa Carter (portrayed by Monica Raymund): A police detective in her late 20s who is Ethan’s partner in the police. She is unaware that she is working alongside the very serial killer she’s hunting, and her detective skills make her the perfect antagonist for a creepy villain protagonist like Ethan. Her character is given even more depth through her relationship with her aging mother and her relationship with her fiancé, who is a high school librarian.
Dr. Michael Bennett (portrayed by Johnny Depp): A criminal psychologist who is charged with profiling the Butcher. He often interacts with Ethan, and suspects him of being the Butcher.
Margaret Dawson (portrayed by Diane Keaton): Ethan’s elderly neighbor, who is a retired school nurse in her late 70s and is reputed to be sharp and observant. Although she doesn’t know Ethan is the Butcher, she does have her suspicions, especially as she noticed strange patterns in his behavior.
Grace (portrayed by Angelina Jolie): A female AP700 android who is Margaret Dawson’s caretaker. She shares her owner’s suspicions about Ethan, so she starts her own investigation.
Gloria Vega (portrayed by Eva Mendez): The mother of Isabel Vega, whose interactions with the families of other victims add an emotional layer to the story of the series.
Henry Walter (portrayed by Joseph Fiennes: The husband of Emma Walter, another one of the Butcher’s victims. He loved his wife like no one else ever could, and was completely destroyed when she died, to the point he actually contemplated suicide. As the investigation shows little to no progress, he decides to seek closure in a much more effective way: revenge. Henry’s quest for revenge makes him and Ethan archenemies, and their rivalry is a key part of the show’s story.
Samantha Parker (portrayed by Elisabeth Moss): Ethan’s estranged wife, who fled his house to escape his psychological grip. She is an elementary school teacher, and her kind and compassionate nature is a stark contrast to her husband’s cruelty. At the end of the series, she divorces Ethan in prison, gets her maiden name back and moves to Texas, far away from Miami and the bad memories associated with it.
Victoria Parker (portrayed by Gal Gadot): Ethan’s younger sister. She witnessed disturbing behavior he used to have as a child, like torturing small animals, or imagining pretty dark stories with his toys. As an adult, she works as a train attendant, and she begins interacting more with Samantha following a chance encounter on a train she was working on. By the end of the series, she remains in touch with her ex-sister-in-law, and makes every effort in the world to understand her brother’s actions without trying to excuse them, and often visits him in prison.
Now, please note this is just a fan concept I made up for fun. However, if a show like that actually existed, I would watch it for sure. And what about you, would you watch it? Feel free to tell your opinion on this post. You can even add additional characters to this potential show if you want to."
