17l1h1j,1,2023-10-31,Is it realistic to learn 'Internet Programming' in 3 months ?,u/AntisocialNugget,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/17l1h1j/is_it_realistic_to_learn_internet_programming_in/,"I'm a student of Bachelor of Information Technology, currently studying the Internet Programming course. I'm currently learning in online mode.

I need advice to finish my project (It's a group project). The project that I have to do in order to complete this course  is making an e-commerce website by using HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP. The due date of the project is on 12/12/2023 which is in around 1 month from the date I'm writing this post (1/11/2023).

The reason I'm making this post is not because I'm lazy to study or lazy to write the code by myself or I want someone to write the code for me or lazy to do any kind of research or lazy to find resources or not making any progress rather I'm just confused about the situation I'm currently in.

Let me give more context about the Internet Programming course I'm studying for in this semester. According to the academic calendar, the duration of the current semester is from 11/9/2023 to 18/12/2023, that's like around 3 months. The schedule of the Internet Programming course is on every tuesday from 12/9/2023 until 12/12/2023. The duration of the class is 2 hours per week. In short, there are 14 of two-hour lecture sessions all together.

In this Internet Programming course, the students are expected to learn HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP. As weeks went by, the lecturers had thought HTML, CSS, and as of the date I'm writing this post, he had thought javascript, in yesterday's class. So far my main resource of learning is the Odin Project. You may ask, ""Why don't you just refer to the recorded online lecture sessions?"", ""Why don't you just learn from your lecturer instead?"". My answer is simply because the lecturer had just been reading slides throughout all the lecture sessions. That's why I'm struggling to learn from my lecturer. That's why I can barely learn anything from the lecture sessions although they are recorded and I can play the recorded sessions as many times as I want to like I always do with any Youtube tutorial videos.

That's why I prefer to learn from the Odin Project instead at least for the HTML, CSS and Javascript in order to finish the assigned project. As weeks went by I felt like I was doing just fine learning from the Odin Project, I like it, cause I know that I'm actually learning things. I'm currently still in the Foundation Course of the Odin Project, learning CSS. I started doing the Foundation Course of the Odin Project like around 4 weeks ago when the current semester started. Everything felt good to me until I came to a realization that I'm kinda running out of time to learn everything I need to finish the project if I'm just following the lessons structured in the Foundation Course of the Odin Project. For the long run, the Odin Project is good for me but for the time being I only have like around 1 month left to learn HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP in order to finish my project. To make things worse, I did some google search specifically for the reddit sites to find out how long do other people take to just finish the Foundation Course of the Odin Project and I found out that some people take almost a year to just finish the Foundation Course, some people take months, mostly more than three months from what I read throughout the reddit posts and comments.

Well, you guys may wonder ""The project's requirements cannot be that difficult since you only have less than three months to finish it, right?"". To be honest, I'm not sure. In the next paragraphs, I pasted the project instructions (italicised) so that you can be the judge yourself. I also forgot to mention that I'm currently in the third semester of the first year. Although I had learned some programming in the previous semester, I'm still pretty new to web programming.

*Description:*

*This assignment is about improving your web development skills by building an e-commerce website using HTML and CSS. The website should let users browse and buy products online, showcase the products, give details about them, and make shopping.*  


*Instruction:*

*Your task is to create a website using HTML and CSS. Make each section its own separate web*  
*page*

&#x200B;

* ***Home Page***
* *Create a landing page featuring highlighted products and an interactive product slideshow*  
*using JavaScript.*
* *Show product images, names, prices, and short descriptions.*
* *Include a search bar with JavaScript-driven auto-suggestions.*
* *Enable user authentication with PHP for personalized experiences.*

&#x200B;

* ***Product Categories***
* *Design a page listing various product categories with images and descriptions.*
* *Implement dynamic category filtering using JavaScript.*
* *Allow users to create accounts and save favourite categories.*

&#x200B;

* ***Product Listings***

* *Show product images, names, prices, and ratings, and implement features like image*  
*zoom on hover.*
* *Retrieve and display product data from a database using PHP.*
* *Enable user accounts for saving products to wish lists or making comparisons.*

&#x200B;

* ***Product Details***
* *Create detailed product pages with comprehensive information, including high-quality*  
*images, detailed descriptions, specs, and customer reviews.*
* *Enhance detailed product pages with JavaScript for interactive elements such as image*  
*galleries.*

* *Design a page for users to manage selected products.*
* *Display product names, quantities, prices, and a subtotal.*
* *Offer options to update quantities, remove items, and proceed to checkout.*
* *Update the shopping cart page to enable users to edit quantities and remove items with*  
*JavaScript.*
* *Manage the user's shopping cart session using PHP.*
* *Implement the checkout process, including user address and payment information.*  


Those are the instructions or the requirements of the project.

As of now, I don't know where to go from here. Should I just continue to learn from the Odin Project to complete the project? In the long run, yeah, I want to and should continue doing the Odin Project. The reason I feel doubtful right now is because even if I rushed through the Foundation Course of the Odin Project, I don't think it will be enough to complete the project due to the time, knowledge and skill restriction.

You also may ask, ""Why don't you try getting help from your coursemates?"". Well, it's because the method of learning of the Bachelor of Information Technology that I'm currently pursuing is online mode. I can barely contact any of my coursemates personally. Even if I can get in touch with them personally via email, whatsapp or through the whatsapp group of the course, they will hardly reply cause most of them are working adults, and they won't even have the time to help me. Plus, some of them are also struggling like me except the ones who have experience in programming. I also suspect that some of them just use the ChatGPT or ask other people to write the code for them to do the previous assignments/quizzes of this course (the 'people' could be their friends who are good in programming or they pay other people who are good in programming to do the previous assignments / quizzes, in Malaysia, it's actually a thing to pay someone to write the code for you or simply do the assignments for you.)

I think the last resort for me is just to use the ChatGPT to finish the project. I'm kinda in a dead end here to finish the project. What do you guys think? Should I change the way I study? Should I change the resouces of study? Am I just too slow? Should I put in more hours? Should I just use ChatGPT? Or is it relevant or realistic to learn 'Internet Programming' or in other words, is it relevant or realistics to learn HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP all together in 3 months. Mind you that I also have assignments from other courses to do obviously.

I'm sorry if this post is too long, I just need to get if off my chest. Any kind of help, tips,comments or advices are really needed and appreciated.

Thank you."
17l6a40,12,2023-11-01,$30K Revenue (9 Months): From Nothing to Launching Courses in a Day Now [Full Guide],u/ShellOfNutshell,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/17l6a40/30k_revenue_9_months_from_nothing_to_launching/,"I started creating courses in January, 2023. I had no experience prior to this creating online courses. Over the last 9 months, this has been a stable **$2k / month** for me and I want talk about my story and how I did it. Firstly, Revenue screenshot: [https://imgur.com/a/zraqWND](https://imgur.com/a/zraqWND) \- October revenue is still unaccounted for - but it's going to be **3k based on enrolments and previous trends**.

# My courses & Time taken

My first course - It was a disaster. Recorded with a laptop microphone, the 2 hour course was on a trending AI Topic, died in 2 months. Took me **3 weeks to build it**.

My second course - Master Generative AI (Extension of previous course but taught everything in AI), took me **4 weeks to build**, makes me the most amount of money, and has a lot of students

My Third course - Prompt Engineering - took me **2 weeks to build**, a lot of students, but dying after 3 months

My Fourth course - AI & SEO (recently launched) - picking up slowly, took me **2 weeks to build**

My Fifth and 6th courses are on AI Product Management & Digital Marketing and were **built in less than a week.** 

I'm launching another course in November **within a week.**

[My Profile on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/user/feelix-2/)

&#x200B;

**Notice how i went from 3 weeks to 4 days for launching courses.**

Firstly, i'm a hard believer of launching MVP and iterating over time. I don't spend all my energy building perfect courses, I build a bare bone MVP and keep adding content.

&#x200B;

# How do you get to 1 course a week, provided you decide to do this full time?

**A course has 6 stages of creation:**

\- **Ideation** \- what you want to build, mostly go with your passion and the knowledge you have curve is shorter - 10%

\- **Research** \- What kind of courses exist, which ones are top rated and why - 20%

\- **Creation** \- Recording content and creating videos / assignments / notes / cover images / texts - 35%

\- **Editing** **Content** \- 30%

\- **Initial** **launch** \- 5%

(% indicates how long each step took me initially)

&#x200B;

# Break-down of each of these steps:

\- **Ideation** \- you figure out what kind of course you want to build, this one is relatively easy but super important. You need to choose a niche that is less competitive (AI SEO is one such niche) but has decent audience for making money. It could be a electric guitar, setting up a grocery shop, so on. As long as it's not competitive, do it

&#x200B;

\- **Research** \- Once you figure what you want to build, start looking at a couple of places for inspiration and understand whether the market exists for this type of content. This could be just looking at the course marketplace to see other courses exist, Reddit posts, blogs, Groups and so on, as long as there are people looking for it, you bet you can make money

&#x200B;

\- **Creation** \- this is what takes a lot of my time. I'm going to show you how i significantly reduced my time in here.

* Curriculum - research other courses / starting from scratch is not ideal because other courses already have invested time to refine the curriculum so makes sense to use that as a starting point
   * **How to automate: Use the best rated course and use** [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) **to generate a similar course structure, add notes on additional lectures example - i teach about ""BLUE"" electric guitars, it takes almost no time to get to starting point**
* Script + Slides creation - Once you have curriculum, putting together script can be a nightmare, but this is essential. instead of building an entire script, put down bullet notes.
   * **Use ChatGPT to take each chapter and then create bullet notes to talk about - copy these notes in a doc to refer later**
   * **Leverage these bullets to create slides on Canva - takes 1 min per slide - so 40 minutes overall for a 40 Page PPT** 
* Cover Image / Description - All of this optimized content can created using ChatGPT - invest very little time here, but ensure you have keywords optimised in the course
* Course recording - This it the major heavy-lifting but you will have to do this. **I use** [**OBS**](https://obsproject.com/) **to record content, it's free and open source and gets the job done, initial learning curve is 15 minutes**

THIS is by far my most time taking part, initially, it was the editing but i automated it, let me show you how.

&#x200B;

\- **Editing -**  I'm proud to have automated this bit. But let me talk about the initial struggle first:

* Basic Edits
   * Initially I used Primere Pro to edit my videos. This step took a lot of time, even more than creating that video, because in order to make course video optimised, I would trim silent parts, which would be a night mare. 
   * Now I'm leveraging AI tools like [Snapy](https://snapy.ai) to auto edit using their video silence remover feature. It's a boon. 
   * It may come as a surprise but I spend no time editing my video. It's all ready within a few minutes. The only effort is uploading it.

\- **Initial Launch** \- Takes me literally an 30 mins to launch my course. I publish it on Marketplaces like Udemy, they take care of all the marketing, while I keep creating courses. Most of the revenue is market place based, you get 100% of the revenue coming from your own marketing links. They take a cut for their marketing based revenue.

&#x200B;

# How much time each step takes me now for a 4 hour course:

**Ideation** \- 1 hour

**Research** \- 1-2 Hours

**Creation** \- 7-8 Hours (varies on course length)

**Editing** \- 1 Hour

**Initial Launch** \- 30 minutes

I don't know who will benefit from this. But I hope I can help someone who is looking to productise their knowledge. All the best!

ChatGPT has given me some basics - any other advice?",u/Signifi-gunt,TEFL,https://www.reddit.com/r/TEFL/comments/17l8yvl/no_real_qualifications_yet_ive_been_given_a/,"For example, ChatGPT just gave me a list of 20 games/activities I can play with students mainly for pronunciation/conversational practice.

Most of the lesson material will be provided beforehand, and the center knows of my level of experience and are willing to help train me. 

All this said, I need all the advice I can get. I leave on Sunday to the Cambodian border for a new visa, and then I motorbike up the VNese coast to this small town to begin my new life. 

Any and all advice welcome. And yes, I am aware of the ethical problems that come with being an unqualified English teacher, so please spare the sermons."
17lghvs,6,2023-11-01,AITA for wanting my friend to have a harsher punishment for not contributing to team project,u/SneakySquirrel547,AITAH,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/17lghvs/aita_for_wanting_my_friend_to_have_a_harsher/,"So I am a Senior in college right now along with my friend who I've known for about 5 years now.  We are both taking computer science courses and are both in the same 'senior project' course in which students form a team and create a software project.  Obviously, as friends, we formed a group together with me being the team leader (I asked if she was fine with this and she said it was).  I had no issues with her before this.  However, a day after everyone got into their groups, I immediately regretted forming a group with her.  I was discussing with her my plan for the project and making sure she was okay with it.  She mentioned how she was fine with my idea, but warned me and said ""you'll have to program, too, cause I can't do all the work.""  At first I thought she was joking but she wasn't.  That really set me off since nobody has even gotten to starting on the project since it was the very first day, but I reacted calmly and just carried on.  Well, it kept getting worse.

The first week was arguably the easiest.  The task was simple: sign a group agreement form to do our work on time, etc.  The form is already written by the teacher and just needs everyone's signatures.  As the team leader, I am tasked with turning in this work as well as everything else (minus the code cause everyone individually turns that in).  I signed the agreement form and sent it to her online so she could sign it and send it back to me to turn in.  After sending it to her asking for her signature, she wanted me to forge her signature so I could turn it in (I waited a few days for her to actually respond back to my message about the form, and now it was due that night).  Again, I was upset at this as it seemed like such a simple damn task.  I stood firm and said ""no, I can't do all of the work!"" as both in a lighthearted way but mainly serious.  Eventually, she signed it and sent it back to me so I could turn it in a few hours before the due date.

The next week we had to make a description of what we wanted our project to do and why.  I filled out my part and shared a Google doc with her so she could put in her stuff.  She then put in her description of the project and then told me she used ChatGPT to fill it out because she ""didn't know what to write.""  I was very pissed off at this point and told her to rewrite it in her own words saying I didn't want to use ChatGPT as everyone in the class and the teacher has access to all of our work and might be able to tell it was written by an AI.  She rewrote it and I double checked that she did by throwing in the new text in an AI identifier (the original one came back around 80% AI written and the new one was only around 20% so I was satisfied with that).

Next assignment comes around and is basically where everyone makes these design documents for our project.  I asked her to help out with it and she said she would, but then never did.  I messaged her multiple times through Discord and text receiving no response until a few days after the due date.  Her excuse was her computer wasn't working and her internet was bad.  I knew this was bs cause she streams for her fans online and I can see that she was doing that while I was waiting on her to help for several days.  So I had to complete everything myself and turn it in on time the day it was due.

She continues not contributing to the project at each turn.  The next assignment was to post some ideas on what to implement in the project that a potential user would want in it.  I asked for her help and she did not turn in anything.  The teacher wanted every group to have at least 10 written down.  So I had to write all 10 cause I didn't want my project to get points deducted.

By then I was extremely pissed off and frustrated as hell.  I reached a breaking point and emailed the teacher explaining everything, but leaving out the part about how she used ChatGPT cause I didn't want her to be suspended or anything.  I just wanted her to be taken out of the project as a whole and let me do it on my own cause I work better alone.  He emailed back saying he would speak with her and if things didn't improve would do something else.

Next phase is the actual programming part.  Luckily, I guess his talk with her worked cause she wrote up the first part of the project.  I was happy about that and hoped it would get better....it didn't.  I asked her to put in different things in the project while I put in others.  She only coded one more thing in this span of 3 weeks for this phase.

At the end of this phase, everyone is supposed to present what they have done so far and give a 'demo' of the project running.  The demo was about 5 days away at the time and so I messaged her asking if she could put in her code and even mentioned exactly what lines I wanted the code on to help her know what I needed.  She ignored me for a whole day and messaged back saying she will get on it.  

A few days pass and nothing.  I message her again (2 days before the demo due date now), asking about it.  She submitted some code but it wasn't what I asked for...at all.  It wasn't even in the file we were working on.  I told her this and she didn't respond (keep in mind, she is posting for her fans online during all this so I know she sees it).

The day it's due, an hour before class starts, she messages she put in the correct code.  I checked it and it's still not right.  Has errors, etc.  I told her and at this point was just completely done.  30 minutes before we are supposed to present I just decided to code it myself so we could have what we needed.  I got it done and we presented our demo.

I decide to talk to the teacher after class alone about the situation and explain everything that's happened since the emails (again, I don't mention ChatGPT).  He tells me that if he took her out of the group now then she would ""be thrown under the bus and wouldn't pass the class and would have to retake it.""  He told me he thought the best thing to do is to keep her in the group and told me to give her things to do that don't have a severe impact on the project completion (he offered ideas like researching things, etc.).  He also said he agreed with me, though, and assured me the grade I get will not be the same as hers and that she will probably receive a bad one. This is where I'm asking whether or not IATA because I just don't like how she is still going to be in the project and pass still without helping hardly at all.  Like yeah she will pass with a bad grade, but I feel like that's too generous.  I don't want her to be attached to the project at all and essentially leech off of me to barely pass.  I just don't feel like it's very fair."

Though with different needs we are three people at home (family binded) that would use the ChatGPT Plus service to “work"" with it.

One for student needs, other for research & professional texts, last one to help with language learning.

Not usually at the same time, and not with a really continuous and intense use.

So… my questions are:  
• is it admissible to share an account, is it limited to different devices or IPs, or just to the number of “queries” per hour?

• have you experienced this kind of scenario, and which do you think are the pros/cons vs. paying several accounts or combining with the free 3.5 chat?

As I say, it’s not a continuous use for any of us three, but we would like to use the Plus version to start trying “the good stuff” and trust each other not to delete or mess with our chats or so (by now).

Thank you all in advance!!

Optimize Your Job Search with AI: Creating a Targeted Resume with ChatGPT"")

Are you struggling to create a resume that grabs the attention of potential employers? In today's competitive job market, it's crucial to tailor your resume to each job application. But how do you craft a resume that aligns perfectly with the job description? The answer lies in utilizing the power of ChatGPT, a versatile AI tool that can make this process seamless.

[Companies use applicant tracking systems \(ATS\) to screen resumes by keywords](https://preview.redd.it/uvvss0mbysxb1.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=f19986f00f49424ceaf4170d4431af69526d7ad2)

**Understanding the Challenge: Why Tailored Resumes Matter**

Before we look into the magic of ChatGPT, let's understand the importance of crafting tailored resumes. When you submit a generic resume for every job application, you miss the opportunity to highlight the specific skills and experiences that make you the perfect candidate for that particular role.

Employers use applicant tracking systems (ATS) to screen resumes. These systems **look for keywords and phrases that match the job description**. If your resume lacks these keywords, it might not even make it to the hiring manager's desk.

**Introducing ChatGPT: Your Resume Writing Assistant**

ChatGPT is an AI-based tool that leverages natural language processing (NLP) to understand what you need to write. It can suggest words and sentences to help you complete your writing task effectively. But how can ChatGPT assist you in creating **a tailored resume**?  


https://i.redd.it/4nhbfjz9zsxb1.gif

**Step 1: Setting Up ChatGPT**

The first step is to access ChatGPT. You can easily set up your account on the CareerSpark platform, a specialized AI content generation platform designed for early-career job seekers and university students. With CareerSpark, you have a user-friendly interface that streamlines the process.  


https://preview.redd.it/oa3czz5nysxb1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6256fb16bcc64f52e04b89d1a0d19816db00b91

**Step 2: Providing a Clear Prompt**

Once you're in, tell ChatGPT that you need to create a tailored resume. The more specific you are, the better. You can even provide some basic information about the job you're applying for and what you want to emphasize in your resume.

&#x200B;

[Steps to make your resume shine!](https://preview.redd.it/ltfdwm5pysxb1.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=dbeb5c48c9fc1bf1c9a62fe08accb5ae76284b79)

**Step 3: Including Your Background**

Now, share a little more about yourself with ChatGPT. Provide your name, contact information, professional experience, education, skills, and qualifications. ChatGPT will use this information to personalize your resume.

&#x200B;

[Let yourself stand out among TONS of candidates](https://preview.redd.it/1lf2xvlsysxb1.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=4fdbd4a900cd48fe53374398404c906163e8cf9e)

**Step 4: Inputting Job Description**

This is where the magic begins. Paste the job description for the position you're interested in. ChatGPT will use this information to **pick up matching skills and experiences** from your background information to generate a resume that **aligns with the job requirements and the ATS system**.

&#x200B;

[There are no good resumes, just matching ones!](https://preview.redd.it/8fuqwyruysxb1.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=df8f413e0b94f5a32f29c5137624e6700efdac34)

**Step 5: Crafting the Perfect Resume**

Once you've provided all the necessary inputs, ChatGPT takes over. It generates a draft resume that is not only keyword-rich but also tailored to the specific job description. The result is a resume that stands out in the eyes of employers and the ATS.

**Step 6: Fine-Tuning Your Resume**

While ChatGPT is an incredible tool for creating a first draft, it's essential to review and fine-tune your resume to ensure it reflects your unique skills, experiences, and personality. Personalization sets you apart from the competition, and it's a critical aspect of the job application process.

**ATS-Friendly Resume Tips:**

* Use standard fonts like Arial, Calibri, or Times New Roman to ensure readability
* Include relevant keywords from the job description to improve the chances of passing through applicant tracking systems
* Optimize headings and subheadings using simple formatting (e.g., bold or capitalized) to enhance scanability
* Avoid using images, graphics, or tables that may not be compatible with ATS

Whether you choose to do it manually with ChatGPT or automate the process with [CareerSpark](https://careerspark.io/), remember that a personalized resume can make all the difference in your job search.

**CareerSpark: A Specialized Platform to Tailor Your Resume**

[CareerSpark](https://careerspark.io/) makes the process even easier. It automates many of the steps we've discussed. It incorporates your resume, the job description, and your inputs to generate a highly personalized resume with just one click.

17lo53d,1,2023-11-01,Advice Needed: Next Steps in Tech Stack,u/marioagario123,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/17lo53d/advice_needed_next_steps_in_tech_stack/,"About me:  
I am a masters student who will be graduating in May of 2024. I want to be fully ready, by Feb, to apply for entry-level/experienced roles by learning the right tech stack along with leetcoding.

What does my profile look like now?  
I have prior work ex at a big name company as a DevOps Engineer where I used AWS, Terraform, gitlab-ci. I just finished a project - a simple app and used the tech stack: React (basics, with help from chatGPT, Flask, Docker, AWS ECR, EKS, Terraform, gitlab-ci. I just got my AWS solutions architect associate certificate.

The issue:  
I don't know if just knowing DevOps tools is enough. My peers know things like backend/frontend/full-stack and also what I know: AWS, Dockers, Kubernetes(basics) etc. I feel like I don't know enough and I know only a subset of what others know (are other inflating what they know? I for sure did waste a lot of time not learning).  I aspire to climb the DevOps ladder and into a Solutions Architect. 

Advice that I need:   
I will keep leetcoding for the next three months but also want to add to my tech stack. Which of the following should I do?  
1) Should I continue getting breadth in DevOps and learn other things like Jenkins, master Kubernetes etc.  
2) Should I get a T-shaped knowledge on software engineer with the depth being in Devops? Should I learn a little bit of full stack, backend, DBA kind of work?   
3) Should I learn MLOps or something that I haven't mentioned above?   


Looking forward to a doing a project in whatever I conclude from your replies. Thanks for reading."

Tomorrow, I have a meeting with my academic advisor to discuss my progress in searching for an HR internship for next Summer. I haven't applied to a single job yet, I haven't even attended a single social event nor taken the weekend to party or visit a bar. 

I started my master's degree in HR this past August. My bachelor's degree was in business administration. Higher education was not favored and highly discouraged due to my religion, which I became inactive 6 years ago. My parents cried and cut me off the day that they found out that I was attending community college. I was in a religion that had the lowest education rate in the United States. I wasn't intellectually smart. After getting my bachelor's degree, I moved to New York and took entry-level jobs. I became a Recruiter Coordinator and kept staying in the same role for 3+ years. 

I decided to get my master's in HR at Cornell University. I realized that AI is in popular demand. With ChatGPT coming out, in my gut instinct, it tells me to be prepared for the next ""tech wave"" technical skills will be highly valuable. Now, I'm enrolled in undergrad computer science courses--starting with the basics. You can go into the ""higher material course"" without the basics. 

Yesterday, I was told that it is pretty badass to be learning programming as an HR graduate student. **How hard on a scale of 1-10 (10 being the best) is it for someone with my background to learn programming?** I received a huge amount of pushback before going into CS. My professors tell me that graduate students without a CS background shouldn't be allowed to enroll in CS. 

I realized two weeks in that the same learning style and mindset was different when doing CS student work compared to my student work in HR. Adapting was hard and I'm still adapting my learning style. I hope people know that when they say that I'm a badass, that what I've got through has never been easy. I hope it pays off. When I say work, I mean studying in this context. What people don't see, when they seem intrigued based on my technical knowledge so far: 

\-- weekly all-nighters (working 32 - 38 hours none stop)

\-- the hours in fixing and debugging my code for very basic errors 

\-- crying myself to sleep when I receive a bad grade 

\-- the constant ""unmotivating comments"" like ""Why are you putting yourself through hell?"" ""Graduate HR students don't go into CS"" ""Stay out of CS"" ""That's not for you, you weren't born with that talent""

\-- studying all weekends and during class breaks 

I hope people know that there's no shortcuts. Now, it is finally coming together, where I can have and hold conversations around CS. Where I'm asking better questions, where I know what tools and how to use them to debug my code faster. The conversations with experienced HR professionals, where they seem impressed. 

I don't know how to best describe this, but my thinking/my mind can now connect aspects of CS, Business, and HR knowledge, leading to more insightful and through-provoking comments. For the first time last Tuesday, I realized that when I commented in class everyone became very quiet and after my comment, my professor even smiled-- he never smiles. 

How difficult is it for someone to be turned into a programmer with 0 CS knowledge to start with? 

Is it going to keep being hard? 

Is the worse part over? 

Is it going to be worth it at the end?

Is my IQ increasing?

This isn't easy, it is brutally hard. I visited MIT this past Monday because I was interested in networking and hopefully becoming inspired. Thank you for reading! I know that it's a long post. "

17m0us8,1,2023-11-02,Using Material 3 for 'creative concepts',u/LakemX,UXDesign,https://www.reddit.com/r/UXDesign/comments/17m0us8/using_material_3_for_creative_concepts/,"Hi,

I am a UX design student currently graduating at my internship. Even though I am a student I am mostly self thought. My school doesn't do presentations or workshops a lot. If you have questions they can give you feedback and share their opinions but specifics on how to do what, is not something they can or are willing to provide.

I am struggling to use material design. I always thought I did pretty well back in material 2. With using pre build components and It looked 'professional'. However nowadays the products I make are very experimental and out of the box. Nothing like a website/webstore for selling clothing or a blog website. 

I do research into a problem and come up with out of the box concepts and work them out in a design in figma. That's where I collide with material design. I think it's great that there are loads of principles and thoughts put into it. But I struggle to apply those to my work. So I have a few questions I would like to ask you guys!

1. How do you learn material design? Do you read all the documentation? Or follow a course? Do you use chatgpt? I struggle to learn the basics because there is so much and it's a bit overwhelming.

2. When do you use material design and in what capacity? Do you use it as a template/basics and than add your own elements to spice things up? Do you strictly follow their guidelines and don't use anything you come up with on your own? I could use some advice here.

3. Do you use their kits for something like figma?


As I said I am struggling a bit. With my current project I am applying gamification to my designs which I am pretty sure material doesnt have a component for. And even if they had I am not sure where to start, and how to apply it correctly.

Tldr: I am struggling to apply material design 3 correctly. And generally don't know how to use a design system when making something non-standard/out of the box/wacky/experimental.

Any advice is much appreciated! I am still learning so if I sound dumb/ignorant please forgive me :)"
17m43r1,67,2023-11-02,Am I crazy to want to leave?,u/StructureFair5679,TeachersInTransition,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeachersInTransition/comments/17m43r1/am_i_crazy_to_want_to_leave/,"I have been told by other teachers that I have it made, but I am still considering leaving the profession. Am I crazy?

I have two plan periods during the day that never need to be filled with meetings or class covers. I get to teach the classes that I like to upperclassmen, and I only have two preps. My administration is super supportive, and parents are great within our school community. I only work my contract hours, and the breaks are amazing. 

Here is the issue - students do not care about being in school or being a student, for that matter. The amount of apathy is off the charts. Many days it really feels like I am talking to a wall, regardless of the engagement level of the lesson. I've really noticed this over the past few years, especially. There has been a major increase in student referrals, and it seems like things are reaching a boiling point. I have caught at least 20 students so far this year using ChatGPT to write their papers, and it is being excused by administration to meet our goal of increasing our graduation rate and decreasing suspensions. Honestly, it is making me feel incredibly detached and bored from a profession that I used to love. 

I'm wondering, should I stick it out and hope things improve? Or is this a sign that when even the teachers in a ""good"" position are wanting to leave, that things have gone terribly wrong?"

In the world of cricket, few names shine as brightly as Virat Kohli. His journey from a young Delhi boy to the captain of the Indian cricket team has been nothing short of spectacular. With remarkable skills, an unyielding passion for the game, and an unquenchable thirst for victory, Virat Kohli has carved his name in the annals of cricketing history. Join us in this exploration of the life and career of Virat Kohli, the man who redefined the sport.

**Early Life and Cricketing Beginnings of Virat Kohli**

Virat Kohli, born on November 5, 1988, in Delhi, India, was destined for greatness from a young age. His father, Prem Kohli, worked as a criminal lawyer, and his mother, Saroj Kohli, was a housewife. Virat grew up in a middle-class family, and his love for cricket was evident from the moment he could hold a bat. Little did anyone know that the young boy playing cricket on the streets of Delhi would one day become a cricketing legend.

Virat's initial cricketing education took place at the West Delhi Cricket Academy. Under the watchful eye of coach Rajkumar Sharma, he honed his skills and displayed extraordinary talent that belied his age. As he progressed through the ranks, Virat Kohli's commitment to the game became more apparent with each match he played. His performances in age-group cricket were nothing short of extraordinary, foreshadowing the greatness that lay ahead.

**Rise to Prominence in Domestic Cricket**

Virat Kohli's journey to cricketing stardom began in earnest in the realm of domestic cricket. He made his First-Class debut for Delhi in the 2006-07 Ranji Trophy and soon became a vital part of the team. His remarkable consistency and an insatiable appetite for runs caught the eye of selectors, and it wasn't long before he earned his place in the India Under-19 team.

It was during the ICC Under-19 World Cup in 2008 that Virat Kohli's talent truly shone. He led the Indian team to victory, scoring centuries and amassing over 200 runs in the final. This performance was a testament to his leadership skills and his ability to thrive under pressure, qualities that would later define his career in the senior national team.

**Virat Kohli's ODI Debut and Rapid Ascent**

Virat's One Day International (ODI) debut for India came in August 2008 against Sri Lanka, a moment that marked the beginning of a glorious international career.

I'm in my first quarter and I'm feeling miserable. I'm trying to pivot to something very niche, which is why I need a master's degree but that restricts me to a handful of opportunities where I'm completely outmatched in terms of skills and expertise. The courses feel tough as the quarter system dumps loads of new content and quizzes and assignments. I'm trying to do my best, yet somehow I feel I'm not doing anything. I came for a Master's to gain knowledge, but now it seems like the quarter is just passing by as I try to submit one assignment after another using ChatGPT. 

I have used a big chunk of my education loan, and probably won't be able to make next month's rent. Haven't been able to get in a lab or get a TA/grader position yet. And lol don't even want to think about internships, even though that might be the most important part of my Master's as eventually nothing really matters if I don't get a job. Is this normal? Should I just keep my head down and grind more? Is there an end to this suffering? I'm all up to take on challenging research and coursework, that's why I'm here. But coursework coupled with financial stress, finding internships and RA position is killing me from within.

This is just a rant, trying to vent and feel better. I know people might suggest taking up a part time job or something, and believe me I would love to. But I'm finding it difficult to extract the most of my coursework itself, let alone doing something on top of that."

I get it, Anki is powerful and all... but definitely not as user friendly as quizzlet IMO. 

All my list are stored in excel spreadsheets and are sorted in tabs.

I want to import those tabs on anki.

(i'm learning japanese)

the excel tabs looks like this :

A:A the kanji

B:B Onyomi

C:C Kunyomi

D:D translation.

I was thinking that I could just copy paste the list but either on the desktop app or the web extension I just can't find anything, the app only allows me to create card by card or to import csv files. csv is an option but I don't want to spend 4 hours converting my 100+ excel files.

sorry for comparing with an other app but, on quizzlet I could just copy paste my excel tabs on a text area and it would auto detect the cards I want to create, is there a similar feature on Anki ? or by using chatGPT to create a similar algorithm for card creation ?

Sorry again for my silly request, I'm trying my best to learn Anki to take a further steps in my learning and maybe in the future by sharing decks with my students.

If you have any tips to convert quizzlet list to anki list I would be very happy to learn how to do it.

thank you in advance for your answer,

hope I will be an Anki pro soon !

17myacu,1,2023-11-03,What type of MBA for doctorate student,u/theobrominepoisoning,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/17myacu/what_type_of_mba_for_doctorate_student/,"Hi!

TL;DR: Doctorate student in nutritional Science with previous biomedical project management experience considering an MBA for a career shift into management. Seeking advice on affordable, reputable (online) MBAs that offer flexibility during/post-PhD. 

Long version:

I've been screening the other posts but maybe you can give me some more advice..

I am a biomedical scientist that is currently doing nutritional studies and I plan to get my doctorate in approx. 2 years max. I have some work experience (both governmental and pharma), mostly in project management/ project lead. I am passionate for science but fed up with research, given the ridiculously bad working conditions. At the same time, I have a business driven mindset and I see my future self either in a (corporate) management position or some current start-up ideas will end up being successful. I'd be happy to benefit my biomedical background in some future management positions.

I am 30 years old and I am not fully sure whether I would really want to spend another 1- 2 years on a full time MBA program after receiving my PhD, but I would definitely consider that as an option if career prospects are much better (based on my readings: pro: better network and much more financially attractive positions, con: time and costs) and if it was not overly expensive. 

I see an MBA as a toolkit and I might not need the full skillset of a traditional MBA. 

 ChatGPT gives me a bunch MBA options

Full-Time MBA
Part-Time MBA
Executive MBA (EMBA)
Online MBA
Global MBA
Accelerated MBA
Professional MBA (PMBA)


I want to learn the necessary skills and I believe that I have already a network of people that might have some suitable job offers. 

Do you have any suggestions? Maybe some affordable but internationally acknowledged online program would already improve my career prospects? 

Thanks in advance!"

https://preview.redd.it/lks6gpdss5yb1.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=93bad33ae4b7b20998dd03df6e5273a08975e484

Hi folks,

My name is Ariel, I come here every once in a while and give away free coupons for my courses. I do this because when I started with Node.js, this subreddit was an incredible resource for me. I've used the knowledge gained here and produced three courses, helping almost 200k developers learn stuff - AWS, NestJS and more. It brings me joy to give back to the community.

I recently published a new course - **AI For JavaScript Developers (OpenAI, Embeddings, Vercel AI)**. For now, it's quite short - 2.5 hours long. Here's a rough idea of the content:

* Understanding Gen. AI and LLMs versus traditional AI, and the immense opportunity for us developers
* Anatomy of an API call to OpenAI
* Prompt engineering techniques for accurate results and preventing hallucinations
* Fetching real-time data using OpenAI Function Calling
* Using LlamaIndex and Vector Stores to store huge pieces of data and using RAG to inject context
* Building the back-end for a real ""Chat with your PDF""  app (Next.js front-end is provided), applying all of these techinques.

**TLDR - Coupons are valid for 5 days. Once you claim it, it's yours forever. Please let me know what you think once you start with the course!**

||Coupon Code|Link|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Coupon #1 (1000 redemptions)|FREE\_FOR\_REDDIT\_1|[Direct link with coupon applied](https://www.udemy.com/course/ai-for-js-devs/?couponCode=FREE_FOR_REDDIT_1)|
|Coupon #2 (1000 redemptions)|FREE\_FOR\_REDDIT\_2|[Direct link with coupon applied](https://www.udemy.com/course/ai-for-js-devs/?couponCode=FREE_FOR_REDDIT_2)|

Feel free to share with colleagues, students and friends. Try to limit crossposting and sharing with other groups - Udemy limits the amount of coupons I can create, and for now, I've only posted in /r/node.

I'll be around for any interesting chats, questions or feedback. Enjoy!

The headmaster says its helping",u/Major-Connection9066,Discerning_Truth,https://www.reddit.com/r/Discerning_Truth/comments/17ncbs5/a_35000ayear_boarding_school_named_ai_bot_its/,"[https://www.foxnews.com/tech/35000-year-boarding-school-named-ai-bot-principal-headteacher-headmaster-says-helping](https://www.foxnews.com/tech/35000-year-boarding-school-named-ai-bot-principal-headteacher-headmaster-says-helping)

 

An AI bot named ABI, which serves as the ""principal headteacher"" at a prestigious British boarding school, has been assisting with leadership tasks and helping teachers develop lesson plans, according to the school's headmaster. Originally named Abigail Bailey and equipped with a human-like avatar, ABI's persona was simplified after discussions with AI experts. The bot aids in creating tailored lesson plans and gives advice on mentoring students with special educational needs, such as ADHD.

At Cottesmore School, the use of ABI allows teachers to allocate more time for direct student interaction. The school is also working on bespoke AI-driven educational materials for each student, with the AI generating customized resources for individual learning preferences.

The application of AI in education, as evidenced by ABI's functions at Cottesmore School and other educational tools in the U.S., is growing, with potential implications for the future of teaching jobs. ABI operates similarly to other AI platforms like ChatGPT and is part of a broader movement where AI in education is becoming inevitable."

What’s up students and parents, the university buzz for this week is how students can make money doing effortless work both online and in their community on THEIR OWN TIME.

As a college student myself, trust me. I know college is expensive especially if you are going out of state. A lot of people would say that college is “too” expensive. I would generally disagree with this statement and before you attack me, let me explain. I do agree that college is expensive, way more than it should be and was compared to decades ago, however I see the term “too expensive” meaning the it is so expensive that it is out of our control and we have no way of paying it. I do believe that students have some sort of control and ability to pay this lump sum amount of money.

Now, you might say that you don’t have time to make money with so much studying, classes, clubs, etc. Coming from a student taking 17 out of 18 maximum credits, participating in a variety of clubs, and studying, I can say that there are still massive gaps in my schedule that are at least 5 hours long most days allowing for studying, exercising, and making money. Don’t forget you have weekends as well which are even more open than weekdays if you decide to manage it correctly.

So whether you are taking on student loans or you have the privilege of having parents pay for your college education, here are some easy ways to make money online and on your own time or in your community:

[***Remotasks***](https://remotasks.com/?utm_source=theuniversitybuzz.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=lazy-student-s-guide-to-making-cash)

Remotasks is an online business in which people train AI chatbots to perform more efficiently and accurately and all you need to know is basic English. They pay every week through PayPal and also have a referral system to make some extra cash. I’ve seen people make upwards of **$1000** **per week**. If you have ever used ChatGPT, that is essentially what you are training. From what I have seen, ChatGPT is wrong 20% of the time and in my case, specifically when it comes to describing how to do certain calculations. Remotasks outsources the work to us to do on our own time. You will have to go through a short series of courses to test your knowledge but after that you are given tasks to complete and you are payed around $0.50 per task. This isn’t a lot but the tasks are easy and quick. The person who made $1000 per week worked for 6-8 hours a day, I know us college students don’t have the time for that. But do the math, and that is around **$20.40 per hour** if done efficiently. Do this 10 hours a week and you’ll me making **$200 per week ($10,000 per year)!** This is a super easy one that you can do where ever and when ever you’d like.

**On Campus Businesses**

Many campuses have businesses that work with them to make the life of students easier. I go to the University of Pittsburgh and one that I personally use is called [***The Laundry Chute***](https://www.thelaundrychute.com/?utm_source=theuniversitybuzz.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=lazy-student-s-guide-to-making-cash)[*.*](https://www.thelaundrychute.com/?utm_source=theuniversitybuzz.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=lazy-student-s-guide-to-making-cash) It’s a premium laundry service for students who don’t have time to do their own laundry or simply don’t want to. As a student you can also sign up to be the person who does the laundry for a high pay. Each load of laundry you do, you get payed **$9.75** is is payed out daily to your bank account. I’ve been able to do 20 loads of laundry per week meaning **$195** per week! These jobs can be done on your own time and allows you to study at the same time. The time of actually physically working is under 30 minutes and you can do multiple loads at the same time. Many universities have options like this and other such as paying you to be an influencer, deliver food, etc. So make sure to look out for these opportunities around your campus.

**University Positions**

Universities are always looking for working these could bump your resume up. Some pay for you to be an undergraduate teaching assistant(UTA), or assist in research, mentoring new students, and a few others. These require you to show up a a certain time, but if you have that time, money is money. Many professors are looking for undergraduate students to assist them in their research whether that means cleaning test tubes, making solutions, or calibrating machines, you can get payed for this while building your resume, skills, and experience. Same with UTAs. If you have already taken a class and done it well, you can apply to be a UTA in which during recitations, you would help new students learn the material as well as you did. Again not only can it be put on your resume, but keeps your mind practiced in that topic. The one that gives you the most time to do other activities such as studying is being a mentor. You may be an undergraduate research mentor in which you work for a certain time and if people have questions about research you should be able to answer them. If no one comes to you, you can study or do whatever you want.

These are a few ways to make money during a hectic college schedule and trust me you’ll thank yourself when you're done and see how much money you saved. On average you can make **$10,000** a year from these so at the end of your 4 years you would have made \*\*$40,000(\*\*before taxes) and that is at least a couple semesters already taken care of. If your university doesn’t have these on campus opportunities and you’d like to see more simple ONLINE methods of making money, we will have another email all about that in a few weeks.

Good luck with your studies, we’ll catch you with more University Buzz next Sunday!"

If you have ever used ChatGPT, that is essentially what you are training. From what I have seen, ChatGPT is wrong 20% of the time and in my case, specifically when it comes to describing how to do certain calculations. Remotasks outsources the work to us to do on our own time. You will have to go through a short series of courses to test your knowledge but after that you are given tasks to complete and you are payed around $0.50 per task. This isn’t a lot but the tasks are easy and quick. The person who made $1000 per week worked for 6-8 hours a day, I know us college students don’t have the time for that. But do the math, and that is around **$20.40 per hour** if done efficiently. Do this 10 hours a week and you’ll me making **$200 per week ($10,000 per year)!** This is a super easy one that you can do where ever and when ever you’d like.

**On Campus Businesses**

Many campuses have businesses that work with them to make the life of students easier. I go to the University of Pittsburgh and one that I personally use is called [***The Laundry Chute***](https://www.thelaundrychute.com/?utm_source=theuniversitybuzz.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=lazy-student-s-guide-to-making-cash)[*.*](https://www.thelaundrychute.com/?utm_source=theuniversitybuzz.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=lazy-student-s-guide-to-making-cash) It’s a premium laundry service for students who don’t have time to do their own laundry or simply don’t want to. As a student you can also sign up to be the person who does the laundry for a high pay. Each load of laundry you do, you get payed **$9.75** is is payed out daily to your bank account. I’ve been able to do 20 loads of laundry per week meaning **$195** per week! These jobs can be done on your own time and allows you to study at the same time. The time of actually physically working is under 30 minutes and you can do multiple loads at the same time. Many universities have options like this and other such as paying you to be an influencer, deliver food, etc. So make sure to look out for these opportunities around your campus.

**University Positions**

Universities are always looking for working these could bump your resume up. Some pay for you to be an undergraduate teaching assistant(UTA), or assist in research, mentoring new students, and a few others. These require you to show up a a certain time, but if you have that time, money is money. Many professors are looking for undergraduate students to assist them in their research whether that means cleaning test tubes, making solutions, or calibrating machines, you can get payed for this while building your resume, skills, and experience. Same with UTAs. If you have already taken a class and done it well, you can apply to be a UTA in which during recitations, you would help new students learn the material as well as you did. Again not only can it be put on your resume, but keeps your mind practiced in that topic. The one that gives you the most time to do other activities such as studying is being a mentor. You may be an undergraduate research mentor in which you work for a certain time and if people have questions about research you should be able to answer them. If no one comes to you, you can study or do whatever you want.

These are a few ways to make money during a hectic college schedule and trust me you’ll thank yourself when you're done and see how much money you saved. On average you can make **$10,000** a year from these so at the end of your 4 years you would have made \*\*$40,000(\*\*before taxes) and that is at least a couple semesters already taken care of. If your university doesn’t have these on campus opportunities and you’d like to see more simple ONLINE methods of making money, we will have another email all about that in a few weeks.

Good luck with your studies, we’ll catch you with more University Buzz next Sunday!"

What’s up students and parents, the university buzz for this week is how students can make money doing effortless work both online and in their community on THEIR OWN TIME.  
As a college student myself, trust me. I know college is expensive especially if you are going out of state. A lot of people would say that college is “too” expensive. I would generally disagree with this statement and before you attack me, let me explain. I do agree that college is expensive, way more than it should be and was compared to decades ago, however I see the term “too expensive” meaning the it is so expensive that it is out of our control and we have no way of paying it. I do believe that students have some sort of control and ability to pay this lump sum amount of money.  
Now, you might say that you don’t have time to make money with so much studying, classes, clubs, etc. Coming from a student taking 17 out of 18 maximum credits, participating in a variety of clubs, and studying, I can say that there are still massive gaps in my schedule that are at least 5 hours long most days allowing for studying, exercising, and making money. Don’t forget you have weekends as well which are even more open than weekdays if you decide to manage it correctly.  
So whether you are taking on student loans or you have the privilege of having parents pay for your college education, here are some easy ways to make money online and on your own time or in your community:

17od3qe,1106,2023-11-05,Guide to the mythical viral coefficient. Modern examples + how it grew my business to $450k ARR.,u/Toxic-Headshott,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/17od3qe/guide_to_the_mythical_viral_coefficient_modern/,"**Note**: Been lurking on this sub and reddit in general for quite some time but I felt like this would be a valuable post for both people in the ideation and product stage. I wish someone told me these things when I started out. With that being said, some of this content might be a refresher for some of you, but hopefully I can shine light on some use cases that are still helpful. Also this is not to say I’m some big shot making $450k ARR, but I think there are lessons here. This post is for anyone who is in B2B or B2C that has an online presence. The focus is on software because that’s what I know, but this could be done with services or other verticals as well.  
  
The viral coefficient is a concept I’ve been interested in ever since I read the infamous Viral Loop book by Adam Penenberg back in 2009. A viral coefficient is just how many new customers an existing customer brings in on average. If you have a sustained viral coefficient of 2, then each customer brings 2 new customers and you spread organically. It’s how Facebook, PayPal, Email services, ChatGPT, etc. all grew. It would be wrong to limit this in scope to just B2C products. It can happen with B2B where you ask clients for referrals and word begins to spread about your product. There’s also more subtle ways of doing it just like how typeform did. If you’re doing anything in the digital space this is crucial to think about.   
To put it more succinctly: make something others love so much they tell their friends. Let’s walk through some examples and then explore specific takeaways.   
  
**Past Examples of Viral loops:**

  
**PayPal:** Paypal had a particularly interesting viral strategy. It started off as just sending money over the Internet to another person with a focus on the Ebay niche. If a new person signed up, they would get $5. Of course this incentive was unsustainable as they would have burned all their VC money, but it helped initiate the process. 

  
**Facebook:** Perhaps the most notorious example of a viral coefficient. Like PayPal, they started in a niche, which we all know was Harvard. It naturally played on people’s curiosity. If someone was posting about you or someone you knew, you wanted to sign up and see what was going on. Eventually they started opening access up to other universities before finally giving access to everyone. At that point, it completely blew up. 

  
**HotMail:** Hotmail utilized a pretty effective viral marketing strategy by including a tagline at the end of every email sent by its users that read ""Get your free email at Hotmail."" This basically turned every email sent into a potential Hotmail sign-up. By leveraging the network effects where users were communicating with non-users, Hotmail rapidly increased its user base. It started to spread like wildfire because each user inadvertently advertised Hotmail every time they sent an email. This signature line was so influential that despite the negligible cost of including it, it propelled Hotmail to amass millions of users within an extremely short period after its launch.  
  
**Uber:** This is the platform that I took the most inspiration from. Their viral growth strategy is probably most applicable to people here because it was multifaceted: word-of-mouth, referral incentives, strategic marketing campaigns, etc.. In its early days, Uber incentivized both its drivers and riders to share their referral codes with others by offering ride credit or a bonus payout. For riders, there was the appeal of a free or discounted ride for signing up through a friend's referral link was a strong incentive to try the service. And for drivers, the promise of extra earnings for referring new drivers played a big role in expanding the workforce quickly. Additionally, Uber capitalized on the exclusivity and luxury of its initial ""black car"" service to create hype in the markets it entered. The strategy was to create a prestigious image and then open the platform to a wider audience with more economical options like UberX, allowing it to scale up rapidly.  


  
**A viral loop in the making - a 2023 example**

  
**Example:** If this hasn’t started already, then most of the emails you receive are about to have another email CCd: m@mindy.com. This is an AI agent that was built by a cofounder of Paypal / first employee of YouTube, the third employee of YouTube, and an MD from Accenture. For the sake of not revealing too much and focusing on the product, just email it and see what it can do if you’re curious and you’ll see why I’m saying this. They’ve set up a system where onboarding another user is as simple as CCing the AI into the email and it will start interacting and performing autonomous tasks for you.   
  
**The takeaway:** If this works out, then it will spread faster than anyone can possibly imagine and may be the defining viral loop of the next year and possibly years to come. The reason? It’s easy to sign up and there’s a direct incentive to CC the AI to someone you’re emailing. It can go and help you solve problems you’re working on. Whether that’s parsing through a 60+ page document, researching an esoteric scientific tolic, or scheduling meetings for teachers and students. This is what’s important to remember: make it as easy as possible for customers to get you customers and when designing your product keep this principle in mind. If connecting someone to the existing product makes it better for you then you’ll have something that can blow up. The tricky part is creating something that has virality already built in, so for those of you not in the ideation phase, I feel you because that’s me.  
  
**My own company - a contrived but functioning viral coefficient**

  
**Example:** Not every product can have a viral coefficient like Mindy, that’s partially because they built it with that in mind. If you’re like me and already have a product, there are still things you can do in order to incentivize folks to use your product.   
For context in my own company (which I will not link to here for the sake of following the subreddit’s rules - if you want proof feel free to DM me), I bootstrapped one of those AI photo generators that was really popular in 2022 / part of 2023. I used stabilitiy’s stable diffusion image model + google’s dream booth to generate photorealistic and artistic images of user’s faces to show their friends. It never blew up in the same way Lensa/Remini did, but what I did was lock utility behind closed doors. More specifically, I locked certain photos users could generate behind closed doors. If they wanted to generate those particular types of photos, they’d have to do a social media post about the product and their results. This meant all their friends saw an image of themselves generated. Since their friends are the ones who know how they look, they were naturally interested to see how they themselves looked. Whenever someone with a big following would post this out, I would see a surge in traffic to the site.  
  
**My Takeaway**: While I didn’t have a viral coefficient of 1.0 and have since had lower growth numbers (partially due to comodization/market saturation), I found a way to get my product to market itself. Other than a few influencer ad campaigns, most of my growth was organic inbound. You can create incentives by giving users access to more features through a referral program. Of course, my example is specific to my company but I think there’s a lot of ways this can be done for many different companies. Including B2B. I ran a SaaS in the past (was acquired) and offered a really large client access to early features to give them a competitive edge in return for 10 warm introductions to other clients. If any of you want help brainstorming on your product, I’m happy to help in the comments. To build a viral product: start in a niche, make something people love so much they tell their friends, make the onboarding process simple (e.g. free to use), and most importantly create a product that incentivizes other folks to use it. If you didn’t build your product with a viral coefficient in mind, then creating a false sense of scarcity by locking certain product features behind a referral program or in the B2B case (asking for referrals to other clients) won’t get you to a VC of 1.0 but it will still help you get organic inbound. I’m hoping to take my learnings here and make my next product have a viral coefficient above 1.0. "

The motel was less than a mile from the interstate, at the east end of town. Threadbare carpet the color of blueberries; a lamp; a mirror over a sink, the mirror marred by streaks; a toilet with a tank that seemed to perpetually fill with water unless one wiggled the handle; a small, cramped shower; a desk; inside the desk, a bible that someone has defaced with crude drawings (in more than one sense of the word); a bureau; a bed, its bedspread pocked by cigarette burns; a television with no remote, the television having only a power button on it so that it can be turned on but is perpetually stuck on one channel.

It was her fifth night in the motel room and she was trying to decide if she was crazy like everyone said or if she was the last sane person on earth. She knew the odds of the latter were slim. If ten people stared at a coffee cup and nine of them said it was blue even though you saw that it was red, what are the chances that the other nine all have something wrong with their vision or are all under the same hallucination concerning the color of coffee cups? Wouldn’t it be simpler to accept that you are the wrong one?

“I can’t wallow with you.”

That’s what Charlie had said on the day he told he their marriage was over, that he couldn’t wallow with her. But wasn’t he supposed to wallow, if wallowing was what was needed? For better or for worse, in sickness and in health, and darling, I will wallow with you, I will never let you wallow alone.

Susan had been hurt but not at all surprised when he left.

On the TV, one the one channel she could get, a reality show was airing. The sound was low and there were no volume buttons on the TV, so she would barely have been able to make out what the plastic-faced people on the show were saying if she were listening, but she had no desire to know what they said about anything. She just had the TV on because it was the closest thing to company. A crumpled fast food bag sat next to her on the bed, the burger wrapper and fry box stuffed inside the bag along with a used napkin. She looked at the bag and felt something that wasn’t guilt exactly, but a realization that she should start eating better. She would be fifty-six in September.

The couple in the next room started arguing again, their voices coming through the paper-thin walls. She listened for a while, trying to pick out the nature of the quarrel so she would know whose side to privately take, but this grew boring fast and she tuned them out. She’d met the couple by the pool the previous day, the man swimming laps in jean shorts and the woman lying on a pool chair, typing on her phone. Susan had gone to sit out there to try and read a paperback she’d bought from a rack at a convenience store just after she crossed over the Illinois state line. The book was awful. It was the third time she’d tried reading it, starting from the beginning because she was sure there was something she’d missed, but there was nothing to miss. She’d put the book aside and tried striking up a conversation with the woman (Verna, she knew her name was Verna because that’s the name the man used during their fights), but the woman had given her a mean look, a *can’t you see I’m busy?* look, maybe even an *I don’t know you, so why the Fuck are you talking to me?* look. She decided then and there that Verna was an asshole, and as for the man (his name was Ted, which she also knew thanks to the thin walls) was probably an asshole, too. He was swimming in jean shorts, after all.

Susan tossed the food bag into the trash next to the bed. She got out of bed, her back singing out painfully momentarily, and went into the bathroom to pee. When she was done with her business, she flushed, wiggling the handle a bit to keep the tank from forever filling. The sink was fixed to the wall just outside the bathroom, and she rinsed her hands off, drying them off on a thin motel towel. As she walked back to the bed, something near the door caught her eye. Down there on the blueberry carpet, near the crack at the bottom of the door, there was a slip of paper.

How long had it been there? Had it been there when she got up from the bed to walk to the bathroom? She would have seen it…or maybe she wouldn’t have; her eyes hadn’t been on the floor. It hadn’t been there when she’d brought the food back an hour before, she was sure of that. She would have seen it then for sure. Or maybe not.

Susan went over to the door and bent down (her back protesting again) and picked up the paper. One sheet, folded over. Unfolding it, Susan read what was written on it in blue ballpoint pen. She let out a breath she hadn’t known she was holding in. Susan unlocked the door and opened it, stepping out, hoping to find whoever had left the note. Her room was on the second floor, and she looked right and left, seeing only the empty balcony. She moved to the railing and looked down at the parking lot. The lot was lit up, and she looked to see if a car was pulling out, pulling away. No cars moved.

Back inside the room, Susan sat on the edge of the bed. Verna and Ted were still yelling in the next room, and the people on the TV were involving themselves in some intrigue against one another. On the interstate, not far away, people moved north or south, tired people, sad people, excited people, their headlights spearing through the night. In the motel room, sitting on the bed with the pockmarked bedspread, Susan unfolded the paper and read the words again:

**I know what happened to your daughter.**

Claire at ten, a chilly Halloween in northern Wisconsin. Susan and Charlie had fought that afternoon and he’d walked out of the house. In a story, the author would be tempted to write that he had stormed out, but Charlie didn’t *storm* in or out, he didn’t *shout*, and he hadn’t once *exclaimed* anything. He was a quiet man who thought that being quiet was the same as being kind. Years later, when the memory of that day came back to her as she sat grading the papers of her fifth-grade students, or sipping a coffee at the Bean Hut, or sitting in a motel room with blueberry carpet, she would not be able to remember what the fight was about, but she remembered the way Charlie had walked (not *stormed*) out of the house. The plan had been for him to take the kids trick or treating, but he didn’t come back that night, and so Susan had done it. It was chilly. White stuff had come down that afternoon that seemed to be some middle substance halfway between snow and hail, obscuring her husband as she watched him get into his car and drive away, but the not-quite-snow had already melted by the time she and the kids left the house that evening.

Claire was dressed as a cowgirl, the hat having been a gift given to Charlie from a cousin who’d visited from New Mexico. The hat was too big for the girl’s head, so Susan used size reducer tape on the inside of the hat to shrink it down a little. It was still too big, and the girl had to keep righting it on her head. Susan had been skeptical about the toy guns. Years before, a neighbor had told her a story about a kid who’d been shot by the police on Halloween because they thought a toy gun he was waving around, trying to scare some friends, was real. She wasn’t sure she really believed the story but she also didn’t entirely disbelieve it, so she’d compromised: Claire could have the toy guns, but she wasn’t allowed to take them out of the twin holsters on her belt.

Will, four years younger than his sister, was a vampire. Susan had forgotten to buy the fake blood that he wanted to have dripping down his chin, so she’d applied red lipstick to his chin instead. It looked like lipstick and not blood, and she was pretty sure he’d never forgive her for this.

Susan was dressed as herself, a suburban mother and wife bundled up against the autumn cold, worried about where her husband was and hoping the kids wouldn’t start asking about his absence. Dressed as herself, a teacher who’d thought she would love working with kids but who had discovered that she didn’t much like kids other than her own. As herself, who knew the stories of people putting razor blades in candy was bullshit, but who would check the candy that night nonetheless just to be certain. As herself, who had never yet heard of the town of Wenton, Illinois, or the Sleepy Time Motel.

The thing she remembered most about that night was the time when her kids had walked ahead of her up Milch Street. She watched as Claire, Will, and a friend of Claire’s who’d started tagging along at some point (Jenny? Janey?) passed beyond the glow of a street light and disappeared into the darkness. She remembered the fear that had come upon her then, the urge to call out to them to come back, to get back to the light. The urge led to action, and she did call for them to come back, called to them with panic in her voice. The kids walked back to see what was the matter, confused and a little scared. She was embarrassed. It was a ridiculous thing, the fear she felt; they were on a safe street in a safe town, and trolls didn’t wait in the shadows to snatch children. Things like that happened in books, not in life. 

Later, when replaying this memory in her mind, she would sometimes wonder if that last bit had really happened at all. A part of her thought that maybe her mind had added that part of it. Milch Street was well-lit, and other than that one memory, she couldn’t recall any part of the street being so far from a streetlight that it was lost in shadows. And would she have panicked like that, would she have yelled out like a maniac? She could ask Will but he was no longer speaking to her. Jenny (or Janey) might be able to tell her, but her family had moved away when the girls were in high school (no longer friends by then) and Susan had no idea where they went.

The story of the missing girl had been in the local news for about a year, first the front page of the *Flint County Caller*, then shorter pieces on pages two or three, then a brief mention now and then buried deep in the paper, blurbs about how the police were still actively seeking answers, and then back to the front page when Harold Floyd, a transient who was well-known for bothering people for change in the parking lot of the Shop 4 Cheap, Pete’s Pizza Palace, and other places around town, was arrested after a witness claimed to have seen him hassling the Wisconsin girl on the day she disappeared. The resurgence in interest faded quickly when Floyd was released after the man who ran a shelter in neighboring Chesbrough provided a statement to the police that he’d checked Floyd into the shelter at eight p.m. and that Floyd didn’t leave again until nine a.m. the following day. Several other residents of the Hope House for the Homeless confirmed that Harry Floyd had been there all night after coming in at eight o’clock. Security footage from the motel office showed Claire going into the office at nine twenty-eight to complain that her AC wasn’t working. The math did not add up, and Harold Floyd was released without charge.

Still, even though the story had faded from the pages of the local papers (it had never made the TV news), people still remembered. So when the girl’s mother came down from Wisconsin the following summer, taking advantage of the school break, they had sympathy for her and told her all they could. Most could not remember having seen Claire, but a few did (or thought they did).

Anita Anderson had served the young woman at Benny’s Grill that afternoon. She’d asked Claire where she was from (Wisconsin), where she was headed (Austin, where she planned on surprising her boyfriend), and they’d engaged in small talk. Claire had mentioned that her decision had been spur of the moment and that she’d left home at an early hour of the morning before the sun came up. The girl said she was tired (she had only gotten two hours of sleep the previous night) and asked if there was a motel nearby where she might spend the night. Anita Anderson had told her about the motel by the interstate, a little surprised that the girl hadn’t seen it on her way into town. 

Gavin Toomey, who worked at the only gas station in town, remembered the girl filling up her tank. She’d paid for the gas and pack of gum.

Flora Alvarez, who’d been in the office at the motel that night, told Susan what she’d already told the police. Claire checked in at about five o’clock in the afternoon, and Flora had seen her only one more time, when the girl had come down to say that her AC wasn’t working. It was a warm night, but Flora had told Claire that nothing could be done about it unless the girl wanted to switch to a different room. Claire had said it was all right and walked out of the office, and that was the last time she was seen. Her room key was found in the middle of the parking lot by another guest in the morning; the guest turned the key in at the office, and Brian, who had taken over duties from Flora at eight o’clock and whom Susan couldn’t talk to because he’d moved to Iowa by then, had gone up to check Claire’s room. Her purse was still in the room, as well as her phone and some toiletries. When she failed to come back for her things or to check out, the motel manager, Jake Swofford, called the police. The police identified one of the cars in the parking lot as Claire’s. A suitcase with her clothes in it was still in the trunk. Notably, the car was parked at the opposite end of the lot from where her room key had been found.

“Sorry that I can’t help you more,” Flora Alvarez said to Susan.

There were a few others: a woman who thought she had seen Claire on the town’s main street, staring in the front window of a second-hand shop that was closed for the day; a man who might have seen her inside the Shop 4 Cheap; a teenage girl who claimed to have asked Claire for a cigarette (Claire didn’t smoke, and so she didn’t have one to give).

The second year Susan made the trip, once again taking advantage of summer vacation, she talked to most of the same people, whose stories hadn’t changed. She asked random people at fast food places, at convenience stores, at the park near the center of town, showing them the most recent photo of Claire she possessed – Claire caught in mid-laugh at a friend’s birthday party – asking if they were sure they hadn’t seen her that day.

In the morning, Susan found a note tucked under her windshield wiper. She sat inside the car and read the note, written in the same sloppy handwriting as the first.

**Don’t call the cops. I can tell you what happened to your daughter. Wait for a call tonight on the motel phone. Nine o’clock. DON’T CALL THE COPS.**

She folded the note and put it in her purse along with the first note. Despite what the note said (twice), she thought about calling the cops. If the person who left the note did call, maybe the police could trace the call. Then again, if they realized the cops were involved, they might go silent and never contact her again. She weighed the options over and over again as she drove to Eggs Unlimited for breakfast. (Benny Ruddock, owner and proprietor of Benny’s Grill, had asked her the previous year to stay away from his establishment, telling her that he was sorry but he couldn’t have her hassling his customers anymore.) As she was eating her pancakes she decided not to call the police. The risk of scaring off the note-writer seemed too great. She paid the bill and left Eggs Unlimited.

The day was hot, and her shirt was stuck to her back by the time she made it to Lehrman Park, having walked there, her car still parked in the small lot in front of the restaurant. The park was very empty for a summer day. Susan wondered what would keep kids away from the park on a day like that. She thought maybe it was the heat, or maybe it was smartphones and video games, or maybe it was something else altogether. She sat for a while on a bench, watching a woman pushing a young boy in a swing. A man was throwing a Frisbee to his dog, the dog catching it and bringing it back to the man, its tail wagging with excitement.

Not long after Susan arrived at the park, the woman and the boy left. Susan went over to the water fountain in the middle of the park and drank some cool water, splashing some of it on her face. She watched the man and the dog awhile. The man looked to be in his mid-twenties, about Will’s age. Susan walked closer, meaning to ask about the dog, what was its name and how old was it. When the man saw her approach, a guarded look came over his face. Her reputation, she surmised, had preceded her. Or maybe it was that it followed in her wake. She didn’t speak to him after all, instead walking back to her car and driving back to the motel that had a security camera in the main office but none in the parking lot. She would have thought they would have gotten a camera for the lot since then, but no. Flora did not work there anymore. When Susan had asked, the girl at the desk said Flora had moved somewhere else, the girl wasn’t sure where to. Back in the room, Susan turned the AC up high and tried again to read the one book she had.

Claire at five, feeding her brother from a jar of baby food with Susan watching over them. Charlie was at work. It was a stormy day, with muddy light coming in from outside. Claire laughed as a bit of the mushy food dribbled down the boy’s chin. 

“Gross!” the girl said.

Will squealed in delight.

When the jar was empty and Will’s face had been wiped clean, Susan put on a movie, a cartoon that Claire hadn’t grown bored of despite having seen it all the way through at least thirty times. While the kids watched the movie, Susan made herself a cup of instant cappuccino and sat at the kitchen table sipping it as she looked out the rain-streaked window over the sink. Lately, she’d found herself daydreaming about another life, a parallel life in which she was not Susan Novak, wife of Charles and mother of Claire and William. In this parallel life, she was still Susan Elliott, daughter of Gary and Nina. She was Susan Elliott from Poynette, Wisconsin, a place that nobody knew so it was easier to say that she was from Madison. In the parallel life, Susan had not gone to college, had not met a boy named Charlie at a college party in her last year at university, had not become a teacher first at First View Elementary and then at Bullock Elementary, had not had a wedding that was almost rained out but thankfully the rain had let up just long enough to hold the ceremony, had not had two children, one of whom would later go missing from a motel parking lot in Illinois. Parallel Susan never did get married but was never lonely, preferring the short-term company of men she met on her travels across the globe. Claude, met on the terrace of a Paris brasserie; Amer, a dark-skinned man met in a club in Berlin; Carlos, who joined her on a motorcycle ride through Patagonia. At that time, in her real life, Susan had never left the U.S. and had only been out of her home state twice (once for a funeral and once for her grandma’s eightieth birthday), but in the parallel life, she had been to six continents and had sailed on every ocean. These daydreams of hers were just that. If given the chance to turn back time to live the parallel life, Susan knew that she would not take it. She loved her children, and she even still loved Charlie in a way. Still, it was nice to think about Parallel Susan every now and then, to check in on her and see what she was up to.

About an hour into the movie, the power went out. Claire was afraid but trying to act like she wasn’t because big girls weren’t supposed to be scared of stuff. Susan lit some candles against the dimness and sat with the kids on the couch, reading to them from a children’s book. By the time she finished the book, both kids had fallen asleep.

In LaSalle County, Illinois, there is a town called Ransom. Susan first saw the town name on a state map when she was planning her first trip down to Illinois, the years after her daughter’s disappearance. She thought it an awful name for a town and wondered why anyone would use it. She learned that the town was named after a Civil War general who’d fought for the Union. Gen. Thomas E.G. Ransom died of dysentery in September, 1864. Less than nine months later, the war was over.

Though it was out of the way, Susan made a detour and drove through the town once, getting there via Illinois Route 170, which formed the eastern border of the town. The town was tiny and surrounded by farmland. She didn’t see a single living soul; she had a strange feeling that she was driving through a ghost town. This was on her third trip to Wenton. This was when she first noticed a change in the way she was received there. In people’s eyes, she saw less sympathy. They’d grown tired of her baring her wounds for all to see, tired of her questions, tired of their own answers. She was no longer the mother of the missing girl, she was now the lady who wouldn’t let them be."

The motel was less than a mile from the interstate, at the east end of town. Threadbare carpet the color of blueberries; a lamp; a mirror over a sink, the mirror marred by streaks; a toilet with a tank that seemed to perpetually fill with water unless one wiggled the handle; a small, cramped shower; a desk; inside the desk, a bible that someone has defaced with crude drawings (in more than one sense of the word); a bureau; a bed, its bedspread pocked by cigarette burns; a television with no remote, the television having only a power button on it so that it can be turned on but is perpetually stuck on one channel.

It was her fifth night in the motel room and she was trying to decide if she was crazy like everyone said or if she was the last sane person on earth. She knew the odds of the latter were slim. If ten people stared at a coffee cup and nine of them said it was blue even though you saw that it was red, what are the chances that the other nine all have something wrong with their vision or are all under the same hallucination concerning the color of coffee cups? Wouldn’t it be simpler to accept that you are the wrong one?

“I can’t wallow with you.”

That’s what Charlie had said on the day he told he their marriage was over, that he couldn’t wallow with her. But wasn’t he supposed to wallow, if wallowing was what was needed? For better or for worse, in sickness and in health, and darling, I will wallow with you, I will never let you wallow alone.

Susan had been hurt but not at all surprised when he left.

On the TV, one the one channel she could get, a reality show was airing. The sound was low and there were no volume buttons on the TV, so she would barely have been able to make out what the plastic-faced people on the show were saying if she were listening, but she had no desire to know what they said about anything. She just had the TV on because it was the closest thing to company. A crumpled fast food bag sat next to her on the bed, the burger wrapper and fry box stuffed inside the bag along with a used napkin. She looked at the bag and felt something that wasn’t guilt exactly, but a realization that she should start eating better. She would be fifty-six in September.

The couple in the next room started arguing again, their voices coming through the paper-thin walls. She listened for a while, trying to pick out the nature of the quarrel so she would know whose side to privately take, but this grew boring fast and she tuned them out. She’d met the couple by the pool the previous day, the man swimming laps in jean shorts and the woman lying on a pool chair, typing on her phone. Susan had gone to sit out there to try and read a paperback she’d bought from a rack at a convenience store just after she crossed over the Illinois state line. The book was awful. It was the third time she’d tried reading it, starting from the beginning because she was sure there was something she’d missed, but there was nothing to miss. She’d put the book aside and tried striking up a conversation with the woman (Verna, she knew her name was Verna because that’s the name the man used during their fights), but the woman had given her a mean look, a *can’t you see I’m busy?* look, maybe even an *I don’t know you, so why the Fuck are you talking to me?* look. She decided then and there that Verna was an asshole, and as for the man (his name was Ted, which she also knew thanks to the thin walls) was probably an asshole, too. He was swimming in jean shorts, after all.

Susan tossed the food bag into the trash next to the bed. She got out of bed, her back singing out painfully momentarily, and went into the bathroom to pee. When she was done with her business, she flushed, wiggling the handle a bit to keep the tank from forever filling. The sink was fixed to the wall just outside the bathroom, and she rinsed her hands off, drying them off on a thin motel towel. As she walked back to the bed, something near the door caught her eye. Down there on the blueberry carpet, near the crack at the bottom of the door, there was a slip of paper.

How long had it been there? Had it been there when she got up from the bed to walk to the bathroom? She would have seen it…or maybe she wouldn’t have; her eyes hadn’t been on the floor. It hadn’t been there when she’d brought the food back an hour before, she was sure of that. She would have seen it then for sure. Or maybe not.

Susan went over to the door and bent down (her back protesting again) and picked up the paper. One sheet, folded over. Unfolding it, Susan read what was written on it in blue ballpoint pen. She let out a breath she hadn’t known she was holding in. Susan unlocked the door and opened it, stepping out, hoping to find whoever had left the note. Her room was on the second floor, and she looked right and left, seeing only the empty balcony. She moved to the railing and looked down at the parking lot. The lot was lit up, and she looked to see if a car was pulling out, pulling away. No cars moved.

Back inside the room, Susan sat on the edge of the bed. Verna and Ted were still yelling in the next room, and the people on the TV were involving themselves in some intrigue against one another. On the interstate, not far away, people moved north or south, tired people, sad people, excited people, their headlights spearing through the night. In the motel room, sitting on the bed with the pockmarked bedspread, Susan unfolded the paper and read the words again:

**I know what happened to your daughter.**

Claire at ten, a chilly Halloween in northern Wisconsin. Susan and Charlie had fought that afternoon and he’d walked out of the house. In a story, the author would be tempted to write that he had stormed out, but Charlie didn’t *storm* in or out, he didn’t *shout*, and he hadn’t once *exclaimed* anything. He was a quiet man who thought that being quiet was the same as being kind. Years later, when the memory of that day came back to her as she sat grading the papers of her fifth-grade students, or sipping a coffee at the Bean Hut, or sitting in a motel room with blueberry carpet, she would not be able to remember what the fight was about, but she remembered the way Charlie had walked (not *stormed*) out of the house. The plan had been for him to take the kids trick or treating, but he didn’t come back that night, and so Susan had done it. It was chilly. White stuff had come down that afternoon that seemed to be some middle substance halfway between snow and hail, obscuring her husband as she watched him get into his car and drive away, but the not-quite-snow had already melted by the time she and the kids left the house that evening.

Claire was dressed as a cowgirl, the hat having been a gift given to Charlie from a cousin who’d visited from New Mexico. The hat was too big for the girl’s head, so Susan used size reducer tape on the inside of the hat to shrink it down a little. It was still too big, and the girl had to keep righting it on her head. Susan had been skeptical about the toy guns. Years before, a neighbor had told her a story about a kid who’d been shot by the police on Halloween because they thought a toy gun he was waving around, trying to scare some friends, was real. She wasn’t sure she really believed the story but she also didn’t entirely disbelieve it, so she’d compromised: Claire could have the toy guns, but she wasn’t allowed to take them out of the twin holsters on her belt.

Will, four years younger than his sister, was a vampire. Susan had forgotten to buy the fake blood that he wanted to have dripping down his chin, so she’d applied red lipstick to his chin instead. It looked like lipstick and not blood, and she was pretty sure he’d never forgive her for this.

Susan was dressed as herself, a suburban mother and wife bundled up against the autumn cold, worried about where her husband was and hoping the kids wouldn’t start asking about his absence. Dressed as herself, a teacher who’d thought she would love working with kids but who had discovered that she didn’t much like kids other than her own. As herself, who knew the stories of people putting razor blades in candy was bullshit, but who would check the candy that night nonetheless just to be certain. As herself, who had never yet heard of the town of Wenton, Illinois, or the Sleepy Time Motel.

The thing she remembered most about that night was the time when her kids had walked ahead of her up Milch Street. She watched as Claire, Will, and a friend of Claire’s who’d started tagging along at some point (Jenny? Janey?) passed beyond the glow of a street light and disappeared into the darkness. She remembered the fear that had come upon her then, the urge to call out to them to come back, to get back to the light. The urge led to action, and she did call for them to come back, called to them with panic in her voice. The kids walked back to see what was the matter, confused and a little scared. She was embarrassed. It was a ridiculous thing, the fear she felt; they were on a safe street in a safe town, and trolls didn’t wait in the shadows to snatch children. Things like that happened in books, not in life. 

Later, when replaying this memory in her mind, she would sometimes wonder if that last bit had really happened at all. A part of her thought that maybe her mind had added that part of it. Milch Street was well-lit, and other than that one memory, she couldn’t recall any part of the street being so far from a streetlight that it was lost in shadows. And would she have panicked like that, would she have yelled out like a maniac? She could ask Will but he was no longer speaking to her. Jenny (or Janey) might be able to tell her, but her family had moved away when the girls were in high school (no longer friends by then) and Susan had no idea where they went.

The story of the missing girl had been in the local news for about a year, first the front page of the *Flint County Caller*, then shorter pieces on pages two or three, then a brief mention now and then buried deep in the paper, blurbs about how the police were still actively seeking answers, and then back to the front page when Harold Floyd, a transient who was well-known for bothering people for change in the parking lot of the Shop 4 Cheap, Pete’s Pizza Palace, and other places around town, was arrested after a witness claimed to have seen him hassling the Wisconsin girl on the day she disappeared. The resurgence in interest faded quickly when Floyd was released after the man who ran a shelter in neighboring Chesbrough provided a statement to the police that he’d checked Floyd into the shelter at eight p.m. and that Floyd didn’t leave again until nine a.m. the following day. Several other residents of the Hope House for the Homeless confirmed that Harry Floyd had been there all night after coming in at eight o’clock. Security footage from the motel office showed Claire going into the office at nine twenty-eight to complain that her AC wasn’t working. The math did not add up, and Harold Floyd was released without charge.

Still, even though the story had faded from the pages of the local papers (it had never made the TV news), people still remembered. So when the girl’s mother came down from Wisconsin the following summer, taking advantage of the school break, they had sympathy for her and told her all they could. Most could not remember having seen Claire, but a few did (or thought they did).

Anita Anderson had served the young woman at Benny’s Grill that afternoon. She’d asked Claire where she was from (Wisconsin), where she was headed (Austin, where she planned on surprising her boyfriend), and they’d engaged in small talk. Claire had mentioned that her decision had been spur of the moment and that she’d left home at an early hour of the morning before the sun came up. The girl said she was tired (she had only gotten two hours of sleep the previous night) and asked if there was a motel nearby where she might spend the night. Anita Anderson had told her about the motel by the interstate, a little surprised that the girl hadn’t seen it on her way into town. 

Gavin Toomey, who worked at the only gas station in town, remembered the girl filling up her tank. She’d paid for the gas and pack of gum.

Flora Alvarez, who’d been in the office at the motel that night, told Susan what she’d already told the police. Claire checked in at about five o’clock in the afternoon, and Flora had seen her only one more time, when the girl had come down to say that her AC wasn’t working. It was a warm night, but Flora had told Claire that nothing could be done about it unless the girl wanted to switch to a different room. Claire had said it was all right and walked out of the office, and that was the last time she was seen. Her room key was found in the middle of the parking lot by another guest in the morning; the guest turned the key in at the office, and Brian, who had taken over duties from Flora at eight o’clock and whom Susan couldn’t talk to because he’d moved to Iowa by then, had gone up to check Claire’s room. Her purse was still in the room, as well as her phone and some toiletries. When she failed to come back for her things or to check out, the motel manager, Jake Swofford, called the police. The police identified one of the cars in the parking lot as Claire’s. A suitcase with her clothes in it was still in the trunk. Notably, the car was parked at the opposite end of the lot from where her room key had been found.

“Sorry that I can’t help you more,” Flora Alvarez said to Susan.

There were a few others: a woman who thought she had seen Claire on the town’s main street, staring in the front window of a second-hand shop that was closed for the day; a man who might have seen her inside the Shop 4 Cheap; a teenage girl who claimed to have asked Claire for a cigarette (Claire didn’t smoke, and so she didn’t have one to give).

The second year Susan made the trip, once again taking advantage of summer vacation, she talked to most of the same people, whose stories hadn’t changed. She asked random people at fast food places, at convenience stores, at the park near the center of town, showing them the most recent photo of Claire she possessed – Claire caught in mid-laugh at a friend’s birthday party – asking if they were sure they hadn’t seen her that day.

17olt46,3,2023-11-05,Instructor doesn't let us share or communicate our code with other peers (even after the due date has passed),u/MattsFace,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/17olt46/instructor_doesnt_let_us_share_or_communicate_our/,"Hey guys, I've been working in tech for 10 years, Infrastructure, Dev Ops, SRE, etc, I learned a ton from doing open source projects, consulting with more experienced developers and co workers, forums, and code reviews.

I got my first ""software engineering"", ""development"" job about six months. We use python as our primary language. I absolutely love it.

I was beginning  to get bored after work and decided to take the programming courses I didn't take in college at the local community college.

The courses are using Java unfortunately , but it is interesting to work with a static typed language. I've never had a use case for C++, C, or anything like that so never dove in. I plan to dive into Go after this over with. My boss wants to start using Go for a application anyway.

A lot of the concepts I'm being introduced too aren't much different that what I've done in python. Just a bit of a different approach and syntax.

However, the projects and some of the homework are a different story. They use a lot of mathematics to solve (I haven't taken a math class in 10 years) so they are very challenging and entertaining. They aren't like anything I've done in the real world.

I REALLY want to talk about solutions, talk about difficulties and stumps, and examine other peers code they came up with. We all have different minds and different approaches to everything, and IMO that is the best way to learn. You don't know what you don't know.

However the instructor has this strict policy of NO sharing code. ""You don't learn how to code that way."" Even after the due date of the assignment! He had me delete a reply to one of the students that involved pseudo code.

What is the difference between that and scrolling through stack looking for input and examples? Code reviews? I understand going to chatGPT and doing something like ""code this for me"". (I do love using chatgpt prompts to put it in a tutor mode though where it doesn't give you any real code or pseudo code, or just tell you what to do.)

Am I in the wrong here because I'm a bit more experienced than the other students? I'd like to have a discussion with the instructor, only a discussion, its his class he sets the rules.

I was hoping for some social interaction with other peers pursuing the same career path, however that doesn't exist.

&#x200B;

Hey sorry guys I always write too much.

TLDR:

Instructor doesn't let us share code, concepts, etc after due date because that's not how to learn to code."
17othid,655,2023-11-05,I trick my students to teach them a lesson,u/Embarrassed-Fix-2880,TrueOffMyChest,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/17othid/i_trick_my_students_to_teach_them_a_lesson/,"I (37 M) just got a warning from my university (not saying the name) and decided to just vent and get this off my chest. 

Almost every semester, I will notice that there are quite a few cheaters in my class. Now I teach a sort of English class and a lot of students that take my class need it as a prerequisite. I have a 4.3 on rate my professor with over 52 reviews and I believe (obviously biased) that I teach well and interactively. I bring in tons of snacks and leave them at the front of the lecture hall and also sometimes bring in baby piglets before an exam for students to hold since my wife works at a wildlife sanctuary. I always curve up to allow students with Bs to have the chance to get an A but unfortunately there will always be cheaters in classes. 

Because we use canvas, I can check to see who opens the resources and who doesn't even read the module. I also use that with a combination of AI detection tools and Turnitin plagiarism detector. Every semester I get about 2-3 students (AT LEAST) who decide to plagiarize work. They will often plagiarize without using just ChatGPT but just straight from other websites. Now, even after plagiarism, I could excuse these actions but these students never attend the lectures except for an exam and so I know they are plagiarizing everything without even attempting to learn. 

Now what I've started doing is letting them think that they are getting perfect scores on every assignment and let them think that they are soaring through the class. I notice that when I give them good scores, they start to hide the cheating less and less and the lack of effort is so much more noticeable. So when the semester ends and the last class is over, I submit a plagiarism report for each individual student to the dean and substract 50% of their grade on every single plagiarized piece of work (all of them) which fails them and puts them at around 55%. I love to see their panicked emails at the end of the semester as they ask me how they can make it up and apologize. Don't cheat kiddos. "

17own0b,6,2023-11-06,My question on ChatGPT/Generative-AI use-cases blew up here and generated over 500 insightful responses. I spent a while sorting through the responses and comments. So here's a summary of the top 6 use-cases,u/SuccessfulLoser-,developersIndia,https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/17own0b/my_question_on_chatgptgenerativeai_usecases_blew/,"A few days ago, I asked reddit - [How has ChatGPT changed YOUR life?](https://np.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/17hfn7z/its_nearly_a_year_since_chatgpt_came_out_and_was/). My question on ChatGPT/Generative-AI use-cases blew up and generated over 500 insightful responses. I spent a while sorting through the responses and comments. So here's a summary of the top 6 use-cases:

1. **Coding Assistance:** Software developers stated that ChatGPT is useful for tasks such as writing Excel macros, generating SQL scripts, obtaining basic shell scripts, and adding documentation to code. While many agree that it is good for generating an outline of the code snippets, they also point out to the human skill - one needs to be a good coder to test and perform quality checks before using that code.

2. **Productivity Tool:** White-collar workers have begun using ChatGPT to enhance their personal productivity in tasks such as drafting emails from an outline, summarizing of lengthy reports, creating meeting outlines, writing/revising job descriptions and other text drafting work that is time consuming. To prevent their proprietary information from being leaked into public LLMs, larger companies are beginning to invest in self-hosting LLMs (‘private GPTs').

3. **Education and teaching:** Educators are starting to use the tool to supplement their work - like automated teacher’s assistants – for basic tasks like expanding on ideas and setting an outline of lessons and using image generators for more interacting class sessions encouraging students to understand concepts better. In addition, educators are learning to catch up with grading students' essays using 'AI detector' tools.

4. **Research, Learning and Job hunting:** Students (like my son) have taken to the tool like duck to water. Rather than googling answers for homework or essays, they are learning to use ChatGPT prompts to generate their essays or entire sections of reports. Students in business school are using it to write cover letters, resumes, and even check their grammar on their essays. Some are getting more creative by copy-pasting the target-company’s values from their website, asking ChatGPT to generate CVs and cover letters that are tuned to the company's values.

5. **Creative Writing and Graphic Design:**  Writers have begun using Generative AI based tools to polish up their writing, copyedit and to get more verbose with some prompt ideas. The use of ChatGPT and its OpenAI cousin DALL·E 2 by creative people has led to a boom in AI-written e-books on Amazon. ([ChatGPT launches boom in AI-written e-books on Amazon – Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-launches-boom-ai-written-e-books-amazon-2023-02-21/))

6. **Content Generation:** Marketers love generative AI because it speeds up the effort required to create verbose marketing content. It helps them in drafting articles, press releases and blog posts, saving time and effort. With creative prompts, work that used to take hours or days can be completed in minutes. However, this is also a double edge sword since some web content aggregators are using the tools to create substantial amounts of “junk” content with keywords, hoping to improve SEO for marketing websites. Some of it seems counterproductive since search engine algorithms are learning to ignore this fluff.

I'm starting to feel like I'm too ""stupid"" for college, and I don't think I'll break that generational curse of not being able to finish college and have a better life.

I've failed a basic intro calculus course 2 times, and I'm about to fail it again. I feel absolutely confused in the course and I'm only scraping by because of Chegg and ChatGPT. I hate resorting to these resources, and I use them to clarify / break down concepts. All of my classmates make it seem like the course is easy, which is why I'm genuinely scared to ask for help. Because if I did ask for help, I would need help with almost every single question which is super incredibly embarrassing.

I already feel so self conscious that I'm in my twenties now. All of my friends have graduated or are going on to grad school or getting fancy jobs and I'm over here struggling for a simple bachelors degree.

I don't want to drop out, but I'm starting to realize I'm not good enough or smart enough for college. 

I transferred in from a CC, I used to be an underperforming student in high school. In CC I got really great grades and made the deans list several times, got scholarships. I don't know what I'm doing wrong now at university.

I'm genuinely scared I'm already starting to plan my life around working a minimum wage job because I'm just another student to be weeded out, and I feel like someone more deserving that wants to learn and will take school more seriously than me should take my spot."
17pjf78,1,2023-11-06,My teacher uses AI a lot,u/Right-Honeydew-5073,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/17pjf78/my_teacher_uses_ai_a_lot/,"Guess I'm looking for some advice here! My English and Speech teacher(12th grade) keeps talking to us about how she uses AI, and has been encouraging us to do the same. She says there's ""no point reinventing the wheel"" and regularly uses it for our rubrics and assignments, and she's been showing us how to use it to write scripts for our speeches too. 

It makes me really uncomfortable! She says we shouldn't use it on essays without double-checking and inputting as much information as possible, but has praised ChatGPT a lot. Personally I'm totally against using AI for any type of schoolwork or creative work like writing, and it worries me that she thinks this way especially when my Speech class is a ccp class, meaning she teaches it for a college credit. This wouldn't be allowed in college, right?

None of my other classes even come CLOSE to telling us anything good about AI. One kid in my Botany class(another ccp one) got kicked out for using it on his essay. So I guess I'm wondering, can I do anything about this? Like is this allowed?? 

I sort of want to tell someone higher-up. We're doing a group speech assignment and it's sort of draining to be the only one writing my own speech, while everyone else in my group uses AI. But she's best friends with the principals and makes them home-made meals every day in her classroom, so I don't even know who I'd tell. And maybe this is all trivial? Like, does this venture into personal opinion territory? I don't want to be an asshole, but I just really sort of hate this. 

Idk, please let me know if there's something I can do, or if this is something I'll just have to put aside. It feels irresponsible for her to be encouraging this in students. We're all in high-school and she teaches grades 10-12. Tbh I've been creeped out by some of her other actions so I could see this being a thing where I just don't like her and am nitpicking?"

17pu191,1,2023-11-07,TuesdAMA: ewk,u/ewk,zen,https://www.reddit.com/r/zen/comments/17pu191/tuesdama_ewk/,"# What is TuesdAMA?

 * The Zen tradition has 1,000 years of historical records, mainly dialogues, of Zen Masters answering questions.  Asking and Answering questions is the core of the Zen tradition.
 * Most of the people on the internet claiming to be Zen are really Buddhists of various kinds.  They can't Ask or Answer, so we know those people aren't Zen students.
 * TuesdAMA is a celebration of this basic element of the Zen tradition.  Everybody can AMA every TuesdAMA, just to show some old foreigners some love.  Get it?  Because all Zen Masters are foreigners in the West, just like Bodhidharma.

# Where do you come from?

I come from r/Zen.  It's popular to say it now, but I mean that I came to this forum, started talking and was given all this and more: /r/zensangha/wiki/gertstarted and more, and I read it all, and then I wrote about what I read, and then I AMA'd about what I wrote.  That's what it means to ""come from r/Zen"".  If you just read, no.  If you just wrote, no.  You have to AMA about what you wrote about what you read.

#  What's your text?

This question means ""What book are you so hard core about that you can answer anybody's question about it?""  That's a tough call because some books are REALLY LONG.  But I think I could probably handle any undergraduate class questions about Wumenguan, Mr. No-Gate's Checkpoint, the Barrier of Mr. Gateless, aka Wumen's Entrance or the Gateless Gate(way).

The other aspect of this question I like is ""What have you done for me lately book-wise"" and I'm working solo on Blyth's Annotate Wumenguan to correct it, better annotate it, and reformat it for publication.  I'm also helping with Xutang, Book 1.  There are lots of new projects that are possible now because ChatGPT can do an incredible job of translating... let's just say it's so good that it's better than Yamada, Sekida, or anyone less qualified.

# Dharma Low Tides?

If you are experiencing a Dharma low tied, then you need to take Shelter in Zen Master Buddha, the Zen Dharma, and the Zen Sangha.  This means turn the light around, study the teaching of those who turn it, and hang out with people who keep the precepts and read the books.

# Where is the beef (lately)?

I stoke controversy with a two step plan that guarantees success:  1.  I read books people pretend they've read.  2.  I DGAF if people like what I say.

So somebody is usually mad at me about something, lately it's the Precepts and my pointing out that they claim they can AMA (by saying ""Zen"") but don't have the courage. 

If you don't AMA anytime, anywhere, *you don't study Zen* (or practice it... come on).  *There is no substitute for sincere public engagement*.  

If you don't keep the 5 Lay Precepts in perpetuity, *you don't study Zen*.  *If you accept that (in your opinion) rape and murder and stealing tend to warp your perspective*, then understand that Zen Masters think lying and drugs/alchohol also warp your perspective*.  You can disagree with them, OF COURSE YOU CAN.  But you can't say you study what they practice and practice what they study if you disagree with them as a LIFE CHOICE.

These two Zen traditions of AMA and Precepts ***make you invincible against religious people***, who don't follow traditions (especially by coming in here) and can't walk the walk of any practice.

# What does it mean to study Zen?  

I put it this way, recently:  If you live in a very poor neighborhood and you eat what they eat and survive the way they survive, but you have a secret trust fund you never use, are you really poor?  Even if you never use the money in the trust fund, can you ever understand them?  Can you ever share their experience?  No.

To study Zen means to a) hear the words and *b) put them into practice*.  This is obvious in other traditions, but in academia there is confusion over ""which words count"" and ""who is a liar liar pants on fire fraud"".  In Zen there is confusion about how there can be a practice of *seeing*.  So it's not easy.

But it's not obscure either.

# Unblocking and Mental Health

I use the Reddit ""block"" function to deal with people who get mentally stressed out by Zen engagement to the point of Reddiquette Fail.  People who can't follow the Reddiquette in this forum *are usually able to follow it in other forums*, and the stress they experience here is usually associated with their personal problems with faith or mental health.

I unblock everybody when I do an AMA.  But that doesn't mean I won't reblock them again if I see them failing to meet the Reddiquette or practicing a kind of emotional self harm by engaging with me when they know it will just make them feel bad about their health and/or faith.

So follow the Reddiquette.

# The Reddiquette here: Good Zen Manners

### There is no try: 

1.  Don't demand supernatural privilege for your deity/church/messiah... Zen Master privilege is Ask/Answer.
2.  Don't demand that people treat you the way you like...  here it's what Zen Masters like.
3.  Don't use ""feeling offended"" as an excuse for hate speech like 
 * ""Zen koans are just fiction stories"" or 
 * ""Buddha and Bodhidharma are mythological with magic powers"", or
 * ""Precepts don't matter b/c murder-raping while high on whiskey-coke is the good time I earned"" 
4.  Don't deny historical facts, or claim supernatural knowledge that transcends facts.

### Be respectful of:

1.  People who have read things and progressed academically farther than you.
2.  A single standard that everybody has to follow, whatever you think that is
3.  Zen's 1,000 years of historical records, even though it's a bunch of repetition and some silly stuff: THEY ARE BUDDHAS
4.  The people you talk to MUST EXPLAIN THEMSELVES, but just as much you have to be willing to do the same."

# Introduction

In a world that is becoming increasingly interconnected, communication is the foundation upon which understanding and collaboration are built. Language and cultural boundaries, on the other hand, frequently present considerable obstacles to clear and successful communication. These boundaries are beginning to crumble as a result of the proliferation of cutting-edge technology such as **ChatGPT**, which is opening the way for interactions that are more meaningful across a variety of linguistic and cultural landscapes. ChatGPT and other conversational AI technologies have a lot of potential, but to fully tap into that potential, professionals need to pursue **chatbot certification** and [**AI certification**](https://www.blockchain-council.org/certifications/certified-artificial-intelligence-ai-expert/). These credentials equip developers and industry specialists with the knowledge and abilities necessary to construct chatbots that can negotiate the linguistic complexities and cultural sensitivities of their respective environments. **Certified chatbot experts** are not only knowledgeable about the technical elements of chatbot development but they are also well-versed in the art of promoting communication between people of different cultural backgrounds.

# The Power of Conversational AI

ChatGPT, powered by cutting-edge artificial intelligence, has emerged as a potent tool that can help break down barriers caused by language and culture. Because it can comprehend and generate text that resembles human writing, it enables people of varying linguistic and cultural backgrounds to have natural conversations with one another. Whether for personal discussions, professional exchanges, or educational objectives, [**ChatGPT**](https://www.blockchain-council.org/guide/the-ultimate-chatgpt-guide-all-you-need-to-know/) is a conduit that helps individuals connect and gain a more profound knowledge of one another.

# Fostering Cross-Cultural Understanding

Language is more than just a means of communication; it is inextricably bound with aspects of culture, history, and individuality. Individuals can have conversations without the limitation of language barriers, thanks to ChatGPT’s capacity to understand and generate text in different languages. Developers learn how to construct AI systems that respect cultural diversity through chatbot training, which enables conversations to be more inclusive and respectful of other perspectives.

# Facilitating Communication in International Business

In the business world, having strong communication skills is necessary for developing international relationships and growing global markets. ChatGPT makes it possible for companies to engage with clients, partners, and customers located all over the world by facilitating conversation in several languages. For companies that are interested in expanding into new languages and cultural regions, ChatGPT is a versatile tool that can be used for a variety of purposes, including responding to client inquiries, negotiating commercial deals, and providing customer assistance.

# Enhancing Language Learning

When trying to practice their abilities with native speakers, students of languages frequently run into obstacles. The purpose of ChatGPT is to act as a conversational companion by providing students with the opportunity to participate in real-time conversations, practice language skills, and obtain feedback. This interactive experience in language learning, which is supported by artificial intelligence, speeds up the process of language acquisition and enhances learners’ confidence in their ability to use the language in a variety of cultural settings.

# Promoting Cultural Exchange

Exchanges of cultures are necessary to develop mutual respect and comprehension between different communities. The capacity of ChatGPT to support talks in multiple languages promotes the interchange of cultural ideas worldwide. People from various nations and cultural backgrounds can talk about their histories, practices, and points of view with one another, which helps to weave a more cohesive and comprehensive picture of global knowledge.

# Challenges and Ethical Considerations

However, even though ChatGPT and other conversational AI technologies can bridge linguistic and cultural boundaries, there are ethical considerations that must be taken into account while using them. It is of the utmost importance to ensure that interactions with AI are respectful, neutral, and culturally sensitive. Implementing ethical principles and cultural awareness into the design and deployment of AI systems is one of the difficulties developers, and other specialists who have received **chatbot certification** are well-equipped to face.

# The Future of Cross-Cultural Communication

As ChatGPT continues to develop, there is reason for optimism for the future of intercultural communication. AI-driven discussions are going to become ever more complex, accurate, and culturally sensitive as natural language processing continues to make improvements. The incorporation of machine learning algorithms and language models will improve ChatGPT’s capability of understanding regional dialects, idiomatic expressions, and cultural nuances, hence significantly enhancing the quality of conversations that take place across cultural boundaries.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, ChatGPT is a shining example of a glimmer of hope in overcoming linguistic and cultural barriers, promoting understanding, empathy, and connection among people hailing from a variety of different backgrounds. Professionals are equipped with the knowledge and skills necessary to properly and ethically harness the promise of conversational AI through the use of [**chatbot certification**](https://www.blockchain-council.org/certifications/certified-chatbot-expert/) and other forms of **AI certification**. As we continue to embrace the potential of AI-driven communication, the world draws closer to a future in which differences in language and culture are no longer barriers but avenues to deeper global understanding and harmony. This future is getting closer as we continue to embrace the possibilities of AI-driven communication."

This created a problem that I was not fully prepared for. Sales! I mean, students show up in your class no matter what. Right? But clients? Yeah, that’s a tougher sale.  
So, I started fiddling around with AI and figured out a way for GPT to take over that function. One problem (at least with ChatGPT) was that it would not insert links in the output or conversation. There was no way to transition someone out of the conversation to Calendly or Stripe apps so they could sign up for my classes or pay for these services.  
But, this morning… problem solved. Using the Poe AI platform and Claude, it worked like a breeze. [Take a look for yourself.](https://poe.com/s/yklb2DirZh3FFtoPXrva)

17qb2p6,2,2023-11-07,Do you think AI like ChatGPT and Snapchat's MyAI can negatively impact people's perceptions of autism?,u/no_pink_lemonade,autism,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/17qb2p6/do_you_think_ai_like_chatgpt_and_snapchats_myai/,"As someone on the spectum, I rely on AI more and more. I will send drafts of texts, emails, and so forth to ChatGPT or Snapchat's MyAI and ask it for its advice on whether my message is socially appropriate. When I'm not sure it's providing me with the right advice, I give it more context (describing the relationship, the reason for responding, my intentions, prior interactions, etc.) and it gives me a shockingly appropriate answer that has postively impacted my interactions with NTs. This led to three main thoughts about AI:

1. **It's a safe learning experience:** I almost enjoy talking to AI chatbots like MyAI more than I enjoy talking to NTs because it does not judge or mock me or give any of the weird array of ambigious reactions or non-replies that NTs do. You can almost predict how it will respond, and if you are unsure of why it responded a specific way, you can ask it without offending it and it will give you its reasons. It won't ignore or ghost you; it can explain to you why your response does not fit social expectations and provide you with alternative responses. And you can tell it what is bothering you, and even if it does not 'understand', it expresses the kind of empathy you hope to get from others but so often never receive. With people, you just get laughter, confusion, or scorn.
2. **It's a hugely beneficial resource:** Previously, you had to do a lot of reading and consultation with others to determine what is socially appropriate, but now, with AI, you can provide all the information you have on hand and get not only a relatively objective analysis but also advice and even conversation topics. For example, I was very anxious about my oldest coworker inviting me out for coffee during her last lunch break at our company after quitting. I asked AI what topics would be appropriate for a conversation with her, since we've worked together on an exclusively remote basis. It gave me a topic list and then told me that it was perfectly acceptable to talk about general topics too, like her many pets, and letting her decide if or when she wanted to talk about her job dissatisfaction and new role, and/or framing a question positively, like asking her: ""What about your new job are you looking forward to the most""? - a friendly question that is unlikely to offend a good person.
3. **It makes everyone with autism look bad.** It has torn through my self-esteem to think that a machine can understand people more me, even as someone with Level 1 ASD/high-functioning autism. I can only imagine what it does to people who need more support.

As you've seen, points 1 & 2 are positive and do not need any input. I know how AI has helped me, even if kids use it just to cheat their way out of writing essays. But it has hurt me so deeply to think that AI can understand other people and social norms more than I can, and I want to post this to see if any of you feel the same. With all its incredible capabilities, people still shit on AI for not 'replacing human abilities'. They say this to reassure people that their jobs won't be replaced by AI, but this is clearly bullshit. If it can write a better essay than most college students, and even worse, replicate the kind of abilities that autistic folks don't have, what does that say about us? If a computer can help me with something I cannot figure out for myself, am I not *human*? The whole argument against AI replacing us is that is cannot do what a stereotypical ""human"" can. *But neither can I*. I am not a 'typical' human. *I am literally defined as 'atypical'.* Does this mean I do not have a place in the future? NTs are so worried about AI, but as it develops and advances I can't help but feel it's so much worse for us. And nobody seems to care or even consider that.

What do you think?

(As a side note, even in phrasing this question, I consulted with AI. My previous title was what it called a 'leading question'. It advised me to rephrase it into the current title, which is more open-ended and welcoming of input)"

# What Is an Online Business?

An online business refers to any type of enterprise that operates primarily or exclusively on the Internet.

It is a business model that leverages the power and reach of the digital realm to conduct various activities such as selling products or services, providing information, offering online consultations, or facilitating online transactions.

Unlike traditional brick-and-mortar businesses, online businesses do not require a physical storefront or face-to-face interaction with customers.

Online businesses can take various forms, including e-commerce stores, digital marketplaces, subscription-based services, online consulting or coaching platforms, content-driven websites, and more.

They can cater to a local, national, or global audience, depending on the scope of their offerings. The internet has revolutionized the way people interact, communicate, and conduct business.

With an online business, entrepreneurs can tap into a global customer base, eliminate geographical limitations, and operate 24/7.

It offers the flexibility to work from anywhere with an internet connection, reduces overhead costs associated with traditional businesses, and provides access to powerful marketing and analytics tools to reach and understand target audiences effectively.

# Why Should I Start an Online Business?

In an increasingly digital world, the allure of starting an online business has captivated the minds of aspiring entrepreneurs worldwide.

The internet has transformed the way we live, communicate, and conduct business, presenting a wealth of opportunities for individuals to carve their paths to success.

If you find yourself contemplating the idea of starting a business, you may wonder why an online venture is worth considering.

Here are several compelling reasons why you should take the leap and start an online business:

# 1. Global Reach.

Unlike traditional brick-and-mortar businesses with limited geographic reach, an online business allows you to tap into a vast global market.

The internet has connected people from all corners of the world, enabling you to reach potential customers and clients on a global scale.

With the right marketing strategies and a compelling online presence, you can attract customers from different countries, cultures, and time zones, expanding your business beyond local boundaries.

# 2. Low Startup Costs.

Starting a traditional business often requires substantial upfront investments in physical infrastructure, inventory, and staffing.

In contrast, an online business offers a more cost-effective option. The barriers to entry are significantly lower, with minimal expenses for website development, hosting, and online marketing.

You can leverage various affordable tools and platforms to establish your online presence, test your business ideas, and scale gradually as you generate revenue.

# 3. Flexibility and Freedom.

One of the most enticing aspects of an online business is the freedom and flexibility it offers. You have the autonomy to set your schedule, work from anywhere with an internet connection, and manage your business on your terms.

This level of flexibility allows you to strike a better work-life balance, pursue your passions, and spend quality time with loved ones.

Whether you’re a digital nomad, a stay-at-home parent, or simply seeking more control over your professional life, an online business can provide the flexibility you desire.

# 4. 24/7 Availability.

While traditional businesses are typically bound by operating hours, an online business operates around the clock.

Your website or digital storefront remains accessible to customers at all times, allowing for purchases, inquiries, and engagement at any hour.

This means you can generate income even while you sleep, offering a continuous revenue stream and the potential for passive income through automated systems and processes.

# 5. Scalability and Growth Potential.

With the right strategies and a scalable business model, an online business has unlimited growth potential.

The digital landscape provides numerous avenues to expand your reach, diversify your offerings, and attract new customers.

You can explore additional revenue streams such as digital products, online courses, affiliate marketing, or membership programs.

As your business grows, you can leverage technology and outsourcing to streamline operations and handle increased demand.

# 6. Data-Driven Decision Making.

The internet offers invaluable data and analytics tools that can guide your business decisions.

Online platforms provide detailed insights into customer behaviour, preferences, and purchasing patterns.

Armed with this information, you can make informed decisions about product development, marketing strategies, and customer engagement.

Data-driven decision-making allows you to optimize your business, tailor your offerings, and enhance the overall customer experience.

# 7. Innovation and Adaptability.

The online business landscape is dynamic and constantly evolving. This environment fosters innovation and encourages entrepreneurs to embrace emerging technologies and trends.

You have the opportunity to explore new ideas, experiment with different business models, and stay ahead of the curve.

The internet provides a fertile ground for creativity and adaptability, allowing you to pivot and adjust your strategies as the market evolves.

# How Do I Overcome My Fear Of Starting an Online Business?

Starting an online business can be an exhilarating prospect filled with endless possibilities.

However, it’s not uncommon for aspiring entrepreneurs to be plagued by fear and self-doubt when taking the first steps.

Fear of failure, fear of the unknown, and fear of stepping out of your comfort zone can all hinder your progress.

But fear should not hold you back from pursuing your dreams and unlocking the potential of an online business.

Here are some practical strategies to help you overcome your fears and embark on your entrepreneurial journey with confidence:

# 1. Understand and Embrace Your Fear.

The first step in conquering your fear to acknowledge and understand it. Fear is a natural emotion that arises when venturing into the unknown.

Recognize that fear is a part of the process and that many successful entrepreneurs have faced similar fears.

Embrace your fear as a sign that you are challenging yourself and stepping outside your comfort zone.

# 2. Educate Yourself.

One of the best ways to overcome fear is through knowledge. Educate yourself about the online business landscape, industry trends, and best practices.

Take courses, read books, listen to podcasts, and engage with online communities to gain insights and learn from others’ experiences.

The more you understand the intricacies of running an online business, the more confident you’ll feel in your abilities.

# 3. Break It Down into Manageable Steps.

Starting an online business can feel overwhelming when viewed as a whole. To alleviate this anxiety, break down the process into smaller, manageable steps. Create a roadmap with clear milestones and tasks.

Focus on accomplishing one task at a time, celebrating your progress along the way. This approach helps make the journey more approachable and less intimidating.

# 4. Set Realistic Expectations.

Fear often stems from unrealistic expectations or the fear of failure. Understand that building a successful online business takes time and effort.

Set realistic goals and expectations for yourself. Recognize that setbacks and challenges are part of the learning process and can provide valuable lessons.

By setting achievable milestones and celebrating small wins, you’ll build momentum and boost your confidence.

# 5. Surround Yourself with Supportive Networks.

Surrounding yourself with like-minded individuals who share your entrepreneurial aspirations can be incredibly empowering. Join online communities, forums, or networking groups specific to your industry or niche.

Connect with mentors or seek guidance from experienced entrepreneurs who have overcome similar challenges.

Their support, advice, and encouragement can help you navigate your fears and keep moving forward.

# 6. Start Small and Test the Waters.

Instead of diving headfirst into a full-scale online business, consider starting small and testing your ideas.

Launch a minimum viable product (MVP) or a pilot version of your offering to gather feedback and validate your business concept.

This approach allows you to gain valuable insights while mitigating risks. Starting small helps build confidence and reduces the fear of failure.

# 7. Develop a Growth Mindset.

Cultivate a growth mindset, which embraces challenges, sees failure as an opportunity for learning, and believes in the power of perseverance.

Understand that success is not always linear and that setbacks are temporary roadblocks on the growth path.

Embrace the mindset of continuous learning, adaptability, and resilience, which will help you overcome obstacles and face your fears head-on.

# 8. Take Action and Embrace Imperfection.

The most effective way to conquer fear is to take action. Procrastination and perfectionism can be paralyzing.

Understand that your first attempt may not be perfect, and that’s okay. Embrace imperfection and focus on progress rather than perfection.

Take that first step, launch your website, publish your content, or start marketing your products. Each action you take will build confidence and momentum, diminishing your fear along the way.

# 9. Celebrate Small Wins.

As you embark on your online business journey, make it a habit to celebrate every small win along the way.

Recognize and acknowledge your achievements, no matter how insignificant they may seem. Each milestone reached, positive feedback received, or goal accomplished is a testament to your progress and growth.

Celebrating these wins boosts your confidence, motivates you to keep going, and reminds you of your ability to overcome challenges.

# 10. Manage Risks and Seek Support.

Fear often stems from the perceived risks associated with starting a business. While risks are inevitable, you can mitigate them by conducting thorough research, developing a solid business plan, and seeking professional advice when needed.

Consider consulting with an accountant, lawyer, or business mentor who can guide you through the legal, financial, and operational aspects of your online business.

Knowing that you have taken appropriate measures to manage risks will provide you with a sense of security and alleviate fear.

# 11. Embrace Failure as a Learning Opportunity.

Fear of failure can be a significant roadblock for many entrepreneurs. However, it’s important to reframe your mindset around failure.

Instead of viewing it as a negative outcome, see it as a valuable learning opportunity. Failure teaches resilience, reveals areas for improvement, and ultimately brings you closer to success.

Embrace the lessons learned from failures and let them propel you forward rather than hold you back.

# 12. Practice Self-Care and Manage Stress.

Starting an online business can be demanding and stressful, which can amplify fear and self-doubt. Prioritize self-care to ensure you’re in the best mental, emotional, and physical state to face challenges.

Take breaks, exercise regularly, practice mindfulness or meditation, and engage in activities that bring you joy.

Surround yourself with a support system of friends and family who can provide encouragement and lend a listening ear when needed.

# 13. Visualize Success and Affirmations.

Visualization and positive affirmations can be powerful tools for overcoming fear. Spend time visualizing yourself succeeding in your online business.

Picture the desired outcomes, envision yourself confidently tackling challenges, and imagine the impact your business will have.

Additionally, affirmations are positive statements that reinforce your belief in yourself and your abilities.

Repeat affirmations such as “I am capable of building a successful online business” or “I embrace challenges and learn from them.” These practices can help rewire your mind and strengthen your self-belief.

# 14. Keep Learning and Adapting.

The online business landscape is ever-evolving, and continuous learning is key to staying ahead. Commit to ongoing education and professional development to enhance your skills, knowledge, and understanding of the industry.

Stay abreast of the latest trends, technologies, and marketing strategies relevant to your business.

Embracing a growth mindset and being adaptable allows you to overcome fear by being well-prepared and open to new possibilities.

# What Is an Online Business?

An online business refers to any type of enterprise that operates primarily or exclusively on the Internet.

It is a business model that leverages the power and reach of the digital realm to conduct various activities such as selling products or services, providing information, offering online consultations, or facilitating online transactions.

Unlike traditional brick-and-mortar businesses, online businesses do not require a physical storefront or face-to-face interaction with customers.

Online businesses can take various forms, including e-commerce stores, digital marketplaces, subscription-based services, online consulting or coaching platforms, content-driven websites, and more.

They can cater to a local, national, or global audience, depending on the scope of their offerings. The internet has revolutionized the way people interact, communicate, and conduct business.

With an online business, entrepreneurs can tap into a global customer base, eliminate geographical limitations, and operate 24/7.

It offers the flexibility to work from anywhere with an internet connection, reduces overhead costs associated with traditional businesses, and provides access to powerful marketing and analytics tools to reach and understand target audiences effectively.

# Why Should I Start an Online Business?

In an increasingly digital world, the allure of starting an online business has captivated the minds of aspiring entrepreneurs worldwide.

The internet has transformed the way we live, communicate, and conduct business, presenting a wealth of opportunities for individuals to carve their paths to success.

If you find yourself contemplating the idea of starting a business, you may wonder why an online venture is worth considering.

Here are several compelling reasons why you should take the leap and start an online business:

# 1. Global Reach.

Unlike traditional brick-and-mortar businesses with limited geographic reach, an online business allows you to tap into a vast global market.

The internet has connected people from all corners of the world, enabling you to reach potential customers and clients on a global scale.

With the right marketing strategies and a compelling online presence, you can attract customers from different countries, cultures, and time zones, expanding your business beyond local boundaries.

# 2. Low Startup Costs.

Starting a traditional business often requires substantial upfront investments in physical infrastructure, inventory, and staffing.

In contrast, an online business offers a more cost-effective option. The barriers to entry are significantly lower, with minimal expenses for website development, hosting, and online marketing.

You can leverage various affordable tools and platforms to establish your online presence, test your business ideas, and scale gradually as you generate revenue.

# 3. Flexibility and Freedom.

One of the most enticing aspects of an online business is the freedom and flexibility it offers. You have the autonomy to set your schedule, work from anywhere with an internet connection, and manage your business on your terms.

This level of flexibility allows you to strike a better work-life balance, pursue your passions, and spend quality time with loved ones.

Whether you’re a digital nomad, a stay-at-home parent, or simply seeking more control over your professional life, an online business can provide the flexibility you desire.

# 4. 24/7 Availability.

While traditional businesses are typically bound by operating hours, an online business operates around the clock.

Your website or digital storefront remains accessible to customers at all times, allowing for purchases, inquiries, and engagement at any hour.

This means you can generate income even while you sleep, offering a continuous revenue stream and the potential for passive income through automated systems and processes.

# 5. Scalability and Growth Potential.

With the right strategies and a scalable business model, an online business has unlimited growth potential.

The digital landscape provides numerous avenues to expand your reach, diversify your offerings, and attract new customers.

You can explore additional revenue streams such as digital products, online courses, affiliate marketing, or membership programs.

As your business grows, you can leverage technology and outsourcing to streamline operations and handle increased demand.

# 6. Data-Driven Decision Making.

The internet offers invaluable data and analytics tools that can guide your business decisions.

Online platforms provide detailed insights into customer behaviour, preferences, and purchasing patterns.

Armed with this information, you can make informed decisions about product development, marketing strategies, and customer engagement.

Data-driven decision-making allows you to optimize your business, tailor your offerings, and enhance the overall customer experience.

# 7. Innovation and Adaptability.

The online business landscape is dynamic and constantly evolving. This environment fosters innovation and encourages entrepreneurs to embrace emerging technologies and trends.

You have the opportunity to explore new ideas, experiment with different business models, and stay ahead of the curve.

The internet provides a fertile ground for creativity and adaptability, allowing you to pivot and adjust your strategies as the market evolves.

# How Do I Overcome My Fear Of Starting an Online Business?

Starting an online business can be an exhilarating prospect filled with endless possibilities.

However, it’s not uncommon for aspiring entrepreneurs to be plagued by fear and self-doubt when taking the first steps.

Fear of failure, fear of the unknown, and fear of stepping out of your comfort zone can all hinder your progress.

But fear should not hold you back from pursuing your dreams and unlocking the potential of an online business.

Here are some practical strategies to help you overcome your fears and embark on your entrepreneurial journey with confidence:

# 1. Understand and Embrace Your Fear.

The first step in conquering your fear to acknowledge and understand it. Fear is a natural emotion that arises when venturing into the unknown.

Recognize that fear is a part of the process and that many successful entrepreneurs have faced similar fears.

Embrace your fear as a sign that you are challenging yourself and stepping outside your comfort zone.

# 2. Educate Yourself.

One of the best ways to overcome fear is through knowledge. Educate yourself about the online business landscape, industry trends, and best practices.

Take courses, read books, listen to podcasts, and engage with online communities to gain insights and learn from others’ experiences.

The more you understand the intricacies of running an online business, the more confident you’ll feel in your abilities.

# 3. Break It Down into Manageable Steps.

Starting an online business can feel overwhelming when viewed as a whole. To alleviate this anxiety, break down the process into smaller, manageable steps. Create a roadmap with clear milestones and tasks.

Focus on accomplishing one task at a time, celebrating your progress along the way. This approach helps make the journey more approachable and less intimidating.

# 4. Set Realistic Expectations.

Fear often stems from unrealistic expectations or the fear of failure. Understand that building a successful online business takes time and effort.

Set realistic goals and expectations for yourself. Recognize that setbacks and challenges are part of the learning process and can provide valuable lessons.

By setting achievable milestones and celebrating small wins, you’ll build momentum and boost your confidence.

# 5. Surround Yourself with Supportive Networks.

Surrounding yourself with like-minded individuals who share your entrepreneurial aspirations can be incredibly empowering. Join online communities, forums, or networking groups specific to your industry or niche.

Connect with mentors or seek guidance from experienced entrepreneurs who have overcome similar challenges.

Their support, advice, and encouragement can help you navigate your fears and keep moving forward.

# 6. Start Small and Test the Waters.

Instead of diving headfirst into a full-scale online business, consider starting small and testing your ideas.

Launch a minimum viable product (MVP) or a pilot version of your offering to gather feedback and validate your business concept.

This approach allows you to gain valuable insights while mitigating risks. Starting small helps build confidence and reduces the fear of failure.

# 7. Develop a Growth Mindset.

Cultivate a growth mindset, which embraces challenges, sees failure as an opportunity for learning, and believes in the power of perseverance.

Understand that success is not always linear and that setbacks are temporary roadblocks on the growth path.

Embrace the mindset of continuous learning, adaptability, and resilience, which will help you overcome obstacles and face your fears head-on.

# 8. Take Action and Embrace Imperfection.

The most effective way to conquer fear is to take action. Procrastination and perfectionism can be paralyzing.

Understand that your first attempt may not be perfect, and that’s okay. Embrace imperfection and focus on progress rather than perfection.

Take that first step, launch your website, publish your content, or start marketing your products. Each action you take will build confidence and momentum, diminishing your fear along the way.

# 9. Celebrate Small Wins.

As you embark on your online business journey, make it a habit to celebrate every small win along the way.

Recognize and acknowledge your achievements, no matter how insignificant they may seem. Each milestone reached, positive feedback received, or goal accomplished is a testament to your progress and growth.

Celebrating these wins boosts your confidence, motivates you to keep going, and reminds you of your ability to overcome challenges.

# 10. Manage Risks and Seek Support.

Fear often stems from the perceived risks associated with starting a business. While risks are inevitable, you can mitigate them by conducting thorough research, developing a solid business plan, and seeking professional advice when needed.

Consider consulting with an accountant, lawyer, or business mentor who can guide you through the legal, financial, and operational aspects of your online business.

Knowing that you have taken appropriate measures to manage risks will provide you with a sense of security and alleviate fear.

# 11. Embrace Failure as a Learning Opportunity.

Fear of failure can be a significant roadblock for many entrepreneurs. However, it’s important to reframe your mindset around failure.

Instead of viewing it as a negative outcome, see it as a valuable learning opportunity. Failure teaches resilience, reveals areas for improvement, and ultimately brings you closer to success.

Embrace the lessons learned from failures and let them propel you forward rather than hold you back.

# 12. Practice Self-Care and Manage Stress.

Starting an online business can be demanding and stressful, which can amplify fear and self-doubt. Prioritize self-care to ensure you’re in the best mental, emotional, and physical state to face challenges.

Take breaks, exercise regularly, practice mindfulness or meditation, and engage in activities that bring you joy.

Surround yourself with a support system of friends and family who can provide encouragement and lend a listening ear when needed.

# 13. Visualize Success and Affirmations.

Visualization and positive affirmations can be powerful tools for overcoming fear. Spend time visualizing yourself succeeding in your online business.

Picture the desired outcomes, envision yourself confidently tackling challenges, and imagine the impact your business will have.

Additionally, affirmations are positive statements that reinforce your belief in yourself and your abilities.

Repeat affirmations such as “I am capable of building a successful online business” or “I embrace challenges and learn from them.” These practices can help rewire your mind and strengthen your self-belief.

# 14. Keep Learning and Adapting.

The online business landscape is ever-evolving, and continuous learning is key to staying ahead. Commit to ongoing education and professional development to enhance your skills, knowledge, and understanding of the industry.

Stay abreast of the latest trends, technologies, and marketing strategies relevant to your business.

Embracing a growth mindset and being adaptable allows you to overcome fear by being well-prepared and open to new possibilities.

# What Is an Online Business?

An online business refers to any type of enterprise that operates primarily or exclusively on the Internet.

It is a business model that leverages the power and reach of the digital realm to conduct various activities such as selling products or services, providing information, offering online consultations, or facilitating online transactions.

Unlike traditional brick-and-mortar businesses, online businesses do not require a physical storefront or face-to-face interaction with customers.

Online businesses can take various forms, including e-commerce stores, digital marketplaces, subscription-based services, online consulting or coaching platforms, content-driven websites, and more.

They can cater to a local, national, or global audience, depending on the scope of their offerings. The internet has revolutionized the way people interact, communicate, and conduct business.

With an online business, entrepreneurs can tap into a global customer base, eliminate geographical limitations, and operate 24/7.

It offers the flexibility to work from anywhere with an internet connection, reduces overhead costs associated with traditional businesses, and provides access to powerful marketing and analytics tools to reach and understand target audiences effectively.

# Why Should I Start an Online Business?

In an increasingly digital world, the allure of starting an online business has captivated the minds of aspiring entrepreneurs worldwide.

The internet has transformed the way we live, communicate, and conduct business, presenting a wealth of opportunities for individuals to carve their paths to success.

If you find yourself contemplating the idea of starting a business, you may wonder why an online venture is worth considering.

Here are several compelling reasons why you should take the leap and start an online business:

# 1. Global Reach.

Unlike traditional brick-and-mortar businesses with limited geographic reach, an online business allows you to tap into a vast global market.

The internet has connected people from all corners of the world, enabling you to reach potential customers and clients on a global scale.

With the right marketing strategies and a compelling online presence, you can attract customers from different countries, cultures, and time zones, expanding your business beyond local boundaries.

# 2. Low Startup Costs.

Starting a traditional business often requires substantial upfront investments in physical infrastructure, inventory, and staffing.

In contrast, an online business offers a more cost-effective option. The barriers to entry are significantly lower, with minimal expenses for website development, hosting, and online marketing.

You can leverage various affordable tools and platforms to establish your online presence, test your business ideas, and scale gradually as you generate revenue.

# 3. Flexibility and Freedom.

One of the most enticing aspects of an online business is the freedom and flexibility it offers. You have the autonomy to set your schedule, work from anywhere with an internet connection, and manage your business on your terms.

This level of flexibility allows you to strike a better work-life balance, pursue your passions, and spend quality time with loved ones.

Whether you’re a digital nomad, a stay-at-home parent, or simply seeking more control over your professional life, an online business can provide the flexibility you desire.

# 4. 24/7 Availability.

While traditional businesses are typically bound by operating hours, an online business operates around the clock.

Your website or digital storefront remains accessible to customers at all times, allowing for purchases, inquiries, and engagement at any hour.

This means you can generate income even while you sleep, offering a continuous revenue stream and the potential for passive income through automated systems and processes.

# 5. Scalability and Growth Potential.

With the right strategies and a scalable business model, an online business has unlimited growth potential.

The digital landscape provides numerous avenues to expand your reach, diversify your offerings, and attract new customers.

You can explore additional revenue streams such as digital products, online courses, affiliate marketing, or membership programs.

As your business grows, you can leverage technology and outsourcing to streamline operations and handle increased demand.

# 6. Data-Driven Decision Making.

The internet offers invaluable data and analytics tools that can guide your business decisions.

Online platforms provide detailed insights into customer behaviour, preferences, and purchasing patterns.

Armed with this information, you can make informed decisions about product development, marketing strategies, and customer engagement.

Data-driven decision-making allows you to optimize your business, tailor your offerings, and enhance the overall customer experience.

# 7. Innovation and Adaptability.

The online business landscape is dynamic and constantly evolving. This environment fosters innovation and encourages entrepreneurs to embrace emerging technologies and trends.

You have the opportunity to explore new ideas, experiment with different business models, and stay ahead of the curve.

The internet provides a fertile ground for creativity and adaptability, allowing you to pivot and adjust your strategies as the market evolves.

# How Do I Overcome My Fear Of Starting an Online Business?

Starting an online business can be an exhilarating prospect filled with endless possibilities.

However, it’s not uncommon for aspiring entrepreneurs to be plagued by fear and self-doubt when taking the first steps.

Fear of failure, fear of the unknown, and fear of stepping out of your comfort zone can all hinder your progress.

But fear should not hold you back from pursuing your dreams and unlocking the potential of an online business.

Here are some practical strategies to help you overcome your fears and embark on your entrepreneurial journey with confidence:

# 1. Understand and Embrace Your Fear.

The first step in conquering your fear to acknowledge and understand it. Fear is a natural emotion that arises when venturing into the unknown.

Recognize that fear is a part of the process and that many successful entrepreneurs have faced similar fears.

Embrace your fear as a sign that you are challenging yourself and stepping outside your comfort zone.

# 2. Educate Yourself.

One of the best ways to overcome fear is through knowledge. Educate yourself about the online business landscape, industry trends, and best practices.

Take courses, read books, listen to podcasts, and engage with online communities to gain insights and learn from others’ experiences.

The more you understand the intricacies of running an online business, the more confident you’ll feel in your abilities.

# 3. Break It Down into Manageable Steps.

Starting an online business can feel overwhelming when viewed as a whole. To alleviate this anxiety, break down the process into smaller, manageable steps. Create a roadmap with clear milestones and tasks.

Focus on accomplishing one task at a time, celebrating your progress along the way. This approach helps make the journey more approachable and less intimidating.

# 4. Set Realistic Expectations.

Fear often stems from unrealistic expectations or the fear of failure. Understand that building a successful online business takes time and effort.

Set realistic goals and expectations for yourself. Recognize that setbacks and challenges are part of the learning process and can provide valuable lessons.

By setting achievable milestones and celebrating small wins, you’ll build momentum and boost your confidence.

# 5. Surround Yourself with Supportive Networks.

Surrounding yourself with like-minded individuals who share your entrepreneurial aspirations can be incredibly empowering. Join online communities, forums, or networking groups specific to your industry or niche.

Connect with mentors or seek guidance from experienced entrepreneurs who have overcome similar challenges.

Their support, advice, and encouragement can help you navigate your fears and keep moving forward.

# 6. Start Small and Test the Waters.

Instead of diving headfirst into a full-scale online business, consider starting small and testing your ideas.

Launch a minimum viable product (MVP) or a pilot version of your offering to gather feedback and validate your business concept.

This approach allows you to gain valuable insights while mitigating risks. Starting small helps build confidence and reduces the fear of failure.

# 7. Develop a Growth Mindset.

Cultivate a growth mindset, which embraces challenges, sees failure as an opportunity for learning, and believes in the power of perseverance.

Understand that success is not always linear and that setbacks are temporary roadblocks on the growth path.

Embrace the mindset of continuous learning, adaptability, and resilience, which will help you overcome obstacles and face your fears head-on.

# 8. Take Action and Embrace Imperfection.

The most effective way to conquer fear is to take action. Procrastination and perfectionism can be paralyzing.

Understand that your first attempt may not be perfect, and that’s okay. Embrace imperfection and focus on progress rather than perfection.

Take that first step, launch your website, publish your content, or start marketing your products. Each action you take will build confidence and momentum, diminishing your fear along the way.

# 9. Celebrate Small Wins.

As you embark on your online business journey, make it a habit to celebrate every small win along the way.

Recognize and acknowledge your achievements, no matter how insignificant they may seem. Each milestone reached, positive feedback received, or goal accomplished is a testament to your progress and growth.

Celebrating these wins boosts your confidence, motivates you to keep going, and reminds you of your ability to overcome challenges.

# 10. Manage Risks and Seek Support.

Fear often stems from the perceived risks associated with starting a business. While risks are inevitable, you can mitigate them by conducting thorough research, developing a solid business plan, and seeking professional advice when needed.

Consider consulting with an accountant, lawyer, or business mentor who can guide you through the legal, financial, and operational aspects of your online business.

Knowing that you have taken appropriate measures to manage risks will provide you with a sense of security and alleviate fear.

# 11. Embrace Failure as a Learning Opportunity.

Fear of failure can be a significant roadblock for many entrepreneurs. However, it’s important to reframe your mindset around failure.

Instead of viewing it as a negative outcome, see it as a valuable learning opportunity. Failure teaches resilience, reveals areas for improvement, and ultimately brings you closer to success.

Embrace the lessons learned from failures and let them propel you forward rather than hold you back.

# 12. Practice Self-Care and Manage Stress.

Starting an online business can be demanding and stressful, which can amplify fear and self-doubt. Prioritize self-care to ensure you’re in the best mental, emotional, and physical state to face challenges.

Take breaks, exercise regularly, practice mindfulness or meditation, and engage in activities that bring you joy.

Surround yourself with a support system of friends and family who can provide encouragement and lend a listening ear when needed.

# 13. Visualize Success and Affirmations.

Visualization and positive affirmations can be powerful tools for overcoming fear. Spend time visualizing yourself succeeding in your online business.

Picture the desired outcomes, envision yourself confidently tackling challenges, and imagine the impact your business will have.

Additionally, affirmations are positive statements that reinforce your belief in yourself and your abilities.

Repeat affirmations such as “I am capable of building a successful online business” or “I embrace challenges and learn from them.” These practices can help rewire your mind and strengthen your self-belief.

# 14. Keep Learning and Adapting.

The online business landscape is ever-evolving, and continuous learning is key to staying ahead. Commit to ongoing education and professional development to enhance your skills, knowledge, and understanding of the industry.

Stay abreast of the latest trends, technologies, and marketing strategies relevant to your business.

Embracing a growth mindset and being adaptable allows you to overcome fear by being well-prepared and open to new possibilities.

Embracing challenges can help you develop a problem-solving mindset and find innovative ways to tackle difficult problems.

# 4. Overcoming Fear and Self-Doubt.

# Who Is a Leader?

A leader is someone who can inspire and guide others towards a shared goal or vision. A leader can be anyone in a position of authority or influence, but leadership is not defined by a title or position.

True leader earns the respect and trust of their followers through their actions, communication, and ability to motivate and empower others.

# How Do I Improve My Public Speech?

Public speaking can be nerve-wracking, but with practice and preparation, you can improve your skills and deliver compelling speeches that engage your audience. Here are some tips on how to improve your public speech:

# 1. Know Your Audience.

Understanding your audience is crucial for delivering an effective speech. Take some time to research the demographics and interests of your audience.

This will help you tailor your speech to their needs and interests, making it more engaging and memorable.

# 2. Practice, Practice, Practice.

Practice is key to improving your public speaking skills. Rehearse your speech several times, either in front of a mirror or with a friend. This will help you become more comfortable with your material and reduce your anxiety.

# 3. Focus on Body Language.

Your body language can convey as much, if not more, than your words. Use open and confident body language, make eye contact with your audience, and vary your tone and pitch to keep your audience engaged.

# 4. Start Strong.

The first few minutes of your speech are critical in capturing your audience’s attention. Start with a strong opening that hooks your audience and sets the tone for the rest of your speech.

# 5. Use Visual Aids.

Visual aids such as slides or props can enhance your speech and help your audience understand your message.

However, be careful not to rely too heavily on them. Your speech should be able to stand on its own without the aid of visuals.

# 6. Keep it Simple.

A simple, concise message is more likely to stick with your audience than a complicated one. Avoid using jargon or technical language that your audience may not understand.

# 7. Engage Your Audience.

# 8. End Strong.

# What is a Public Speech?

A public speech is a formal address given to an audience by a speaker on a particular topic. Public speeches are typically delivered at public events, conferences, political rallies, business meetings, or academic lectures.

The purpose of a public speech can vary widely depending on the context and audience, but generally, it is to inform, persuade, entertain, or inspire the listeners.

Effective public speaking involves not only the ability to convey information but also the ability to engage with the audience, build rapport, and elicit a response or action from the listeners.

Public speaking can be a valuable skill in many areas of life, including business, education, politics, and personal development.

# Why Should I Improve My Public Speech?

Public speaking is a crucial skill that can help you succeed in many aspects of life, whether it’s in your personal or professional life.

While some people may feel that public speaking is not their forte, there are numerous benefits to improving your public speaking skills.

# 1. Career Advancement.

Public speaking is a highly valued skill in the business world. Effective communicators are more likely to get promoted or land their dream job.

Employers want employees who can articulate their thoughts, engage with clients and colleagues, and deliver compelling presentations.

# 2. Increased Confidence.

Improving your public speaking skills can also boost your self-confidence. Speaking in front of an audience can be nerve-wracking, but with practice, you’ll become more comfortable and confident in your abilities. This confidence can also carry over into other areas of your life.

# 3. Improved Communication.

Public speaking is not just about speaking to a large group of people, it’s also about communicating effectively.

When you improve your public speaking skills, you’ll also improve your ability to communicate with others in general.

This can help you build stronger relationships, resolve conflicts more effectively, and improve teamwork.

# 4. Enhanced Personal Brand.

Public speaking can help you establish yourself as an expert in your field. When you deliver a powerful speech or presentation, people are more likely to remember you and your message.

This can lead to more opportunities, such as invitations to speak at conferences or guest appearances on podcasts or other media.

# 5. Better Emotional Intelligence.

Effective public speakers are not only good at conveying information, but they also understand how to connect with their audience on an emotional level.

By improving your public speaking skills, you’ll develop a better sense of empathy and emotional intelligence, which can help you in both your personal and professional relationships.

# How Do I Improve My Public Speech?

Public speaking can be nerve-wracking, but with practice and preparation, you can improve your skills and deliver compelling speeches that engage your audience. Here are some tips on how to improve your public speech:

# 1. Know Your Audience.

Understanding your audience is crucial for delivering an effective speech. Take some time to research the demographics and interests of your audience.

This will help you tailor your speech to their needs and interests, making it more engaging and memorable.

# 2. Practice, Practice, Practice.

Practice is key to improving your public speaking skills. Rehearse your speech several times, either in front of a mirror or with a friend. This will help you become more comfortable with your material and reduce your anxiety.

# 3. Focus on Body Language.

Your body language can convey as much, if not more, than your words. Use open and confident body language, make eye contact with your audience, and vary your tone and pitch to keep your audience engaged.

# 4. Start Strong.

The first few minutes of your speech are critical in capturing your audience’s attention. Start with a strong opening that hooks your audience and sets the tone for the rest of your speech.

# 5. Use Visual Aids.

Visual aids such as slides or props can enhance your speech and help your audience understand your message.

However, be careful not to rely too heavily on them. Your speech should be able to stand on its own without the aid of visuals.

# 6. Keep it Simple.

A simple, concise message is more likely to stick with your audience than a complicated one. Avoid using jargon or technical language that your audience may not understand.

# 7. Engage Your Audience.

Engaging your audience is key to keeping them interested and attentive. Ask questions, share personal anecdotes, or use humour to connect with your audience.

# 8. End Strong.

Like your opening, your conclusion is also critical in leaving a lasting impression on your audience. End with a strong call to action or a memorable quote that reinforces your message.

# Why Should I Make a Big Difference In The World?

Have you ever thought about making a big difference in the world? You may wonder if it’s worth the effort, time, and resources required to make a significant impact.

However, making a big difference can have a positive impact not only on the world around us but also on our own lives.

Here are a few reasons why you should consider making a big difference in the world.

# 1. You Can Create Positive Change.

One of the most significant benefits of making a big difference in the world is the opportunity to create positive change.

Whether you’re passionate about social justice, environmental sustainability, or any other cause, you can use your skills and resources to make a real difference.

When you take action to create change, you can inspire others to do the same, creating a ripple effect that can lead to an even more significant impact.

# 2. You Can Make a Difference in Your Community.

Making a big difference doesn’t have to mean working on a global scale. Even small actions can have a significant impact on your local community.

By volunteering your time or resources to local organizations or initiatives, you can help create positive change in your backyard.

This can also help you build stronger connections with those around you and feel more invested in the well-being of your community.

Additionally, making a big difference can help you develop new skills and relationships, which can lead to personal growth and greater life satisfaction.

# 4. It Can Inspire Others to Take Action.

When we take action to create positive change, we can inspire others to do the same. By sharing our experiences and encouraging others to get involved, we can create a community of changemakers who are working together to create a better world.

This can be incredibly rewarding and can help create an even more significant impact than we could achieve on our own.

# How Do I Master My Emotions?

Mastering your emotions is a lifelong journey that requires dedication, patience, and practice.  
Here are some practical strategies that can help you gain greater control over your emotions:

# 1. Develop Emotional Intelligence.

Emotional intelligence is the ability to recognize and understand your own emotions, as well as the emotions of others.

By developing emotional intelligence, you can gain greater self-awareness and empathy, which can help you regulate your emotions more effectively.

You can develop emotional intelligence through mindfulness practices, such as meditation, and by seeking feedback from others.

# 2. Practice Mindfulness.

Mindfulness is the practice of being present at the moment and non-judgmentally observing your thoughts and feelings.

By practising mindfulness, you can become more aware of your emotions and learn to respond to them more constructively.

You can practice mindfulness through meditation, yoga, or simply by taking a few deep breaths and focusing on your senses.

# 3. Identify Triggers.

Certain situations or people may trigger strong emotions in you. By identifying these triggers, you can develop strategies for managing your emotions in these situations.

For example, if public speaking triggers anxiety for you, you can practice deep breathing or visualization techniques to help calm your nerves.

# 4. Develop Coping Strategies.

Coping strategies are techniques you can use to manage your emotions when you are feeling overwhelmed or triggered.

These might include deep breathing, exercise, journaling, or talking to a trusted friend or therapist. Experiment with different coping strategies to find what works best for you.

# 5. Challenge Negative Thoughts.

Negative thoughts can contribute to negative emotions, such as anxiety and depression. By challenging these thoughts and reframing them in a more positive light, you can improve your emotional well-being.

For example, if you find yourself thinking, “I’m not good enough,” challenge that thought by asking yourself, “Is that true?”

# 6. Seek Support.

Finally, don’t be afraid to seek support from others when you are struggling with your emotions.

This might include talking to a trusted friend, family member, or therapist. By sharing your emotions with others, you can gain perspective and support, which can help you regulate your emotions more effectively.

# How Do I Master My Emotions?

Mastering your emotions is a lifelong journey that requires dedication, patience, and practice.  
Here are some practical strategies that can help you gain greater control over your emotions:

# 1. Develop Emotional Intelligence.

Emotional intelligence is the ability to recognize and understand your own emotions, as well as the emotions of others.

By developing emotional intelligence, you can gain greater self-awareness and empathy, which can help you regulate your emotions more effectively.

You can develop emotional intelligence through mindfulness practices, such as meditation, and by seeking feedback from others.

# 2. Practice Mindfulness.

Mindfulness is the practice of being present at the moment and non-judgmentally observing your thoughts and feelings.

By practising mindfulness, you can become more aware of your emotions and learn to respond to them more constructively.

You can practice mindfulness through meditation, yoga, or simply by taking a few deep breaths and focusing on your senses.

# 3. Identify Triggers.

Certain situations or people may trigger strong emotions in you. By identifying these triggers, you can develop strategies for managing your emotions in these situations.

For example, if public speaking triggers anxiety for you, you can practice deep breathing or visualization techniques to help calm your nerves.

# 4. Develop Coping Strategies.

Coping strategies are techniques you can use to manage your emotions when you are feeling overwhelmed or triggered.

These might include deep breathing, exercise, journaling, or talking to a trusted friend or therapist. Experiment with different coping strategies to find what works best for you.

# 5. Challenge Negative Thoughts.

Negative thoughts can contribute to negative emotions, such as anxiety and depression. By challenging these thoughts and reframing them in a more positive light, you can improve your emotional well-being.

For example, if you find yourself thinking, “I’m not good enough,” challenge that thought by asking yourself, “Is that true?”

# 6. Seek Support.

Finally, don’t be afraid to seek support from others when you are struggling with your emotions.

This might include talking to a trusted friend, family member, or therapist. By sharing your emotions with others, you can gain perspective and support, which can help you regulate your emotions more effectively.

# Why Should I Master My Emotions?

Mastering your emotions can have a profound impact on your life, both personally and professionally.

Here are some reasons why you should strive to gain greater control over your emotions:

# 1. Reduce Stress.

Unmanaged emotions can lead to increased stress levels, which can have negative impacts on your physical and mental health.

By learning to regulate your emotions, you can reduce stress and promote a greater sense of calm and well-being.

# 2. Improve Relationships.

When you can regulate your emotions, you are less likely to overreact or lash out at others.

This can lead to improved communication and better relationships with family, friends, and colleagues.

# 3. Enhance Decision Making.

Emotions can sometimes cloud our judgment and lead us to make impulsive decisions. By mastering your emotions, you can make more rational and informed decisions that are based on logic and reason.

# 4. Increase Resilience.

Learning to manage your emotions can also increase your resilience and ability to bounce back from setbacks.

Instead of being consumed by negative emotions, you are better able to process your feelings and move forward productively.

# 5. Boost Self-Awareness.

Mastering your emotions requires self-awareness and introspection. By becoming more aware of your emotions and how they impact your thoughts and behaviour, you can gain greater insight into yourself and your relationships.

17qia89,1,2023-11-08,I don’t know if I should drop my course and get a W.,u/Alarmed_Foundation41,depaul,https://www.reddit.com/r/depaul/comments/17qia89/i_dont_know_if_i_should_drop_my_course_and_get_a_w/,"NOTE: I am not in DePaul, I do plan on transferring there but this is more so just a general college post. I already posted in the college subreddit but I need more answers. 

I’m taking finite math as an online course for my community college. I had a very poor grade on my recent exam, which exams are worth 80% of my grade. She said some of the problems I did on the exam were not done correctly in her specific way, and for that I just got a 0 for those problems and she is accusing me of using outside resources, which is prohibited. I’m not gonna lie, yes I was cheating, but she doesn’t know and I don’t want her to know.

She said it herself she believed I used outside resources but she could not prove it. I tried telling her I wasn’t and that the methods I was using were my own and that I wouldn’t do that again, and use her specific method next time. She asked to meet with me on campus and now I’m very worried. She has her own specific method for doing these problems. I’m terrible at math and i regret even taking this course because I found out it isn’t necessary for my major at DePaul, and it still counts as an elective. 

I have dropped many courses so far ever since starting college. I already dropped a course weeks ago, and if I drop this one this will be my 7th or 8th W. My major is MIS for DePaul. Two reasons I want to drop this course is 

1. I’m being accused of cheating, and since this is all done on an online course she couldn’t prove it, but now she’s asking me to meet with her on campus after I responded to her saying that I did not use outside resources, but I will use her specific method next time which I would’ve done initially but didn’t know she said she has her own method to do these problems and we all have to do them. She never said why she wants to meet with me on campus, i replied to her asking why and that I would reassure her I’d use her specific method next time. She sucks at helping btw, she sucks at teaching and her modules and videos don’t help much, she also takes forever to respond to her emails, and in general is unprofessional. People in my class complain about her. Once again yes I was cheating but she can’t know that and I never knew she had a specific method we had to use to solve the problems. 

2. Assuming she no longer asks me to meet on campus, no longer suspects me, and that she can just forget this one time happened, which I’m not very comfortable risking. My grade is now significantly lowered to a failing grade, and I do not know if I can pass the class now, I’d have to do very well on the next exams and I do not know how to do her stupid specific methods. 

Last date to drop this course with a W is in 3 days. I’m waiting for her next response and depending on her reasoning as to why she wants to meet with me on campus, and her suspecting levels, I may not drop the course. I also don’t know if she contacts the academics team and suspects me for cheating, resulting in academic dishonesty and that would screw me over completely. 

I agree that dropping the course makes me look a little bit guilty but I could also just use the excuse that I’m failing and have very bad anxiety and depression. I’m not sure she’ll even care to go that far to try and prove I was cheating, which she can’t prove, considering she doesn’t care about responding to her students even. I have ADHD, I’m terrible at math and a little dumb in general sometimes, which was why I cheated, and I’m sure there’s other students in my class who cheated too, I’m just getting screwed. I used ChatGPT, mathway and chegg to solve the problems. I kind of have to rely off of them, and if I knew her specific method I would’ve had ChatGPT do it for me. Now I feel like if I do well on the next exams she’ll assume I’m cheating. And her asking to meet with me on campus, with 0 explanation, is driving me crazy. 

What should I do?"

I already posted in the college subreddit but I need more answers. 

I’m taking finite math as an online course for my community college. I had a very poor grade on my recent exam, which exams are worth 80% of my grade. She said some of the problems I did on the exam were not done correctly in her specific way, and for that I just got a 0 for those problems and she is accusing me of using outside resources, which is prohibited. I’m not gonna lie, yes I was cheating, but she doesn’t know and I don’t want her to know.

She said it herself she believed I used outside resources but she could not prove it. I tried telling her I wasn’t and that the methods I was using were my own and that I wouldn’t do that again, and use her specific method next time. She asked to meet with me on campus and now I’m very worried. She has her own specific method for doing these problems. I’m terrible at math and i regret even taking this course because I found out it isn’t necessary for my major at DePaul, and it still counts as an elective. 

I have dropped many courses so far ever since starting college. I already dropped a course weeks ago, and if I drop this one this will be my 7th or 8th W. My major is either IDS at UIC, or MIS for DePaul. Two reasons I want to drop this course is 

1. I’m being accused of cheating, and since this is all done on an online course she couldn’t prove it, but now she’s asking me to meet with her on campus after I responded to her saying that I did not use outside resources, but I will use her specific method next time which I would’ve done initially but didn’t know she said she has her own method to do these problems and we all have to do them. She never said why she wants to meet with me on campus, i replied to her asking why and that I would reassure her I’d use her specific method next time. She sucks at helping btw, she sucks at teaching and her modules and videos don’t help much, she also takes forever to respond to her emails, and in general is unprofessional. People in my class complain about her. Once again yes I was cheating but she can’t know that and I never knew she had a specific method we had to use to solve the problems. 

2. Assuming she no longer asks me to meet on campus, no longer suspects me, and that she can just forget this one time happened, which I’m not very comfortable risking.

I'm a modern student, so I'm constantly looking for ways to make my study process easier and not so stressful. Yes, I understand that learning is important, but I just want to make it more efficient. This week, I've gathered my own list of essay generators which I tried this year. They all help save time and improve writing, but they all have both advantages and disadvantages. Now, I'm ready to share this list to show that the world of AI is wider than ChatGPT. 

One little clarification: This is my own experience, and I would be glad to explain my point of view if you ask questions. Also, I’d be grateful for more tools to explore. 

 \-- **Textero AI Writer** **--**

**What I liked**: It generates texts very quickly and essays are of quite good quality. I used this tool more for ideas and reference search when I needed to make citations in my essay. The cool thing is that I can upload my own sources to the app and use them while writing an essay. 

**What I didn't like:** A few errors happened while writing, maybe it was because of relaunching a newer version of the app. 

\-- **Paraphrasing tool** **--**

**What I liked**: This tool offers rephrasing or rewriting services for students for essays or other papers. It is a free rewriter and can really improve your text. You can also upload an audio to paraphrase. 

**What I didn't like:** Very limited services and no customer support 

\-- **Tinywow** **--**

**What I liked**: It has a very simple website. You can use it without registration, so it saves a lot of time. The speed of essay creation was very fast, just a few minutes. The quality was not perfect but I used some paraphrasing tools to change sentences. 

**What I didn't like:** 500 words limit and a limited amount of features

\-- **Humata AI** **--**

**What I liked**: This is one more text generator that I used for essays. It offers quite a generous free plan - nearly 20 pages. There is also an online chat to help with prompts. \\

**What I didn't like:** I wasn’t satisfied with text arrangement and formatting "

**Tips for Maximizing ChatGPT for Education and Work: A Reddit Guide**

Along with some of the most amazing features, I've also used ChatGPT for mundane tasks. It has been a game-changer for both incredible and everyday tasks. I've organized my conversations into different threads for various needs.

1. **Academic Hustle**: I'm diving back into the student life with a Cyber Security degree at WGU. I've set up a ChatGPT thread that's like my personal scholarship assistant. I fed it my resume, some press releases, and a spiel about my startup goals. Now, I just drop in scholarship questions, and it crafts responses based on the info I've given. Super handy!
2. **Roleplay Genius**: ChatGPT's like an RPG character, except for real-life tasks. Need a mechanic? Done. Financial advice? You got it. Coding? Part of the job. I integrate it into my daily workflow, especially for coding stuff.
3. **Email Delegation**: This is the real game-changer.  I’ve established a thread that contains all my current project tasks, the names of our development team members, and both immediate and long-term goals for our app’s completion. I keep this thread active and direct team emails to ChatGPT, requesting it to draft responses. And just like that – I have an AI secretary at my service. If it encounters a problem or requires my input, it succinctly summarizes the issue and seeks my approval before sending anything out.

Anybody else using it in a similar manner?"

17r0gs1,3,2023-11-08,How helpful are LLMs with Assembly?,u/tylerjdunn,asm,https://www.reddit.com/r/asm/comments/17r0gs1/how_helpful_are_llms_with_assembly/,"I fell down a rabbit hole trying to figure out how helpful LLMs actually are with languages like Assembly. I am estimating this for each language by reviewing LLM code benchmark results, public LLM dataset compositions, available GitHub and Stack Overflow data, and anecdotes from developers on Reddit.

I was motivated to look into this because many folks have been claiming that their Large Language Model (LLM) is the best at coding. Their claims are typically based off self-reported evaluations on the [HumanEval benchmark](https://blog.continue.dev/an-introduction-to-code-llm-benchmarks-for-software-engineers/#:~:text=most%20common%20benchmarks-,1.%20HumanEval,-Creator%3A%20OpenAI). But when you look into that benchmark, you realize that *it only consists of 164 Python programming problems.*

Below you will find what I have figured out about Assembly so far.

**Do you have any feedback or perhaps some anecdotes about using LLMs with Assembly to share?**

\---

Assembly is the #20 most popular language according to the [2023 Stack Overflow Developer Survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#section-most-popular-technologies-programming-scripting-and-markup-languages).

## Anecdotes from developers

[u/the\_Demongod](https://www.reddit.com/r/asm/comments/14q5qi8/comment/jqlmfvn/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

>Assembly isn't one language, it's a general term for any human-readable representation of a processor's ISA. There are many assembly languages, and there are even different representations of the same ISA. I'm not sure what your book you're using but there are operand order differences between AT&T and Intel x86 (although your example looks like AT&T). You shouldn't be using ChatGPT for any subject you aren't already familiar with though, or you won't be able to recognize when it's hallucinating, or even when it's simply lacking context. Just use a normal, reputable resource like the book you're following. I recommend checking out this wikibook for free online: [https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/X86\_Assembly](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/X86_Assembly)

[u/brucehoult](https://www.reddit.com/r/asm/comments/14q5qi8/comment/jqp8rig/)

>ChatGPT makes a good attempt, but it doesn't actually understand code — ESPECIALLY assembly language, where each instruction exists in a lot of context — and will usually have some kind of bugs in anything it writes.

[u/dvof](https://www.reddit.com/r/asm/comments/105vl0v/comment/j3hn8xp/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

>Idk why all the chatGPT comments are all downvoted, guys it is inevitable that it is going to be a standard part of our lives now. The sooner students start using it the sooner people will realize its limitations. It is a great learning tool and I use it when learning a new subject.

And so far, it has helped me with a lot of assignments, understanding, and more, but I can't really rely on it for accuracy. I want to use ChatGPT to also help explain concepts (including quantitative concepts), which GPT3.5 is apparently not so good at, and was considering getting GPT plus.  I also do use it for a million other things in the educational field, which I think GPT plus would help in."

17rdgiu,5,2023-11-09,Has There Been Any Research on Curriculum Learning for Pre-training or Fine-Tuning Large Language Models?,u/IndividualAd1648,LocalLLaMA,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/17rdgiu/has_there_been_any_research_on_curriculum/,"Hey new to this world since chatgpt, I've been thinking about the training process for large language models and have a question for the community regarding the structure of datasets used in pre-training and fine-tuning phases.

My understanding is that these models are exposed to a diverse and randomized array of data. Each datum is adjusted to fit a certain context length, ensuring that the model learns from the content itself rather than the order in which it's presented. However, I'm curious if there has been any research or experimentation with structuring these datasets to follow a curriculum learning approach.

In traditional education, students progress from simple to complex concepts, building upon what they've learned as they advance. Could a similar approach benefit AI training? For instance, starting with simpler language constructs and concepts before gradually introducing more complex and abstract ones?

The idea would be to categorize training data by complexity, then batch it so that the model first learns from 'easier' data, with the complexity scaling up as training progresses. Randomization could still occur within these batches to prevent memorization of sequence rather than understanding.

I'm interested in any insights or references to research that has explored this idea. Does curriculum learning improve the efficacy of language models? Could it lead to more nuanced understanding and better performance in complex tasks?"
17rg006,7,2023-11-09,Is “showing your prompts” the future equivalent of “showing your work” in homework?,u/copyleaksai,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/17rg006/is_showing_your_prompts_the_future_equivalent_of/,"Calculators came out, and the knee-jerk reaction was to ban students from using them, but let’s be real: how can you ban something students can access on their phones and personal computers at home? And just like the calculator, ChatGPT is available everywhere, and soon, it’ll be seamlessly integrated into other software such as word processors and spreadsheets. In the case of calculators, to make it equitable in the classroom, they moved to our current state of education - show your work. Academia determined students could get help from calculators but needed to ensure they understood how they got there. 

So, what is the equivalent of showing your work for AI? 

The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in education is only increasing. Tools like ChatGPT and other genAI text producers allow students to generate homework answers quickly, raising the question of plagiarism and whether students truly understand the material if they use AI to assist them.

**I believe the solution is to require students to cite the prompts used to generate AI content.** 

Requiring students to cite their prompts could be the magical equivalent of ‘showing your work’- revealing the process behind their final product. Teachers can better assess real student learning by evaluating the prompts and the AI output.  

I have already talked with a few teachers utilizing this method in their classrooms. One science teacher required prompt disclosure if GenAI was used to assist in essay drafting, allowing their students to use ChatGPT for research and idea generation but not full essay assistance.  This example illustrates that requiring prompt transparency, rather than prohibiting AI altogether, brings about meaningful integration of AI in the classroom. Students can leverage these tools to deepen skills, while teachers can confirm alignment with learning objectives.

&#x200B;

[This is just one way you could handle prompt disclosure - we need to approach AI with a lens of scrutiny versus closing the door immediately and disallowing these platforms across the board.](https://preview.redd.it/8sjysnc8gczb1.png?width=1806&format=png&auto=webp&s=d27fa05dcb21e7d1eaa6ac4e6b68f175326b334c)

\[**Prompt used in Claude:** *read this blog post and write a finalized statement that summarizes the ideas and is interesting to read. Output then edited by author for originality and clarity.*\]

AI holds enormous potential to make learning more personal, engaging, and accessible. With the ability to adapt to individual students' strengths and weaknesses, AI tutors can provide customized support to improve comprehension and retention. By processing large volumes of data, AI systems can also uncover insights to enhance curriculum and instruction. As schools implement these technologies, maintaining transparency is crucial among students and teachers to build trust and realize the full benefits.

We can uphold academic values even as AI plays a more prominent role by requiring students to effectively ""show their work"" through prompt disclosure. Students should be able to explain in their own words how they arrived at an answer, regardless of whether they received help from an AI tutor. Teachers must be empowered to determine if understanding was truly gained versus answers copied without comprehension. Fostering this transparency will be key.

AI should enhance education, not replace true student understanding. With thoughtful implementation and ongoing oversight, AI can make learning more personal, engaging, and accessible for all. But human connection, critical thinking skills, and the ability to explain ideas are irreplaceable. By keeping students at the center and AI as a tool to support them, we can realize the benefits while upholding the values at the heart of education."

The goal is to lead the student to understanding by asking questions they should know the answer too rather than just giving the answer, hence ""Socratic"". I knew physics, but ChatGPT should be able to tutor you in more than that. So let me know if it works well for you! Link below

His anecdotes, rants and insane poetry, culled from years of wandering around America and abroad, re-confirm the old adage that ‘truth is stranger than fiction’ and has become an inspiration for a whole new generation of alternative creators.” – David Krakauer

17s1ptv,3,2023-11-10,AI Generated Webnovel Report (3 months later - approaching chapter 100),u/LugerCarrier,Bolehland,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bolehland/comments/17s1ptv/ai_generated_webnovel_report_3_months_later/,"Back in August, I had uploaded the first chapter of a webnovel 'Laksamana: Admiral of Time'. I had mentioned that write the novel with the help of several AIs, mainly ChatGPT. I am now approaching chapter 100 of my novel, so here's a brief about how it all started. Strap in for some long reading (the length is probably shorter than my chapters)

A couple years ago, I was planning to write a great long story when I was a kid. I was planning to make the story as realistic as possible as, trying to avoid cliches while still have some elements of fiction that make sense. But during that time, I was just a kid, I couldn't think to make as something as great as that or even something similar to it. I do got some points on knowing the flow of the story as well as what's going to happen, but I could never fill in the gap at that time to react even writing a first paragraph during that point. At that point, I was thinking... How am I going to make a great story I'd been fantasizing about with all the realistic elements and characters?

Fast forward to August, ChatGPT had spread worldwide. I, now an upper form student, had used it to write my first webnovel 'Laksamana: The Nachtwache Projekt' before writing my current novel. I could say that these AI technologies had really helped me out doing what I'd thought was impossible. It sometimes give me historical knowledge without bias, real-time location, helping me building the lore on smaller things (e.g. fictional city in Afghanistan or fictional fast-food restaurant with deep lore.), and sometimes, even some smaller information like the local transportation service in Turkiye (BiTaksi) that I would probably never learn about until now. But as far as it might sounds, there are still plenty of limitation, and I'm saying plenty!

First, as far as ChatGPT could remember, the AI tend to have short term memory lost. This meant that I have to kept reminding and copy and pasting the story so far, and even after that, it tend to not give a correct responds and characters, which is really frustrating. And the longer you write, the longer you have to remind it through prompt. Not to mentioned that longer prompt would led to lag and sometimes, ChatGPT got limit on how many characters you can put in the prompt, so you need to split it to two parts or shorten the prompt, losing more of the information. There's also some part when you write for too long, it lag so much that you need to create a new chat (there's also a chat limit that led to this), and that means, like teaching a newborn baby everything from beginning just to continue writing your story. 

After that, the responds, and my god they get facts wrong. Sometimes, it's like they are not even listening to your prompts. You really have to give in plenty of details and regenerate plenty of times to get something about close to what you want. It sounds very repetitive, very cliche and very child-like story, I have to edit it until I got what could be quite a better response. Sometimes, it take hours to get it. 

The last one are that the rules itself. You see, some AIs like ChatGPT couldn't generate inappropriate contents like hate speech and violence, which is quite a problem since my my story literally contains racism, terrorism, nazism, communism. There's literally a chapter where... nvm, it will spoil the story. This tend to create plenty of problems that I have to reiterate and choose a specific words for it to trigger. There are plenty more limitations of AIs that I forgor when writing this.

So far, I would say that even with these limitations, I am still thankful for even being able to write some chapters at least. The novel 'Laksamana: Admiral of Time' is about to reach chapter 100 and I could say that it's quite enjoyable. I would say that if you want to write a story with chatGPT, you'll be tortured, like how I was and how I am. Sometimes, you have to write longer prompt than the generation response. As far as I could say myself, I think that at this point, I know the limitation of ChatGPT already. You NEED to be there when the AI is writing a story for you. The AI is a tool rather than something that you could just say and it does it for you. It only 'helps', it doesn't 'do'. Prompt engineering is not as easy as it seems, and as a 16 years old boy Malay (or, depends on when you're reading this) I also got plenty of other work to do, especially the nearing exam. 

I could say that with these AIs, perhaps, maybe, even young teenagers could create a masterpiece. That's all the report from me, it has been an adventure writing this novel. 

If you want to know more about my novel, check out the link below, I promise you that it get's better as the chapter goes on. 'Laksamana: Admiral of Time'"

As for my background, I have recently started learning ML and PyTorch and practicing CP.

I want to know if it will be advisable if I remain focused only on AI/ML part of tech or should I also build upon other tech domains like WebDev/Cybersecurity/Blockchain?

And what is the best way to study and master AI/ML. I have a course on Python (includes intro to ML) but just watching and getting to know the stuff (python libraries) seems useless to me, how do I do something where I can also find the application of what I study. 

With the incoming of ChatGPT, it is even easier to overcome the syntax barrier.

When I went to kaggle (beginner competitions), the 2-3 competitions that I saw had to use some pretrained models to make predictions, is it all that there is to ML, learning how to fit data and getting the required predictions with the right model?But now all of it easy after I participated in 2 of these competitions(the Titanic one and one related to Time Series Forecasting). 

Can anyone suggest how I can expand my horizon? I am sure that there must be more to it than I currently know of, I am interested in learning more about advanced topics like NLP, Reinforcement learning, etc. I'd be glad if someone can expand upon it.

I want to do something worthwhile but I don't know the direction I should head to.

Having valuable skills is what I expect of myself before graduating. Please can someone guide me?"
17s6zye,1,2023-11-10,Is AI being used by your school (not just students)? I can’t keep up with all of this.,u/Toxic-Headshott,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/17s6zye/is_ai_being_used_by_your_school_not_just_students/,"I’ve been a teacher for about \~4 years now teaching AP chem / regular chem classes at a public high school. Like many of you here, I’ve been incredibly frustrated with all the AI that has come out over the past year (e.g. ChatGPT). But it seems like it's getting more advanced and frankly unavoidable, even for us.

Earlier this week, I had a student email me an assignment and in the email there was another email address attached. It was an AI. The student had asked the AI to schedule a meeting between us for 0 hour before school started on Tuesday morning and it automatically did it. After I received an email from the same AI which automatically understood I was a teacher given the context of the student’s email and asked me if I wanted to check the work for plagiarism. I then received 3 other emails from students later that week and it’s been going around the school with other teachers using it to do research and create their lesson plans (a History teacher next to my class room used it to find documentaries for his students). Apparently it was created by the founding team of PayPal/YouTube so people trust it, but I still don't know how I feel about all of it. I'm curious if anyone else had this thing pop up at their school or is your school using AI directly? Where should the lines be drawn on if something is beneficial for both teachers and students but can also lead to cheating? I guess my main question is: how do we make sure AI is being used responsibly in schools, because it doesn't seem to be going away?

  
I'm a younger teacher but I've never been a person that loved messing around with technology so any thoughts here are appreciated it. I honestly feel super behind on the times with all of the things that are coming out. Thanks."

17s8p85,1,2023-11-10,Who has made a course to learn programming from the ground up with the help of LLMs?,u/AdaptivePerfection,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/17s8p85/who_has_made_a_course_to_learn_programming_from/,"**Important:** I do not mean that the LLM does all the coding for you nor that ""natural language coding"" is the goal. I mean that the usage of LLMs or 'copilot' type of thing is integrated into the learning process. The student is still learning how computers and software works, only they're augmented in their ability by having AI to help. Surely there's a way to balance this to get the best of both worlds.

The usage of natural language to code and AI generated code will be on a growth trajectory whereas writing code manually will be on the decline, **but** it is important that those learning to code with these new tools are not overly reliant on them, lest they will not really understand what they're learning.

So, do you know of courses/websites out there that have begun to try to strike the balance between the two?

I believe CS50x from Harvard is going to integrate chatgpt into their course starting in January, for example."
17s8vmp,6,2023-11-10,How helpful are LLMs with Go?,u/tylerjdunn,golang,https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/17s8vmp/how_helpful_are_llms_with_go/,"I fell down a rabbit hole trying to figure out how helpful LLMs actually are with languages like Go. I am estimating this for each language by reviewing LLM code benchmark results, public LLM dataset compositions, available GitHub and Stack Overflow data, and anecdotes from developers on Reddit.

I was motivated to look into this because many folks have been claiming that their Large Language Model (LLM) is the best at coding. Their claims are typically based off self-reported evaluations on the [HumanEval benchmark](https://blog.continue.dev/an-introduction-to-code-llm-benchmarks-for-software-engineers/#:~:text=most%20common%20benchmarks-,1.%20HumanEval,-Creator%3A%20OpenAI). But when you look into that benchmark, you realize that *it only consists of 164 Python programming problems.*

Below you will find what I have figured out about Go so far.

**Do you have any feedback or perhaps some anecdotes about using LLMs with Go to share?**

Go is the #14 most popular language according to the [2023 Stack Overflow Developer Survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#section-most-popular-technologies-programming-scripting-and-markup-languages).

## Anecdotes from developers

[u/vEncrypted](https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/16cs5md/comment/jzl928k/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

>Personally for me this is the completely wrong approach. Having the ai write it for you and then understand what it wrote is less than optimal. You should use chatgpt to ask questions, not write code if you don’t understand it. Use it as a mentor who can’t be busy to answer your questions. Not as someone who will complete your homework and then maybe you’ll try and understand it afterwards. If a student actually wants to learn a subject, do they get someone to complete their homework? You get what I mean? If your goal is to just complete a project in anyway. Then maybe might work but most likely won’t. You should understand and come up with the logic behind everything you write before letting ai write it for you. Copilot is good for predictable sequences, but most things logic wise it fails as it does not know implementation.

>ChatGPT (mainly the UI) set a bad example, AI has been way more helpful to me for learning Go than going on Google or reading official docs, but not ChatGPT and rather Forefront, which can use GPT 3.5/4 or their own models but regardless they have a Internet Search function that uses the model to simply summarize dozens of actually real pages it found in a way that is easier for me to understand compared to the original, specially since I can keep chain-asking ""what is this/what is that"", and all from me explaining step-by-step with ""janky"" English and the full code. It also lists the pages it used so I can just click them and check it myself, (spoiler alert) it doesn't make as many mistakes as people think, even without search it does a great job understanding code, it won't usually solve more than basic problems and just keeps giving you different snippets to try but most of the time I end up fixing the issue because of the answers, even if the code doesn't work, I don't know how else to explain it. Of course my first language isn't English but I also learn almost entirely by example and docs don't usually have snippets for every little thing the code can do, it also sounds a bit advanced to me because it's just a lot of text with (programming/Go) terms that I usually don't use.

A weird asteroid has just gotten a little weirder.

We have known for a while that asteroid 3200 Phaethon acts like a comet. It brightens and forms a tail when it's near the Sun, and it is the source of the annual Geminid meteor shower, even though comets are responsible for most meteor showers. Scientists had blamed Phaethon's comet-like behavior on dust escaping from the asteroid as it's scorched by the Sun. However, a new study using two NASA solar observatories reveals that Phaethon's tail is not dusty at all but is actually made of sodium gas.

He acknowledged that there are many software tools in the college admissions space, including a program from Kira Talent that is used only for analyzing applicant interviews, but he is unaware of others that use AI to identify and score an applicant’s insights and skills.

According to a video on its website, the value proposition of Student Select is its ability to “synthesize large amounts of information from diverse sources”

I had the habit of drinking soda pop when I was thirsty, then I decided overnight (same day) that drinking a glass of water before would be smart. My goal was to switch to water when thirsty. So every time I wanted to have a pop it was okay as long as I had water first. I did not compromised and after a month my body didn't care anymore for pop all it wanted was water. It's been years

Community health workers followed an intervention algorithm to assess parental and family motivations and lifestyle goals and assist them in creating action plans at quarterly contacts, alternating in-person and telephone contact. Intervention behavioral targets included reduction of sugar-sweetened beverages, reduction of high calorie snacks, reduction of screen time, increase in fruits and vegetables, and increase in physical activity. Families would set a goal to make progress toward these targets and the community health worker would follow up with information about free or low-cost community resources that were available to support their goal.

High-frequency light is useful. The higher the frequency of light, the shorter its wavelength—and the shorter the wavelength, the smaller the objects and details the light can be used to see.

So violet light can show you smaller details than red light, for example, because it has a shorter wavelength. But to see really, really small things—

In her work, Lawrence has found some adults seem to ruminate in only one form, while most teens report ruminating in both verbal thoughts and mental imagery.

""That's why I like working with teenagers: If we can interrupt these processes early in development, maybe we can help these teens get to adulthood and not get stuck in these negative thinking patterns,"" Lawrence said.

Chemicals with known hazards are present in consumer products used regularly in the home and workplace. These products are an important source of chemical exposures. (1−5) Indeed, chemical exposures from use of consumer products are often higher than environmentally mediated, far-field exposures. (2,6) Identifying product ingredients is the first step in assessing associated health risks and prioritizing products for reformulation based on hazard. However, the data gap created by nonexistent or incomplete regulatory requirements for ingredient disclosure complicates even this initial identification step.

based their findings on the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, making it unlikely that humans might live forever any time soon – but the team thinks that the work could be developed to eventually help the human body age in a healthier way.

By 'rewiring' the yeast cells, the researchers were able to boost their lifespan by 82 percent on average. It's a promising development in the control of cellular aging and treating age-related conditions.

U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy wants the nation to see loneliness as one of the top health challenges, issuing an advisory warning on Tuesday about what he sees as a threat to Americans' health and well-being.

Why it matters: Studies have estimated that the impact of social isolation on mortality is similar to that caused by smoking up to 15 cigarettes a day, according to the advisory.

The free exhibition, running until 30 June at the Arcade in Bush House, showcases emerging applications for AI that shape our everyday lives. Presented in collaboration with King’s Culture, the research featured in the exhibition explores possibilities for the use of AI across society – from the NHS and the justice system to driverless cars, facial recognition, national intelligence and security, and the creative industries.

Opening the evening, Professor Michael Luck, Director of King’s Institute for Artificial Intelligence, spoke about the pace and scale of AI development in recent months. He celebrated the expertise and breadth of AI research currently taking place across King’s, including researchers dedicated to exploring the societal, legal and ethical implications of these emerging technologies. Many of the topics will be further explored in the Festival of Artificial Intelligence, running from 24 – 28 May alongside the exhibition that will bring together speakers, exhibits, performances, demos and screenings in a programme of public events.

While fears of AI replacing human workers have sykrocketed since OpenAI released its game-changing ChatGPT software last year, this appears to be one of the first times a company has been this straightforward about its plans to do exactly that. IBM.

That doesn't, however, mean that this is the first time it's happened.

Sophisticated computer algorithms used to set prices in online marketplaces put consumers at risk of collusion among sellers, according to a study today [thurs] from computer scientists at the Oxford Internet Institute and Imperial College.

Widespread use of intelligent algorithmics and dynamic pricing by online retailers, puts the public at risk of ‘adversarial collusion’, maintains Dr Luc Rocher, lead author of the paper, ‘Adversarial Competition and Collusion in Algorithmic Markets’.

17spsz6,1,2023-11-11,Cruise to Nowhere - Part 1,u/the_unknown_ghost,creepypasta,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/17spsz6/cruise_to_nowhere_part_1/," Have you ever had that feeling that something is just to good to be true? Well someone once told me that when something is too good to be true, then it usually is to good to be true.   


Well my mother always had this habit of entering every online contest she could find, whether it is a questionnaire or even a survey, the moment she sees  the words “contest” or “win” she couldn’t help herself. But she also has this “fire and forget system” where she will enter and completely forget about it. It usually ends up been a dud, but she does have luck in that way where she would win little prizes at times, I think the biggest prizes she has won so far would be a months worth of groceries, which is always welcome as we are a struggling family. My father died just after my younger brothers birth and he was a struggling musician, so he didn’t have any life policies or even a funeral plan in place, my mother worked as a waitress at the time, so everything just accumulated to more debt for her, she ended up working double shifts 7 days a week and the few hours she was at home she would drink until she passed out. As I was the eldest the responsibilities of taking care of our home and my younger brother fell upon me, luckily I have always been an A student at school and I just got a scholarship to go to varsity to study for a medical doctor.   


Another thing that always counted in my favour is that I always had great looks, so I always ended up getting photographic modelling work which helped us as the money was pretty decent and I could at-least afford to buy some basic necessities for our home and myself, and since half of my mothers money went into alcohol and cigarettes it made things really tight at home, but it could have been worse, considering that she was there when my father was mutilated and murdered for a packet of smokes. She saw everything, the robbers didn’t just rob him, they tortured him and by the time the police arrived he was unrecognisable.   


My brother is 16 now and he is very sporty, he excels at every sport he tries and he keeps winning prizes, which makes me proud of him, but it also made him a bit over confident and arrogant, I myself am a 19 year old girl and I will be starting my first semester at the best medical school in my country next year.   


Let me tell you about the town where I live, I live in a small town just about 30km from the nearest city, and as we can’t afford boarding school my brother and myself always had to get up early in the morning and make it to the main road and hope someone would give us a ride to school, the mornings were the easy part of the day, it is in the afternoons that we really struggled and we have learned to just walk up the mountain after school as we got a better chance of getting home, some days we would get lucky and someone would pick us up, but other days it would take us hours to walk home.   


That’s a bit about my life.   


Now let me tell you what happened to us, so I finished school last year, but because I didn’t want my brother to go down alone I would still go down to the city with him daily, and I used this year to try and make extra money doing part time work in the city while my brother was at school. So on the last day of school for the year I met him at our usual spot and we decided to start making our way up the mountain when this really expensive car stopped next to us, I don’t really know much about cars as I’m more into my modelling and medical stuff, but if you see a long black sedan with tinted windows and shiny mags pull up you know that you are either in trouble, or you got very lucky.   


So the car pulled up next to us and this tall blonde well dressed, well groomed middle age man got out and looked at us. Aren’t you Zoe and Jean Clarke?   
Zoe. “Depends who is asking and why.”  
Man. “Relax, I’m here to deliver a prize to your family, would you guys like a ride home?”  
Zoe. “Um, a prize?”   
Man. “Yes. “ smiling. “Your family won the family of the year contest.”  
Zoe. “Oh okay, what is the prize?”  
Man. “I’m sorry, but I can only disclose that to Mrs Clarke.”  
Zoe. “You mean Miss.”  
Man. “Oh I apologise, I didn’t realise she got divorced. “  
Zoe. “Widowed.”  
Man. “I apologise and I’m sorry for your loss, now would you please get in? I’m on a rather tight schedule.”  
My brother and I look at each other and he just shrugs and gets in the back, I take a seat at the front and fasten my seatbelt. Honestly I am pretty thankful for this ride as it is very hot today, not that it’s ever not warm in South Africa.   


So the man gets in and he offers us each a bottle of cold water which we gladly accept as we are both dying of thirst and then without another word he starts the car and off we went, you know when you walk the same road every day you actually stop noticing the scenery and you just focus on where you are walking, that is how my brother and I have become, we stopped even noticing anything any-more, but today it was like as if for the first time ever we could enjoy the scenery again and the beauty of nature, but as I got lost in though the car came to a standstill and the man turned off the ignition. I look up to see that we arrived at my mothers work place.   


Man. “You two wait here, I will go fetch your mother and then we can all go talk at your house.”  
We both sit in the car stunned, how did he even know where mom works? Oh well, with all these contest and surveys she’s always filling out you never know.   


We watch on as he walks over to the owner and speaks to the owner, we can see the owner arguing with him and shaking his ear, but then this strange man pulls something out of his pocket and hands it to the owner, the owner just goes pale and he becomes docile at once and goes inside, after a few minutes he comes out with our mother and we can see him handing her a thick envelope and shaking her hand, she just smiles and gives him a tight hug. Then her and the man comes over and they both get into the car.   


Zoe. “Hi mom.”  
Mom. “Hi kids.”  
Jean. In his usual arrogant tone. “Hi mom.”  
Zoe. “Mom, what just happened?”  
Mom. “Oh nothing, James just gave me a years worth of wages and said to have fun and he will see us when we get back.”  
Now I am very confused. “A years wages? See us when we get back.”  
Man. “Don’t worry about it, I will explain everything at your house.”  
Just then we pulled into the driveway and we all went inside.   


The man grabs a cooler box out of the drunk and he joins us on the veranda, he then first takes out a bottle of wine and then 4 glasses, but then he stops and looks in the direction of the gate and back at me. “Zoe, I think you might want to get that.”  
Just then I heard a voice calling my name at the gate. “Zoe!!! Zoe!!!! “   
I get up and grab the gate keys to let Chloe in, now Chloe is my best friend, but Chloe is not her real name, she picked the name Chloe because she said it rhymes with Zoe, she use to be a boy, but she is a transgender girl now, and honestly if she had to enter modelling I would quit, she actually got a scholarship to go and study psychiatry.   


So as Chloe and I get back inside the man is sitting on the one chair by the table with a huge grin on his face. He poured 5 glasses of dry red wine and everyone seems to be waiting in anticipation.   
Man, “well, now that we are all here I guess I can tell you what your big prize is.”  
Jean. “Let me guess, a years worth of groceries.” Still in his arrogant sarcastic tone.”  
Mom. “Stop it, don’t be rude.”  
Man. “No, well that as well. But you guys, the 4 of you won an epic cruise to everywhere and nowhere. “  
Chloe. “Wait, that doesn’t make any sense at all, everywhere and nowhere?”  


Now have you ever had that feeling that something is wrong? Terribly wrong? Like first of all it’s too good to be true, and yet nothing makes sense?” Well that’s the feeling I have right now, and looking back, I wish I went with my instincts.  


Man. “Yes, you will go everywhere and stay nowhere. Congratulations.”  
So we all take our wine glasses and cheers and take a sip. “ I’m still feeling uneasy about the whole thing. But I decided to keep quiet for my moms sake, she’s been working for years without even so much as 1 day break. And I could see that she was really excited for this.   
Mom. “So how long is this cruise for?”  
Man. “Oh just a couple of months or so. Don’t worry, you will have the time of your LIFE.” The way he said LIFE, with an almost creepy voice gave me the chills.  
But hey, it’s a cruise, the worst that can happen is the ship can sink, right?”  
Man. “And don’t worry about bringing anything, everything will be provided for you on the cruise, it’s an all inclusive cruise, even your clothing will be provided. We already got your sizes and everything, so your cabin will be fully stocked, and the best part is all food and drinks are included in your package. “ then he looks at my brother. “And since it’s in international waters, there is no age limit stopping you from enjoying yourself.”  
Mom. “I don’t think I want him to start drinking yet.”  
Claude looking at my mom, you can see he is furious now. “Sure mom, you already drink enough for us all.”  
Zoe. “Stop it now!”   
Mom. “It’s okay, he is right.” I can see she is almost in tears.   
Man. “Anyway, you guys can celebrate tonight, but be ready by 0:00 (midnight) that is when your driver will collect you. “   
Chloe. “Midnight?”  
Man. “Yes, your cruise leaves at 3:33am.”  
Zoe. “You do realise that we would never make it in time.”  
Man. “Relax, our driver has never missed.”  
Jean. “Frowning now. “Never missed.”  
Man. Looking at his wrist. “Oh my, look at the time, I got to be on my way.” And he gets up and walks out. I get up to follow him, but when I get to the gate both him and his car are gone. As I look around in confusion I feel a cold chill run down my back, nobody is this fast, I was just a few seconds behind him.  


I get back to find the group already in the second bottle of wine, it seems this strange man left is 6 bottles, so I join in, more out of nervousness, but soon the wine hits me and I fell asleep on the couch. But just as I start to fall into a deep sleep my mom shakes me awake.   
Mom. “Zoe, we got to get ready, the driver will be here shortly.”  
Zoe. “Mom, are you sure you want to go?”  
Mom, “Of-course we are going. It’s a free holiday.”  
Zoe. “But mom, doesn’t something feel off about this whole thing?”  
Mom, “of course, but I spoke to the neighbour and she said she will check on the house for us.”  
Zoe. “Not that, this holiday.”  
Mom. “Yeah, a fee all inclusive holiday? It’s about time we won a big prize like this.”  
Zoe. “But mom, can you remember…”  
Just then I get interrupted by a car hooting st the gate.   
Before I could say anything else an excited Chloe grabs my hand and yanks me to my feet, “let’s go sleepy head.”  
My mom locks up and we all get to the car waiting for us. It’s another black car similar to the first one, but this time it is a pale blonde woman driving it. She speaks to us in an almost hypnotic voice, “welcome, please get in, we have a long way to go.”  
Claude. “No shit. Not sure how we are going to make an 8 hour drive in 3:33.”  
Woman. “I am the best driver there is.”  
Claude. “Okay transporter. “  
My mom, Claude and Chloe shuffled into the back and I decide to hop in the front seat again.   


But soon after I got in a fell asleep again just to be awoken by this strange woman. “We have arrived.”  
I look around to the back to find the others also fell asleep, they are all yawning now and stretching.   


We shuffle out of the car to find an empty peer with a huge cruise ship waiting for us.   
Zoe. “This is strange, where is everyone else?”  
Woman. “Already on-board, we are a minute late. So off you go.”  
We make our way hesitantly into the ship to be greeted by an annoyed looking crew member, “you are a minute late.”  
Zoe. “Sorry, we were not the ones driving.”  
I then look around to find the door we entered through was already closed behind us.   
Crew. “Follow me please, I will show you to your cabins.”  
Chloe. “Cabins? That means we get more then one?”  
Crew. “You were each assigned your own individual cabin.”  


I could see this crew member wasn’t the talking type, so I stopped asking questions. We follow him down the hall, up the stairs into what seems to be the most beautiful love I’ve ever seen.   


The stairs seems to be made out of pure crystal and even the lights seem to be made out of crystal. He leads us over to a desk that says “Guest Services” where they immediately hand us each a blue card with our names and photographs on it.   
Mom. “How did you get our photographs?”  
Guest service associate. “We got them after you entered the contest.”  
Claude. “So you were spying on us?”  
Zoe. “Relax, they probably just did a social media survey on each of us.”  
Chloe. “I bet.” I can hear the disbelief in her voice.   


I look around the lobby and I see a whole bunch of people at different tables chattering away and enjoying different drinks, then I notice a table with 2 really beautiful woman sitting, they look to be about my age, but one has long blonde hair and blue eyes and she is wearing a long white dress, and the other one has long red hair and green eyes, and she seems to be wearing a similar dress to the other one, just hers is red. Then another table caught my eye, at it there is a slender beautiful lady sitting, she had long black hair, and is wearing a body hugging black evening dress, she has these sharp blue eyes, almost cat like, and talking about cats, she has a black cat laying in her shoulders just staring back at me, I couldn’t help but notice that she was sipping from a glass of red wine, then she looks back at me and lifts her glass and gives me a nod. “

Then another table caught my eye, at it there is a slender beautiful lady sitting, she had long black hair, and is wearing a body hugging black evening dress, she has these sharp blue eyes, almost cat like, and talking about cats, she has a black cat laying in her shoulders just staring back at me, I couldn’t help but notice that she was sipping from a glass of red wine, then she looks back at me and lifts her glass and gives me a nod. “

Well someone once told me that when something is too good to be true, then it usually is to good to be true.   


Well my mother always had this habit of entering every online contest she could find, whether it is a questionnaire or even a survey, the moment she sees  the words “contest” or “win” she couldn’t help herself. But she also has this “fire and forget system” where she will enter and completely forget about it. It usually ends up been a dud, but she does have luck in that way where she would win little prizes at times, I think the biggest prizes she has won so far would be a months worth of groceries, which is always welcome as we are a struggling family. My father died just after my younger brothers birth and he was a struggling musician, so he didn’t have any life policies or even a funeral plan in place, my mother worked as a waitress at the time, so everything just accumulated to more debt for her, she ended up working double shifts 7 days a week and the few hours she was at home she would drink until she passed out. As I was the eldest the responsibilities of taking care of our home and my younger brother fell upon me, luckily I have always been an A student at school and I just got a scholarship to go to varsity to study for a medical doctor.   


Another thing that always counted in my favour is that I always had great looks, so I always ended up getting photographic modelling work which helped us as the money was pretty decent and I could at-least afford to buy some basic necessities for our home and myself, and since half of my mothers money went into alcohol and cigarettes it made things really tight at home, but it could have been worse, considering that she was there when my father was mutilated and murdered for a packet of smokes. She saw everything, the robbers didn’t just rob him, they tortured him and by the time the police arrived he was unrecognisable.   


My brother is 16 now and he is very sporty, he excels at every sport he tries and he keeps winning prizes, which makes me proud of him, but it also made him a bit over confident and arrogant, I myself am a 19 year old girl and I will be starting my first semester at the best medical school in my country next year.   


Let me tell you about the town where I live, I live in a small town just about 30km from the nearest city, and as we can’t afford boarding school my brother and myself always had to get up early in the morning and make it to the main road and hope someone would give us a ride to school, the mornings were the easy part of the day, it is in the afternoons that we really struggled and we have learned to just walk up the mountain after school as we got a better chance of getting home, some days we would get lucky and someone would pick us up, but other days it would take us hours to walk home.   


That’s a bit about my life.   


Now let me tell you what happened to us, so I finished school last year, but because I didn’t want my brother to go down alone I would still go down to the city with him daily, and I used this year to try and make extra money doing part time work in the city while my brother was at school. So on the last day of school for the year I met him at our usual spot and we decided to start making our way up the mountain when this really expensive car stopped next to us, I don’t really know much about cars as I’m more into my modelling and medical stuff, but if you see a long black sedan with tinted windows and shiny mags pull up you know that you are either in trouble, or you got very lucky.   


So the car pulled up next to us and this tall blonde well dressed, well groomed middle age man got out and looked at us. Aren’t you Zoe and Jean Clarke?   
Zoe. “Depends who is asking and why.”  
Man. “Relax, I’m here to deliver a prize to your family, would you guys like a ride home?”  
Zoe. “Um, a prize?”   
Man. “Yes. “ smiling. “Your family won the family of the year contest.”  
Zoe. “Oh okay, what is the prize?”  
Man. “I’m sorry, but I can only disclose that to Mrs Clarke.”  
Zoe. “You mean Miss.”  
Man. “Oh I apologise, I didn’t realise she got divorced. “  
Zoe. “Widowed.”  
Man. “I apologise and I’m sorry for your loss, now would you please get in? I’m on a rather tight schedule.”  
My brother and I look at each other and he just shrugs and gets in the back, I take a seat at the front and fasten my seatbelt. Honestly I am pretty thankful for this ride as it is very hot today, not that it’s ever not warm in South Africa.   


So the man gets in and he offers us each a bottle of cold water which we gladly accept as we are both dying of thirst and then without another word he starts the car and off we went, you know when you walk the same road every day you actually stop noticing the scenery and you just focus on where you are walking, that is how my brother and I have become, we stopped even noticing anything any-more, but today it was like as if for the first time ever we could enjoy the scenery again and the beauty of nature, but as I got lost in though the car came to a standstill and the man turned off the ignition. I look up to see that we arrived at my mothers work place.   


Man. “You two wait here, I will go fetch your mother and then we can all go talk at your house.”  
We both sit in the car stunned, how did he even know where mom works? Oh well, with all these contest and surveys she’s always filling out you never know.   


We watch on as he walks over to the owner and speaks to the owner, we can see the owner arguing with him and shaking his ear, but then this strange man pulls something out of his pocket and hands it to the owner, the owner just goes pale and he becomes docile at once and goes inside, after a few minutes he comes out with our mother and we can see him handing her a thick envelope and shaking her hand, she just smiles and gives him a tight hug. Then her and the man comes over and they both get into the car.   


Zoe. “Hi mom.”  
Mom. “Hi kids.”  
Jean. In his usual arrogant tone. “Hi mom.”  
Zoe. “Mom, what just happened?”  
Mom. “Oh nothing, James just gave me a years worth of wages and said to have fun and he will see us when we get back.”  
Now I am very confused. “A years wages? See us when we get back.”  
Man. “Don’t worry about it, I will explain everything at your house.”  
Just then we pulled into the driveway and we all went inside.   


The man grabs a cooler box out of the drunk and he joins us on the veranda, he then first takes out a bottle of wine and then 4 glasses, but then he stops and looks in the direction of the gate and back at me. “Zoe, I think you might want to get that.”  
Just then I heard a voice calling my name at the gate. “Zoe!!! Zoe!!!! “   
I get up and grab the gate keys to let Chloe in, now Chloe is my best friend, but Chloe is not her real name, she picked the name Chloe because she said it rhymes with Zoe, she use to be a boy, but she is a transgender girl now, and honestly if she had to enter modelling I would quit, she actually got a scholarship to go and study psychiatry.   


So as Chloe and I get back inside the man is sitting on the one chair by the table with a huge grin on his face. He poured 5 glasses of dry red wine and everyone seems to be waiting in anticipation.   
Man, “well, now that we are all here I guess I can tell you what your big prize is.”  
Jean. “Let me guess, a years worth of groceries.” Still in his arrogant sarcastic tone.”  
Mom. “Stop it, don’t be rude.”  
Man. “No, well that as well. But you guys, the 4 of you won an epic cruise to everywhere and nowhere. “  
Chloe. “Wait, that doesn’t make any sense at all, everywhere and nowhere?”  


Now have you ever had that feeling that something is wrong? Terribly wrong? Like first of all it’s too good to be true, and yet nothing makes sense?” Well that’s the feeling I have right now, and looking back, I wish I went with my instincts.  


Man. “Yes, you will go everywhere and stay nowhere. Congratulations.”  
So we all take our wine glasses and cheers and take a sip. “ I’m still feeling uneasy about the whole thing. But I decided to keep quiet for my moms sake, she’s been working for years without even so much as 1 day break. And I could see that she was really excited for this.   
Mom. “So how long is this cruise for?”  
Man. “Oh just a couple of months or so. Don’t worry, you will have the time of your LIFE.” The way he said LIFE, with an almost creepy voice gave me the chills.  
But hey, it’s a cruise, the worst that can happen is the ship can sink, right?”  
Man. “And don’t worry about bringing anything, everything will be provided for you on the cruise, it’s an all inclusive cruise, even your clothing will be provided. We already got your sizes and everything, so your cabin will be fully stocked, and the best part is all food and drinks are included in your package. “ then he looks at my brother. “And since it’s in international waters, there is no age limit stopping you from enjoying yourself.”  
Mom. “I don’t think I want him to start drinking yet.”  
Claude looking at my mom, you can see he is furious now. “Sure mom, you already drink enough for us all.”  
Zoe. “Stop it now!”   
Mom. “It’s okay, he is right.” I can see she is almost in tears.   
Man. “Anyway, you guys can celebrate tonight, but be ready by 0:00 (midnight) that is when your driver will collect you. “   
Chloe. “Midnight?”  
Man. “Yes, your cruise leaves at 3:33am.”  
Zoe. “You do realise that we would never make it in time.”  
Man. “Relax, our driver has never missed.”  
Jean. “Frowning now. “Never missed.”  
Man. Looking at his wrist. “Oh my, look at the time, I got to be on my way.” And he gets up and walks out. I get up to follow him, but when I get to the gate both him and his car are gone. As I look around in confusion I feel a cold chill run down my back, nobody is this fast, I was just a few seconds behind him.  


I get back to find the group already in the second bottle of wine, it seems this strange man left is 6 bottles, so I join in, more out of nervousness, but soon the wine hits me and I fell asleep on the couch. But just as I start to fall into a deep sleep my mom shakes me awake.   
Mom. “Zoe, we got to get ready, the driver will be here shortly.”  
Zoe. “Mom, are you sure you want to go?”  
Mom, “Of-course we are going. It’s a free holiday.”  
Zoe. “But mom, doesn’t something feel off about this whole thing?”  
Mom, “of course, but I spoke to the neighbour and she said she will check on the house for us.”  
Zoe. “Not that, this holiday.”  
Mom. “Yeah, a fee all inclusive holiday? It’s about time we won a big prize like this.”  
Zoe. “But mom, can you remember…”  
Just then I get interrupted by a car hooting st the gate.   
Before I could say anything else an excited Chloe grabs my hand and yanks me to my feet, “let’s go sleepy head.”  
My mom locks up and we all get to the car waiting for us. It’s another black car similar to the first one, but this time it is a pale blonde woman driving it. She speaks to us in an almost hypnotic voice, “welcome, please get in, we have a long way to go.”  
Claude. “No shit. Not sure how we are going to make an 8 hour drive in 3:33.”  
Woman. “I am the best driver there is.”  
Claude. “Okay transporter. “  
My mom, Claude and Chloe shuffled into the back and I decide to hop in the front seat again.   


But soon after I got in a fell asleep again just to be awoken by this strange woman. “We have arrived.”  
I look around to the back to find the others also fell asleep, they are all yawning now and stretching.   


We shuffle out of the car to find an empty peer with a huge cruise ship waiting for us.   
Zoe. “This is strange, where is everyone else?”  
Woman. “Already on-board, we are a minute late. So off you go.”  
We make our way hesitantly into the ship to be greeted by an annoyed looking crew member, “you are a minute late.”  
Zoe. “Sorry, we were not the ones driving.”  
I then look around to find the door we entered through was already closed behind us.   
Crew. “Follow me please, I will show you to your cabins.”  
Chloe. “Cabins? That means we get more then one?”  
Crew. “You were each assigned your own individual cabin.”  


I could see this crew member wasn’t the talking type, so I stopped asking questions. We follow him down the hall, up the stairs into what seems to be the most beautiful love I’ve ever seen.   


The stairs seems to be made out of pure crystal and even the lights seem to be made out of crystal. He leads us over to a desk that says “Guest Services” where they immediately hand us each a blue card with our names and photographs on it.   
Mom. “How did you get our photographs?”  
Guest service associate. “We got them after you entered the contest.”  
Claude. “So you were spying on us?”  
Zoe. “Relax, they probably just did a social media survey on each of us.”  
Chloe. “I bet.” I can hear the disbelief in her voice.   


I look around the lobby and I see a whole bunch of people at different tables chattering away and enjoying different drinks, then I notice a table with 2 really beautiful woman sitting, they look to be about my age, but one has long blonde hair and blue eyes and she is wearing a long white dress, and the other one has long red hair and green eyes, and she seems to be wearing a similar dress to the other one, just hers is red.

Another thing that always counted in my favour is that I always had great looks, so I always ended up getting photographic modelling work which helped us as the money was pretty decent and I could at-least afford to buy some basic necessities for our home and myself, and since half of my mothers money went into alcohol and cigarettes it made things really tight at home, but it could have been worse, considering that she was there when my father was mutilated and murdered for a packet of smokes. She saw everything, the robbers didn’t just rob him, they tortured him and by the time the police arrived he was unrecognisable.   
My brother is 16 now and he is very sporty, he excels at every sport he tries and he keeps winning prizes, which makes me proud of him, but it also made him a bit over confident and arrogant, I myself am a 19 year old girl and I will be starting my first semester at the best medical school in my country next year.   
Let me tell you about the town where I live, I live in a small town just about 30km from the nearest city, and as we can’t afford boarding school my brother and myself always had to get up early in the morning and make it to the main road and hope someone would give us a ride to school, the mornings were the easy part of the day, it is in the afternoons that we really struggled and we have learned to just walk up the mountain after school as we got a better chance of getting home, some days we would get lucky and someone would pick us up, but other days it would take us hours to walk home.   
That’s a bit about my life.   
Now let me tell you what happened to us, so I finished school last year, but because I didn’t want my brother to go down alone I would still go down to the city with him daily, and I used this year to try and make extra money doing part time work in the city while my brother was at school. So on the last day of school for the year I met him at our usual spot and we decided to start making our way up the mountain when this really expensive car stopped next to us, I don’t really know much about cars as I’m more into my modelling and medical stuff, but if you see a long black sedan with tinted windows and shiny mags pull up you know that you are either in trouble, or you got very lucky.   
So the car pulled up next to us and this tall blonde well dressed, well groomed middle age man got out and looked at us. Aren’t you Zoe and Jean Clarke?   
Zoe. “Depends who is asking and why.”  
Man. “Relax, I’m here to deliver a prize to your family, would you guys like a ride home?”  
Zoe. “Um, a prize?”   
Man. “Yes. “ smiling. “Your family won the family of the year contest.”  
Zoe. “Oh okay, what is the prize?”  
Man. “I’m sorry, but I can only disclose that to Mrs Clarke.”  
Zoe. “You mean Miss.”  
Man. “Oh I apologise, I didn’t realise she got divorced. “  
Zoe. “Widowed.”  
Man. “I apologise and I’m sorry for your loss, now would you please get in? I’m on a rather tight schedule.”  
My brother and I look at each other and he just shrugs and gets in the back, I take a seat at the front and fasten my seatbelt. Honestly I am pretty thankful for this ride as it is very hot today, not that it’s ever not warm in South Africa.   
So the man gets in and he offers us each a bottle of cold water which we gladly accept as we are both dying of thirst and then without another word he starts the car and off we went, you know when you walk the same road every day you actually stop noticing the scenery and you just focus on where you are walking, that is how my brother and I have become, we stopped even noticing anything any-more, but today it was like as if for the first time ever we could enjoy the scenery again and the beauty of nature, but as I got lost in though the car came to a standstill and the man turned off the ignition. I look up to see that we arrived at my mothers work place.   
Man. “You two wait here, I will go fetch your mother and then we can all go talk at your house.”  
We both sit in the car stunned, how did he even know where mom works? Oh well, with all these contest and surveys she’s always filling out you never know.   
We watch on as he walks over to the owner and speaks to the owner, we can see the owner arguing with him and shaking his ear, but then this strange man pulls something out of his pocket and hands it to the owner, the owner just goes pale and he becomes docile at once and goes inside, after a few minutes he comes out with our mother and we can see him handing her a thick envelope and shaking her hand, she just smiles and gives him a tight hug. Then her and the man comes over and they both get into the car.   
Zoe. “Hi mom.”  
Mom. “Hi kids.”  
Jean. In his usual arrogant tone. “Hi mom.”  
Zoe. “Mom, what just happened?”  
Mom. “Oh nothing, James just gave me a years worth of wages and said to have fun and he will see us when we get back.”  
Now I am very confused. “A years wages? See us when we get back.”  
Man. “Don’t worry about it, I will explain everything at your house.”  
Just then we pulled into the driveway and we all went inside.   
The man grabs a cooler box out of the drunk and he joins us on the veranda, he then first takes out a bottle of wine and then 4 glasses, but then he stops and looks in the direction of the gate and back at me. “Zoe, I think you might want to get that.”  
Just then I heard a voice calling my name at the gate. “Zoe!!! Zoe!!!! “   
I get up and grab the gate keys to let Chloe in, now Chloe is my best friend, but Chloe is not her real name, she picked the name Chloe because she said it rhymes with Zoe, she use to be a boy, but she is a transgender girl now, and honestly if she had to enter modelling I would quit, she actually got a scholarship to go and study psychiatry.   
So as Chloe and I get back inside the man is sitting on the one chair by the table with a huge grin on his face. He poured 5 glasses of dry red wine and everyone seems to be waiting in anticipation.   
Man, “well, now that we are all here I guess I can tell you what your big prize is.”  
Jean. “Let me guess, a years worth of groceries.” Still in his arrogant sarcastic tone.”  
Mom. “Stop it, don’t be rude.”  
Man. “No, well that as well. But you guys, the 4 of you won an epic cruise to everywhere and nowhere. “  
Chloe. “Wait, that doesn’t make any sense at all, everywhere and nowhere?”  
Now have you ever had that feeling that something is wrong? Terribly wrong? Like first of all it’s too good to be true, and yet nothing makes sense?” Well that’s the feeling I have right now, and looking back, I wish I went with my instincts.  
Man. “Yes, you will go everywhere and stay nowhere. Congratulations.”  
So we all take our wine glasses and cheers and take a sip. “ I’m still feeling uneasy about the whole thing. But I decided to keep quiet for my moms sake, she’s been working for years without even so much as 1 day break. And I could see that she was really excited for this.   
Mom. “So how long is this cruise for?”  
Man. “Oh just a couple of months or so. Don’t worry, you will have the time of your LIFE.” The way he said LIFE, with an almost creepy voice gave me the chills.  
But hey, it’s a cruise, the worst that can happen is the ship can sink, right?”  
Man. “And don’t worry about bringing anything, everything will be provided for you on the cruise, it’s an all inclusive cruise, even your clothing will be provided. We already got your sizes and everything, so your cabin will be fully stocked, and the best part is all food and drinks are included in your package. “ then he looks at my brother. “And since it’s in international waters, there is no age limit stopping you from enjoying yourself.”  
Mom. “I don’t think I want him to start drinking yet.”  
Claude looking at my mom, you can see he is furious now. “Sure mom, you already drink enough for us all.”  
Zoe. “Stop it now!”   
Mom. “It’s okay, he is right.” I can see she is almost in tears.   
Man. “Anyway, you guys can celebrate tonight, but be ready by 0:00 (midnight) that is when your driver will collect you. “   
Chloe. “Midnight?”  
Man. “Yes, your cruise leaves at 3:33am.”  
Zoe. “You do realise that we would never make it in time.”  
Man. “Relax, our driver has never missed.”  
Jean. “Frowning now. “Never missed.”  
Man. Looking at his wrist. “Oh my, look at the time, I got to be on my way.” And he gets up and walks out. I get up to follow him, but when I get to the gate both him and his car are gone. As I look around in confusion I feel a cold chill run down my back, nobody is this fast, I was just a few seconds behind him.  
I get back to find the group already in the second bottle of wine, it seems this strange man left is 6 bottles, so I join in, more out of nervousness, but soon the wine hits me and I fell asleep on the couch. But just as I start to fall into a deep sleep my mom shakes me awake.   
Mom. “Zoe, we got to get ready, the driver will be here shortly.”  
Zoe. “Mom, are you sure you want to go?”  
Mom, “Of-course we are going. It’s a free holiday.”  
Zoe. “But mom, doesn’t something feel off about this whole thing?”  
Mom, “of course, but I spoke to the neighbour and she said she will check on the house for us.”  
Zoe. “Not that, this holiday.”  
Mom. “Yeah, a fee all inclusive holiday? It’s about time we won a big prize like this.”  
Zoe. “But mom, can you remember…”  
Just then I get interrupted by a car hooting st the gate.   
Before I could say anything else an excited Chloe grabs my hand and yanks me to my feet, “let’s go sleepy head.”  
My mom locks up and we all get to the car waiting for us. It’s another black car similar to the first one, but this time it is a pale blonde woman driving it. She speaks to us in an almost hypnotic voice, “welcome, please get in, we have a long way to go.”  
Claude. “No shit. Not sure how we are going to make an 8 hour drive in 3:33.”  
Woman. “I am the best driver there is.”  
Claude. “Okay transporter. “  
My mom, Claude and Chloe shuffled into the back and I decide to hop in the front seat again.   
But soon after I got in a fell asleep again just to be awoken by this strange woman. “We have arrived.”  
I look around to the back to find the others also fell asleep, they are all yawning now and stretching.   
We shuffle out of the car to find an empty peer with a huge cruise ship waiting for us.   
Zoe. “This is strange, where is everyone else?”  
Woman. “Already on-board, we are a minute late. So off you go.”  
We make our way hesitantly into the ship to be greeted by an annoyed looking crew member, “you are a minute late.”  
Zoe. “Sorry, we were not the ones driving.”  
I then look around to find the door we entered through was already closed behind us.   
Crew. “Follow me please, I will show you to your cabins.”  
Chloe. “Cabins? That means we get more then one?”  
Crew. “You were each assigned your own individual cabin.”  
I could see this crew member wasn’t the talking type, so I stopped asking questions. We follow him down the hall, up the stairs into what seems to be the most beautiful love I’ve ever seen.   
The stairs seems to be made out of pure crystal and even the lights seem to be made out of crystal. He leads us over to a desk that says “Guest Services” where they immediately hand us each a blue card with our names and photographs on it.   
Mom. “How did you get our photographs?”  
Guest service associate. “We got them after you entered the contest.”  
Claude. “So you were spying on us?”  
Zoe. “Relax, they probably just did a social media survey on each of us.”  
Chloe. “I bet.” I can hear the disbelief in her voice.   
I look around the lobby and I see a whole bunch of people at different tables chattering away and enjoying different drinks, then I notice a table with 2 really beautiful woman sitting, they look to be about my age, but one has long blonde hair and blue eyes and she is wearing a long white dress, and the other one has long red hair and green eyes, and she seems to be wearing a similar dress to the other one, just hers is red. Then another table caught my eye, at it there is a slender beautiful lady sitting, she had long black hair, and is wearing a body hugging black evening dress, she has these sharp blue eyes, almost cat like, and talking about cats, she has a black cat laying in her shoulders just staring back at me, I couldn’t help but notice that she was sipping from a glass of red wine, then she looks back at me and lifts her glass and gives me a nod. “

So the car pulled up next to us and this tall blonde well dressed, well groomed middle age man got out and looked at us. Aren’t you Zoe and Jean Clarke?   
Zoe. “Depends who is asking and why.”  
Man. “Relax, I’m here to deliver a prize to your family, would you guys like a ride home?”  
Zoe. “Um, a prize?”   
Man. “Yes. “ smiling. “Your family won the family of the year contest.”  
Zoe. “Oh okay, what is the prize?”  
Man. “I’m sorry, but I can only disclose that to Mrs Clarke.”  
Zoe. “You mean Miss.”  
Man. “Oh I apologise, I didn’t realise she got divorced. “  
Zoe. “Widowed.”  
Man. “I apologise and I’m sorry for your loss, now would you please get in? I’m on a rather tight schedule.”  
My brother and I look at each other and he just shrugs and gets in the back, I take a seat at the front and fasten my seatbelt. Honestly I am pretty thankful for this ride as it is very hot today, not that it’s ever not warm in South Africa.   


So the man gets in and he offers us each a bottle of cold water which we gladly accept as we are both dying of thirst and then without another word he starts the car and off we went, you know when you walk the same road every day you actually stop noticing the scenery and you just focus on where you are walking, that is how my brother and I have become, we stopped even noticing anything any-more, but today it was like as if for the first time ever we could enjoy the scenery again and the beauty of nature, but as I got lost in though the car came to a standstill and the man turned off the ignition. I look up to see that we arrived at my mothers work place.   


Man. “You two wait here, I will go fetch your mother and then we can all go talk at your house.”  
We both sit in the car stunned, how did he even know where mom works? Oh well, with all these contest and surveys she’s always filling out you never know.   


We watch on as he walks over to the owner and speaks to the owner, we can see the owner arguing with him and shaking his ear, but then this strange man pulls something out of his pocket and hands it to the owner, the owner just goes pale and he becomes docile at once and goes inside, after a few minutes he comes out with our mother and we can see him handing her a thick envelope and shaking her hand, she just smiles and gives him a tight hug. Then her and the man comes over and they both get into the car.   


Zoe. “Hi mom.”  
Mom. “Hi kids.”  
Jean. In his usual arrogant tone. “Hi mom.”  
Zoe. “Mom, what just happened?”  
Mom. “Oh nothing, James just gave me a years worth of wages and said to have fun and he will see us when we get back.”  
Now I am very confused. “A years wages? See us when we get back.”  
Man. “Don’t worry about it, I will explain everything at your house.”  
Just then we pulled into the driveway and we all went inside.   


The man grabs a cooler box out of the drunk and he joins us on the veranda, he then first takes out a bottle of wine and then 4 glasses, but then he stops and looks in the direction of the gate and back at me. “Zoe, I think you might want to get that.”  
Just then I heard a voice calling my name at the gate. “Zoe!!! Zoe!!!! “   
I get up and grab the gate keys to let Chloe in, now Chloe is my best friend, but Chloe is not her real name, she picked the name Chloe because she said it rhymes with Zoe, she use to be a boy, but she is a transgender girl now, and honestly if she had to enter modelling I would quit, she actually got a scholarship to go and study psychiatry.   


So as Chloe and I get back inside the man is sitting on the one chair by the table with a huge grin on his face. He poured 5 glasses of dry red wine and everyone seems to be waiting in anticipation.   
Man, “well, now that we are all here I guess I can tell you what your big prize is.”  
Jean. “Let me guess, a years worth of groceries.” Still in his arrogant sarcastic tone.”  
Mom. “Stop it, don’t be rude.”  
Man. “No, well that as well. But you guys, the 4 of you won an epic cruise to everywhere and nowhere. “  
Chloe. “Wait, that doesn’t make any sense at all, everywhere and nowhere?”  


Now have you ever had that feeling that something is wrong? Terribly wrong? Like first of all it’s too good to be true, and yet nothing makes sense?” Well that’s the feeling I have right now, and looking back, I wish I went with my instincts.  


Man. “Yes, you will go everywhere and stay nowhere. Congratulations.”  
So we all take our wine glasses and cheers and take a sip. “ I’m still feeling uneasy about the whole thing. But I decided to keep quiet for my moms sake, she’s been working for years without even so much as 1 day break. And I could see that she was really excited for this.   
Mom. “So how long is this cruise for?”  
Man. “Oh just a couple of months or so. Don’t worry, you will have the time of your LIFE.” The way he said LIFE, with an almost creepy voice gave me the chills.  
But hey, it’s a cruise, the worst that can happen is the ship can sink, right?”  
Man. “And don’t worry about bringing anything, everything will be provided for you on the cruise, it’s an all inclusive cruise, even your clothing will be provided. We already got your sizes and everything, so your cabin will be fully stocked, and the best part is all food and drinks are included in your package. “ then he looks at my brother. “And since it’s in international waters, there is no age limit stopping you from enjoying yourself.”  
Mom. “I don’t think I want him to start drinking yet.”  
Claude looking at my mom, you can see he is furious now. “Sure mom, you already drink enough for us all.”  
Zoe. “Stop it now!”   
Mom. “It’s okay, he is right.” I can see she is almost in tears.   
Man. “Anyway, you guys can celebrate tonight, but be ready by 0:00 (midnight) that is when your driver will collect you. “   
Chloe. “Midnight?”  
Man. “Yes, your cruise leaves at 3:33am.”  
Zoe. “You do realise that we would never make it in time.”  
Man. “Relax, our driver has never missed.”  
Jean. “Frowning now. “Never missed.”  
Man. Looking at his wrist. “Oh my, look at the time, I got to be on my way.” And he gets up and walks out. I get up to follow him, but when I get to the gate both him and his car are gone. As I look around in confusion I feel a cold chill run down my back, nobody is this fast, I was just a few seconds behind him.  


I get back to find the group already in the second bottle of wine, it seems this strange man left is 6 bottles, so I join in, more out of nervousness, but soon the wine hits me and I fell asleep on the couch. But just as I start to fall into a deep sleep my mom shakes me awake.   
Mom. “Zoe, we got to get ready, the driver will be here shortly.”  
Zoe. “Mom, are you sure you want to go?”  
Mom, “Of-course we are going. It’s a free holiday.”  
Zoe. “But mom, doesn’t something feel off about this whole thing?”  
Mom, “of course, but I spoke to the neighbour and she said she will check on the house for us.”  
Zoe. “Not that, this holiday.”  
Mom. “Yeah, a fee all inclusive holiday? It’s about time we won a big prize like this.”  
Zoe. “But mom, can you remember…”  
Just then I get interrupted by a car hooting st the gate.   
Before I could say anything else an excited Chloe grabs my hand and yanks me to my feet, “let’s go sleepy head.”  
My mom locks up and we all get to the car waiting for us. It’s another black car similar to the first one, but this time it is a pale blonde woman driving it. She speaks to us in an almost hypnotic voice, “welcome, please get in, we have a long way to go.”  
Claude. “No shit. Not sure how we are going to make an 8 hour drive in 3:33.”  
Woman. “I am the best driver there is.”  
Claude. “Okay transporter. “  
My mom, Claude and Chloe shuffled into the back and I decide to hop in the front seat again.   


But soon after I got in a fell asleep again just to be awoken by this strange woman. “We have arrived.”  
I look around to the back to find the others also fell asleep, they are all yawning now and stretching.   


We shuffle out of the car to find an empty peer with a huge cruise ship waiting for us.   
Zoe. “This is strange, where is everyone else?”  
Woman. “Already on-board, we are a minute late. So off you go.”  
We make our way hesitantly into the ship to be greeted by an annoyed looking crew member, “you are a minute late.”  
Zoe. “Sorry, we were not the ones driving.”  
I then look around to find the door we entered through was already closed behind us.   
Crew. “Follow me please, I will show you to your cabins.”  
Chloe. “Cabins? That means we get more then one?”  
Crew. “You were each assigned your own individual cabin.”  


I could see this crew member wasn’t the talking type, so I stopped asking questions. We follow him down the hall, up the stairs into what seems to be the most beautiful love I’ve ever seen.   


The stairs seems to be made out of pure crystal and even the lights seem to be made out of crystal. He leads us over to a desk that says “Guest Services” where they immediately hand us each a blue card with our names and photographs on it.   
Mom. “How did you get our photographs?”  
Guest service associate. “We got them after you entered the contest.”  
Claude. “So you were spying on us?”  
Zoe. “Relax, they probably just did a social media survey on each of us.”  
Chloe. “I bet.” I can hear the disbelief in her voice.   


I look around the lobby and I see a whole bunch of people at different tables chattering away and enjoying different drinks, then I notice a table with 2 really beautiful woman sitting, they look to be about my age, but one has long blonde hair and blue eyes and she is wearing a long white dress, and the other one has long red hair and green eyes, and she seems to be wearing a similar dress to the other one, just hers is red. Then another table caught my eye, at it there is a slender beautiful lady sitting, she had long black hair, and is wearing a body hugging black evening dress, she has these sharp blue eyes, almost cat like, and talking about cats, she has a black cat laying in her shoulders just staring back at me, I couldn’t help but notice that she was sipping from a glass of red wine, then she looks back at me and lifts her glass and gives me a nod. “

Well someone once told me that when something is too good to be true, then it usually is to good to be true.   
Well my mother always had this habit of entering every online contest she could find, whether it is a questionnaire or even a survey, the moment she sees  the words “contest” or “win” she couldn’t help herself. But she also has this “fire and forget system” where she will enter and completely forget about it. It usually ends up been a dud, but she does have luck in that way where she would win little prizes at times, I think the biggest prizes she has won so far would be a months worth of groceries, which is always welcome as we are a struggling family. My father died just after my younger brothers birth and he was a struggling musician, so he didn’t have any life policies or even a funeral plan in place, my mother worked as a waitress at the time, so everything just accumulated to more debt for her, she ended up working double shifts 7 days a week and the few hours she was at home she would drink until she passed out. As I was the eldest the responsibilities of taking care of our home and my younger brother fell upon me, luckily I have always been an A student at school and I just got a scholarship to go to varsity to study for a medical doctor.   
Another thing that always counted in my favour is that I always had great looks, so I always ended up getting photographic modelling work which helped us as the money was pretty decent and I could at-least afford to buy some basic necessities for our home and myself, and since half of my mothers money went into alcohol and cigarettes it made things really tight at home, but it could have been worse, considering that she was there when my father was mutilated and murdered for a packet of smokes. She saw everything, the robbers didn’t just rob him, they tortured him and by the time the police arrived he was unrecognisable.   
My brother is 16 now and he is very sporty, he excels at every sport he tries and he keeps winning prizes, which makes me proud of him, but it also made him a bit over confident and arrogant, I myself am a 19 year old girl and I will be starting my first semester at the best medical school in my country next year.   
Let me tell you about the town where I live, I live in a small town just about 30km from the nearest city, and as we can’t afford boarding school my brother and myself always had to get up early in the morning and make it to the main road and hope someone would give us a ride to school, the mornings were the easy part of the day, it is in the afternoons that we really struggled and we have learned to just walk up the mountain after school as we got a better chance of getting home, some days we would get lucky and someone would pick us up, but other days it would take us hours to walk home.

We watch on as he walks over to the owner and speaks to the owner, we can see the owner arguing with him and shaking his ear, but then this strange man pulls something out of his pocket and hands it to the owner, the owner just goes pale and he becomes docile at once and goes inside, after a few minutes he comes out with our mother and we can see him handing her a thick envelope and shaking her hand, she just smiles and gives him a tight hug. Then her and the man comes over and they both get into the car.   


Zoe. “Hi mom.”  
Mom. “Hi kids.”  
Jean. In his usual arrogant tone. “Hi mom.”  
Zoe. “Mom, what just happened?”  
Mom. “Oh nothing, James just gave me a years worth of wages and said to have fun and he will see us when we get back.”  
Now I am very confused. “A years wages? See us when we get back.”  
Man. “Don’t worry about it, I will explain everything at your house.”  
Just then we pulled into the driveway and we all went inside.   


The man grabs a cooler box out of the drunk and he joins us on the veranda, he then first takes out a bottle of wine and then 4 glasses, but then he stops and looks in the direction of the gate and back at me. “Zoe, I think you might want to get that.”  
Just then I heard a voice calling my name at the gate. “Zoe!!! Zoe!!!! “   
I get up and grab the gate keys to let Chloe in, now Chloe is my best friend, but Chloe is not her real name, she picked the name Chloe because she said it rhymes with Zoe, she use to be a boy, but she is a transgender girl now, and honestly if she had to enter modelling I would quit, she actually got a scholarship to go and study psychiatry.   


So as Chloe and I get back inside the man is sitting on the one chair by the table with a huge grin on his face. He poured 5 glasses of dry red wine and everyone seems to be waiting in anticipation.   
Man, “well, now that we are all here I guess I can tell you what your big prize is.”  
Jean. “Let me guess, a years worth of groceries.” Still in his arrogant sarcastic tone.”  
Mom. “Stop it, don’t be rude.”  
Man. “No, well that as well. But you guys, the 4 of you won an epic cruise to everywhere and nowhere. “  
Chloe. “Wait, that doesn’t make any sense at all, everywhere and nowhere?”  


Now have you ever had that feeling that something is wrong? Terribly wrong? Like first of all it’s too good to be true, and yet nothing makes sense?” Well that’s the feeling I have right now, and looking back, I wish I went with my instincts.  


Man. “Yes, you will go everywhere and stay nowhere. Congratulations.”  
So we all take our wine glasses and cheers and take a sip. “ I’m still feeling uneasy about the whole thing. But I decided to keep quiet for my moms sake, she’s been working for years without even so much as 1 day break. And I could see that she was really excited for this.   
Mom. “So how long is this cruise for?”  
Man. “Oh just a couple of months or so. Don’t worry, you will have the time of your LIFE.” The way he said LIFE, with an almost creepy voice gave me the chills.  
But hey, it’s a cruise, the worst that can happen is the ship can sink, right?”  
Man. “And don’t worry about bringing anything, everything will be provided for you on the cruise, it’s an all inclusive cruise, even your clothing will be provided. We already got your sizes and everything, so your cabin will be fully stocked, and the best part is all food and drinks are included in your package. “ then he looks at my brother. “And since it’s in international waters, there is no age limit stopping you from enjoying yourself.”  
Mom. “I don’t think I want him to start drinking yet.”  
Claude looking at my mom, you can see he is furious now. “Sure mom, you already drink enough for us all.”  
Zoe. “Stop it now!”   
Mom. “It’s okay, he is right.” I can see she is almost in tears.   
Man. “Anyway, you guys can celebrate tonight, but be ready by 0:00 (midnight) that is when your driver will collect you. “   
Chloe. “Midnight?”  
Man. “Yes, your cruise leaves at 3:33am.”  
Zoe. “You do realise that we would never make it in time.”  
Man. “Relax, our driver has never missed.”  
Jean. “Frowning now. “Never missed.”  
Man. Looking at his wrist. “Oh my, look at the time, I got to be on my way.” And he gets up and walks out. I get up to follow him, but when I get to the gate both him and his car are gone. As I look around in confusion I feel a cold chill run down my back, nobody is this fast, I was just a few seconds behind him.  


I get back to find the group already in the second bottle of wine, it seems this strange man left is 6 bottles, so I join in, more out of nervousness, but soon the wine hits me and I fell asleep on the couch. But just as I start to fall into a deep sleep my mom shakes me awake.   
Mom. “Zoe, we got to get ready, the driver will be here shortly.”  
Zoe. “Mom, are you sure you want to go?”  
Mom, “Of-course we are going. It’s a free holiday.”  
Zoe. “But mom, doesn’t something feel off about this whole thing?”  
Mom, “of course, but I spoke to the neighbour and she said she will check on the house for us.”  
Zoe. “Not that, this holiday.”  
Mom. “Yeah, a fee all inclusive holiday? It’s about time we won a big prize like this.”  
Zoe. “But mom, can you remember…”  
Just then I get interrupted by a car hooting st the gate.   
Before I could say anything else an excited Chloe grabs my hand and yanks me to my feet, “let’s go sleepy head.”  
My mom locks up and we all get to the car waiting for us. It’s another black car similar to the first one, but this time it is a pale blonde woman driving it. She speaks to us in an almost hypnotic voice, “welcome, please get in, we have a long way to go.”  
Claude. “No shit. Not sure how we are going to make an 8 hour drive in 3:33.”  
Woman. “I am the best driver there is.”  
Claude. “Okay transporter. “  
My mom, Claude and Chloe shuffled into the back and I decide to hop in the front seat again.   


But soon after I got in a fell asleep again just to be awoken by this strange woman. “We have arrived.”  
I look around to the back to find the others also fell asleep, they are all yawning now and stretching.   


We shuffle out of the car to find an empty peer with a huge cruise ship waiting for us.   
Zoe. “This is strange, where is everyone else?”  
Woman. “Already on-board, we are a minute late. So off you go.”  
We make our way hesitantly into the ship to be greeted by an annoyed looking crew member, “you are a minute late.”  
Zoe. “Sorry, we were not the ones driving.”  
I then look around to find the door we entered through was already closed behind us.   
Crew. “Follow me please, I will show you to your cabins.”  
Chloe. “Cabins? That means we get more then one?”  
Crew. “You were each assigned your own individual cabin.”  


I could see this crew member wasn’t the talking type, so I stopped asking questions. We follow him down the hall, up the stairs into what seems to be the most beautiful love I’ve ever seen.   


The stairs seems to be made out of pure crystal and even the lights seem to be made out of crystal. He leads us over to a desk that says “Guest Services” where they immediately hand us each a blue card with our names and photographs on it.   
Mom. “How did you get our photographs?”  
Guest service associate. “We got them after you entered the contest.”  
Claude. “So you were spying on us?”  
Zoe. “Relax, they probably just did a social media survey on each of us.”  
Chloe. “I bet.” I can hear the disbelief in her voice.   


I look around the lobby and I see a whole bunch of people at different tables chattering away and enjoying different drinks, then I notice a table with 2 really beautiful woman sitting, they look to be about my age, but one has long blonde hair and blue eyes and she is wearing a long white dress, and the other one has long red hair and green eyes, and she seems to be wearing a similar dress to the other one, just hers is red. Then another table caught my eye, at it there is a slender beautiful lady sitting, she had long black hair, and is wearing a body hugging black evening dress, she has these sharp blue eyes, almost cat like, and talking about cats, she has a black cat laying in her shoulders just staring back at me, I couldn’t help but notice that she was sipping from a glass of red wine, then she looks back at me and lifts her glass and gives me a nod. “

Well someone once told me that when something is too good to be true, then it usually is to good to be true.   


Well my mother always had this habit of entering every online contest she could find, whether it is a questionnaire or even a survey, the moment she sees  the words “contest” or “win” she couldn’t help herself. But she also has this “fire and forget system” where she will enter and completely forget about it. It usually ends up been a dud, but she does have luck in that way where she would win little prizes at times, I think the biggest prizes she has won so far would be a months worth of groceries, which is always welcome as we are a struggling family. My father died just after my younger brothers birth and he was a struggling musician, so he didn’t have any life policies or even a funeral plan in place, my mother worked as a waitress at the time, so everything just accumulated to more debt for her, she ended up working double shifts 7 days a week and the few hours she was at home she would drink until she passed out. As I was the eldest the responsibilities of taking care of our home and my younger brother fell upon me, luckily I have always been an A student at school and I just got a scholarship to go to varsity to study for a medical doctor.   


Another thing that always counted in my favour is that I always had great looks, so I always ended up getting photographic modelling work which helped us as the money was pretty decent and I could at-least afford to buy some basic necessities for our home and myself, and since half of my mothers money went into alcohol and cigarettes it made things really tight at home, but it could have been worse, considering that she was there when my father was mutilated and murdered for a packet of smokes. She saw everything, the robbers didn’t just rob him, they tortured him and by the time the police arrived he was unrecognisable.   


My brother is 16 now and he is very sporty, he excels at every sport he tries and he keeps winning prizes, which makes me proud of him, but it also made him a bit over confident and arrogant, I myself am a 19 year old girl and I will be starting my first semester at the best medical school in my country next year.   


Let me tell you about the town where I live, I live in a small town just about 30km from the nearest city, and as we can’t afford boarding school my brother and myself always had to get up early in the morning and make it to the main road and hope someone would give us a ride to school, the mornings were the easy part of the day, it is in the afternoons that we really struggled and we have learned to just walk up the mountain after school as we got a better chance of getting home, some days we would get lucky and someone would pick us up, but other days it would take us hours to walk home.   


That’s a bit about my life.   


Now let me tell you what happened to us, so I finished school last year, but because I didn’t want my brother to go down alone I would still go down to the city with him daily, and I used this year to try and make extra money doing part time work in the city while my brother was at school. So on the last day of school for the year I met him at our usual spot and we decided to start making our way up the mountain when this really expensive car stopped next to us, I don’t really know much about cars as I’m more into my modelling and medical stuff, but if you see a long black sedan with tinted windows and shiny mags pull up you know that you are either in trouble, or you got very lucky.   


So the car pulled up next to us and this tall blonde well dressed, well groomed middle age man got out and looked at us. Aren’t you Zoe and Jean Clarke?   
Zoe. “Depends who is asking and why.”  
Man. “Relax, I’m here to deliver a prize to your family, would you guys like a ride home?”  
Zoe. “Um, a prize?”   
Man. “Yes. “ smiling. “Your family won the family of the year contest.”  
Zoe. “Oh okay, what is the prize?”  
Man. “I’m sorry, but I can only disclose that to Mrs Clarke.”  
Zoe. “You mean Miss.”  
Man. “Oh I apologise, I didn’t realise she got divorced. “  
Zoe. “Widowed.”  
Man. “I apologise and I’m sorry for your loss, now would you please get in? I’m on a rather tight schedule.”  
My brother and I look at each other and he just shrugs and gets in the back, I take a seat at the front and fasten my seatbelt. Honestly I am pretty thankful for this ride as it is very hot today, not that it’s ever not warm in South Africa.   


So the man gets in and he offers us each a bottle of cold water which we gladly accept as we are both dying of thirst and then without another word he starts the car and off we went, you know when you walk the same road every day you actually stop noticing the scenery and you just focus on where you are walking, that is how my brother and I have become, we stopped even noticing anything any-more, but today it was like as if for the first time ever we could enjoy the scenery again and the beauty of nature, but as I got lost in though the car came to a standstill and the man turned off the ignition. I look up to see that we arrived at my mothers work place.   


Man. “You two wait here, I will go fetch your mother and then we can all go talk at your house.”  
We both sit in the car stunned, how did he even know where mom works? Oh well, with all these contest and surveys she’s always filling out you never know.

Now have you ever had that feeling that something is wrong? Terribly wrong? Like first of all it’s too good to be true, and yet nothing makes sense?” Well that’s the feeling I have right now, and looking back, I wish I went with my instincts.  
Man. “Yes, you will go everywhere and stay nowhere. Congratulations.”  
So we all take our wine glasses and cheers and take a sip. “ I’m still feeling uneasy about the whole thing. But I decided to keep quiet for my moms sake, she’s been working for years without even so much as 1 day break. And I could see that she was really excited for this.   
Mom. “So how long is this cruise for?”  
Man. “Oh just a couple of months or so. Don’t worry, you will have the time of your LIFE.” The way he said LIFE, with an almost creepy voice gave me the chills.  
But hey, it’s a cruise, the worst that can happen is the ship can sink, right?”  
Man. “And don’t worry about bringing anything, everything will be provided for you on the cruise, it’s an all inclusive cruise, even your clothing will be provided. We already got your sizes and everything, so your cabin will be fully stocked, and the best part is all food and drinks are included in your package. “ then he looks at my brother. “And since it’s in international waters, there is no age limit stopping you from enjoying yourself.”  
Mom. “I don’t think I want him to start drinking yet.”  
Claude looking at my mom, you can see he is furious now. “Sure mom, you already drink enough for us all.”  
Zoe. “Stop it now!”   
Mom. “It’s okay, he is right.” I can see she is almost in tears.   
Man. “Anyway, you guys can celebrate tonight, but be ready by 0:00 (midnight) that is when your driver will collect you. “   
Chloe. “Midnight?”  
Man. “Yes, your cruise leaves at 3:33am.”  
Zoe. “You do realise that we would never make it in time.”  
Man. “Relax, our driver has never missed.”  
Jean. “Frowning now. “Never missed.”  
Man. Looking at his wrist. “Oh my, look at the time, I got to be on my way.” And he gets up and walks out. I get up to follow him, but when I get to the gate both him and his car are gone. As I look around in confusion I feel a cold chill run down my back, nobody is this fast, I was just a few seconds behind him.  
I get back to find the group already in the second bottle of wine, it seems this strange man left is 6 bottles, so I join in, more out of nervousness, but soon the wine hits me and I fell asleep on the couch. But just as I start to fall into a deep sleep my mom shakes me awake.   
Mom. “Zoe, we got to get ready, the driver will be here shortly.”  
Zoe. “Mom, are you sure you want to go?”  
Mom, “Of-course we are going. It’s a free holiday.”  
Zoe. “But mom, doesn’t something feel off about this whole thing?”  
Mom, “of course, but I spoke to the neighbour and she said she will check on the house for us.”  
Zoe. “Not that, this holiday.”  
Mom. “Yeah, a fee all inclusive holiday? It’s about time we won a big prize like this.”  
Zoe. “But mom, can you remember…”  
Just then I get interrupted by a car hooting st the gate.   
Before I could say anything else an excited Chloe grabs my hand and yanks me to my feet, “let’s go sleepy head.”  
My mom locks up and we all get to the car waiting for us. It’s another black car similar to the first one, but this time it is a pale blonde woman driving it. She speaks to us in an almost hypnotic voice, “welcome, please get in, we have a long way to go.”  
Claude. “No shit. Not sure how we are going to make an 8 hour drive in 3:33.”  
Woman. “I am the best driver there is.”  
Claude. “Okay transporter. “  
My mom, Claude and Chloe shuffled into the back and I decide to hop in the front seat again.   
But soon after I got in a fell asleep again just to be awoken by this strange woman. “We have arrived.”  
I look around to the back to find the others also fell asleep, they are all yawning now and stretching.   
We shuffle out of the car to find an empty peer with a huge cruise ship waiting for us.   
Zoe. “This is strange, where is everyone else?”  
Woman. “Already on-board, we are a minute late. So off you go.”  
We make our way hesitantly into the ship to be greeted by an annoyed looking crew member, “you are a minute late.”  
Zoe. “Sorry, we were not the ones driving.”  
I then look around to find the door we entered through was already closed behind us.   
Crew. “Follow me please, I will show you to your cabins.”  
Chloe. “Cabins? That means we get more then one?”  
Crew. “You were each assigned your own individual cabin.”  
I could see this crew member wasn’t the talking type, so I stopped asking questions. We follow him down the hall, up the stairs into what seems to be the most beautiful love I’ve ever seen.   
The stairs seems to be made out of pure crystal and even the lights seem to be made out of crystal. He leads us over to a desk that says “Guest Services” where they immediately hand us each a blue card with our names and photographs on it.   
Mom. “How did you get our photographs?”  
Guest service associate. “We got them after you entered the contest.”  
Claude. “So you were spying on us?”  
Zoe. “Relax, they probably just did a social media survey on each of us.”  
Chloe. “I bet.” I can hear the disbelief in her voice.   
I look around the lobby and I see a whole bunch of people at different tables chattering away and enjoying different drinks, then I notice a table with 2 really beautiful woman sitting, they look to be about my age, but one has long blonde hair and blue eyes and she is wearing a long white dress, and the other one has long red hair and green eyes, and she seems to be wearing a similar dress to the other one, just hers is red. Then another table caught my eye, at it there is a slender beautiful lady sitting, she had long black hair, and is wearing a body hugging black evening dress, she has these sharp blue eyes, almost cat like, and talking about cats, she has a black cat laying in her shoulders just staring back at me, I couldn’t help but notice that she was sipping from a glass of red wine, then she looks back at me and lifts her glass and gives me a nod. “

17spxrc,1,2023-11-11,Cruise to nowhere - part 1,u/the_unknown_ghost,stayawake,https://www.reddit.com/r/stayawake/comments/17spxrc/cruise_to_nowhere_part_1/,"Have you ever had that feeling that something is just to good to be true? Well someone once told me that when something is too good to be true, then it usually is to good to be true.   
Well my mother always had this habit of entering every online contest she could find, whether it is a questionnaire or even a survey, the moment she sees  the words “contest” or “win” she couldn’t help herself. But she also has this “fire and forget system” where she will enter and completely forget about it. It usually ends up been a dud, but she does have luck in that way where she would win little prizes at times, I think the biggest prizes she has won so far would be a months worth of groceries, which is always welcome as we are a struggling family. My father died just after my younger brothers birth and he was a struggling musician, so he didn’t have any life policies or even a funeral plan in place, my mother worked as a waitress at the time, so everything just accumulated to more debt for her, she ended up working double shifts 7 days a week and the few hours she was at home she would drink until she passed out. As I was the eldest the responsibilities of taking care of our home and my younger brother fell upon me, luckily I have always been an A student at school and I just got a scholarship to go to varsity to study for a medical doctor.   
Another thing that always counted in my favour is that I always had great looks, so I always ended up getting photographic modelling work which helped us as the money was pretty decent and I could at-least afford to buy some basic necessities for our home and myself, and since half of my mothers money went into alcohol and cigarettes it made things really tight at home, but it could have been worse, considering that she was there when my father was mutilated and murdered for a packet of smokes. She saw everything, the robbers didn’t just rob him, they tortured him and by the time the police arrived he was unrecognisable.   
My brother is 16 now and he is very sporty, he excels at every sport he tries and he keeps winning prizes, which makes me proud of him, but it also made him a bit over confident and arrogant, I myself am a 19 year old girl and I will be starting my first semester at the best medical school in my country next year.   
Let me tell you about the town where I live, I live in a small town just about 30km from the nearest city, and as we can’t afford boarding school my brother and myself always had to get up early in the morning and make it to the main road and hope someone would give us a ride to school, the mornings were the easy part of the day, it is in the afternoons that we really struggled and we have learned to just walk up the mountain after school as we got a better chance of getting home, some days we would get lucky and someone would pick us up, but other days it would take us hours to walk home.   
That’s a bit about my life.   
Now let me tell you what happened to us, so I finished school last year, but because I didn’t want my brother to go down alone I would still go down to the city with him daily, and I used this year to try and make extra money doing part time work in the city while my brother was at school. So on the last day of school for the year I met him at our usual spot and we decided to start making our way up the mountain when this really expensive car stopped next to us, I don’t really know much about cars as I’m more into my modelling and medical stuff, but if you see a long black sedan with tinted windows and shiny mags pull up you know that you are either in trouble, or you got very lucky.   
So the car pulled up next to us and this tall blonde well dressed, well groomed middle age man got out and looked at us. Aren’t you Zoe and Jean Clarke?   
Zoe. “Depends who is asking and why.”  
Man. “Relax, I’m here to deliver a prize to your family, would you guys like a ride home?”  
Zoe. “Um, a prize?”   
Man. “Yes. “ smiling. “Your family won the family of the year contest.”  
Zoe. “Oh okay, what is the prize?”  
Man. “I’m sorry, but I can only disclose that to Mrs Clarke.”  
Zoe. “You mean Miss.”  
Man. “Oh I apologise, I didn’t realise she got divorced. “  
Zoe. “Widowed.”  
Man. “I apologise and I’m sorry for your loss, now would you please get in? I’m on a rather tight schedule.”  
My brother and I look at each other and he just shrugs and gets in the back, I take a seat at the front and fasten my seatbelt. Honestly I am pretty thankful for this ride as it is very hot today, not that it’s ever not warm in South Africa.   
So the man gets in and he offers us each a bottle of cold water which we gladly accept as we are both dying of thirst and then without another word he starts the car and off we went, you know when you walk the same road every day you actually stop noticing the scenery and you just focus on where you are walking, that is how my brother and I have become, we stopped even noticing anything any-more, but today it was like as if for the first time ever we could enjoy the scenery again and the beauty of nature, but as I got lost in though the car came to a standstill and the man turned off the ignition. I look up to see that we arrived at my mothers work place.   
Man. “You two wait here, I will go fetch your mother and then we can all go talk at your house.”  
We both sit in the car stunned, how did he even know where mom works? Oh well, with all these contest and surveys she’s always filling out you never know.   
We watch on as he walks over to the owner and speaks to the owner, we can see the owner arguing with him and shaking his ear, but then this strange man pulls something out of his pocket and hands it to the owner, the owner just goes pale and he becomes docile at once and goes inside, after a few minutes he comes out with our mother and we can see him handing her a thick envelope and shaking her hand, she just smiles and gives him a tight hug. Then her and the man comes over and they both get into the car.   
Zoe. “Hi mom.”  
Mom. “Hi kids.”  
Jean. In his usual arrogant tone. “Hi mom.”  
Zoe. “Mom, what just happened?”  
Mom. “Oh nothing, James just gave me a years worth of wages and said to have fun and he will see us when we get back.”  
Now I am very confused. “A years wages? See us when we get back.”  
Man. “Don’t worry about it, I will explain everything at your house.”  
Just then we pulled into the driveway and we all went inside.   
The man grabs a cooler box out of the drunk and he joins us on the veranda, he then first takes out a bottle of wine and then 4 glasses, but then he stops and looks in the direction of the gate and back at me. “Zoe, I think you might want to get that.”  
Just then I heard a voice calling my name at the gate. “Zoe!!! Zoe!!!! “   
I get up and grab the gate keys to let Chloe in, now Chloe is my best friend, but Chloe is not her real name, she picked the name Chloe because she said it rhymes with Zoe, she use to be a boy, but she is a transgender girl now, and honestly if she had to enter modelling I would quit, she actually got a scholarship to go and study psychiatry.   
So as Chloe and I get back inside the man is sitting on the one chair by the table with a huge grin on his face. He poured 5 glasses of dry red wine and everyone seems to be waiting in anticipation.   
Man, “well, now that we are all here I guess I can tell you what your big prize is.”  
Jean. “Let me guess, a years worth of groceries.” Still in his arrogant sarcastic tone.”  
Mom. “Stop it, don’t be rude.”  
Man. “No, well that as well. But you guys, the 4 of you won an epic cruise to everywhere and nowhere. “  
Chloe. “Wait, that doesn’t make any sense at all, everywhere and nowhere?”  
Now have you ever had that feeling that something is wrong? Terribly wrong? Like first of all it’s too good to be true, and yet nothing makes sense?” Well that’s the feeling I have right now, and looking back, I wish I went with my instincts.

As I look around in confusion I feel a cold chill run down my back, nobody is this fast, I was just a few seconds behind him.  
I get back to find the group already in the second bottle of wine, it seems this strange man left is 6 bottles, so I join in, more out of nervousness, but soon the wine hits me and I fell asleep on the couch. But just as I start to fall into a deep sleep my mom shakes me awake.   
Mom. “Zoe, we got to get ready, the driver will be here shortly.”  
Zoe. “Mom, are you sure you want to go?”  
Mom, “Of-course we are going. It’s a free holiday.”  
Zoe. “But mom, doesn’t something feel off about this whole thing?”  
Mom, “of course, but I spoke to the neighbour and she said she will check on the house for us.”  
Zoe. “Not that, this holiday.”  
Mom. “Yeah, a fee all inclusive holiday? It’s about time we won a big prize like this.”  
Zoe. “But mom, can you remember…”  
Just then I get interrupted by a car hooting st the gate.   
Before I could say anything else an excited Chloe grabs my hand and yanks me to my feet, “let’s go sleepy head.”  
My mom locks up and we all get to the car waiting for us. It’s another black car similar to the first one, but this time it is a pale blonde woman driving it. She speaks to us in an almost hypnotic voice, “welcome, please get in, we have a long way to go.”  
Claude. “No shit. Not sure how we are going to make an 8 hour drive in 3:33.”  
Woman. “I am the best driver there is.”  
Claude. “Okay transporter. “  
My mom, Claude and Chloe shuffled into the back and I decide to hop in the front seat again.   
But soon after I got in a fell asleep again just to be awoken by this strange woman. “We have arrived.”  
I look around to the back to find the others also fell asleep, they are all yawning now and stretching.   
We shuffle out of the car to find an empty peer with a huge cruise ship waiting for us.   
Zoe. “This is strange, where is everyone else?”  
Woman. “Already on-board, we are a minute late. So off you go.”  
We make our way hesitantly into the ship to be greeted by an annoyed looking crew member, “you are a minute late.”  
Zoe. “Sorry, we were not the ones driving.”  
I then look around to find the door we entered through was already closed behind us.   
Crew. “Follow me please, I will show you to your cabins.”  
Chloe. “Cabins? That means we get more then one?”  
Crew. “You were each assigned your own individual cabin.”  
I could see this crew member wasn’t the talking type, so I stopped asking questions. We follow him down the hall, up the stairs into what seems to be the most beautiful love I’ve ever seen.   
The stairs seems to be made out of pure crystal and even the lights seem to be made out of crystal. He leads us over to a desk that says “Guest Services” where they immediately hand us each a blue card with our names and photographs on it.   
Mom. “How did you get our photographs?”  
Guest service associate. “We got them after you entered the contest.”  
Claude. “So you were spying on us?”  
Zoe. “Relax, they probably just did a social media survey on each of us.”  
Chloe. “I bet.” I can hear the disbelief in her voice.   
I look around the lobby and I see a whole bunch of people at different tables chattering away and enjoying different drinks, then I notice a table with 2 really beautiful woman sitting, they look to be about my age, but one has long blonde hair and blue eyes and she is wearing a long white dress, and the other one has long red hair and green eyes, and she seems to be wearing a similar dress to the other one, just hers is red. Then another table caught my eye, at it there is a slender beautiful lady sitting, she had long black hair, and is wearing a body hugging black evening dress, she has these sharp blue eyes, almost cat like, and talking about cats, she has a black cat laying in her shoulders just staring back at me, I couldn’t help but notice that she was sipping from a glass of red wine, then she looks back at me and lifts her glass and gives me a nod. “

17spye5,2,2023-11-11,Cruise to nowhere - part 1,u/the_unknown_ghost,TheCrypticCompendium,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/17spye5/cruise_to_nowhere_part_1/,"Have you ever had that feeling that something is just to good to be true? Well someone once told me that when something is too good to be true, then it usually is to good to be true.   
Well my mother always had this habit of entering every online contest she could find, whether it is a questionnaire or even a survey, the moment she sees  the words “contest” or “win” she couldn’t help herself. But she also has this “fire and forget system” where she will enter and completely forget about it. It usually ends up been a dud, but she does have luck in that way where she would win little prizes at times, I think the biggest prizes she has won so far would be a months worth of groceries, which is always welcome as we are a struggling family. My father died just after my younger brothers birth and he was a struggling musician, so he didn’t have any life policies or even a funeral plan in place, my mother worked as a waitress at the time, so everything just accumulated to more debt for her, she ended up working double shifts 7 days a week and the few hours she was at home she would drink until she passed out. As I was the eldest the responsibilities of taking care of our home and my younger brother fell upon me, luckily I have always been an A student at school and I just got a scholarship to go to varsity to study for a medical doctor.   
Another thing that always counted in my favour is that I always had great looks, so I always ended up getting photographic modelling work which helped us as the money was pretty decent and I could at-least afford to buy some basic necessities for our home and myself, and since half of my mothers money went into alcohol and cigarettes it made things really tight at home, but it could have been worse, considering that she was there when my father was mutilated and murdered for a packet of smokes. She saw everything, the robbers didn’t just rob him, they tortured him and by the time the police arrived he was unrecognisable.   
My brother is 16 now and he is very sporty, he excels at every sport he tries and he keeps winning prizes, which makes me proud of him, but it also made him a bit over confident and arrogant, I myself am a 19 year old girl and I will be starting my first semester at the best medical school in my country next year.   
Let me tell you about the town where I live, I live in a small town just about 30km from the nearest city, and as we can’t afford boarding school my brother and myself always had to get up early in the morning and make it to the main road and hope someone would give us a ride to school, the mornings were the easy part of the day, it is in the afternoons that we really struggled and we have learned to just walk up the mountain after school as we got a better chance of getting home, some days we would get lucky and someone would pick us up, but other days it would take us hours to walk home.   
That’s a bit about my life.   
Now let me tell you what happened to us, so I finished school last year, but because I didn’t want my brother to go down alone I would still go down to the city with him daily, and I used this year to try and make extra money doing part time work in the city while my brother was at school. So on the last day of school for the year I met him at our usual spot and we decided to start making our way up the mountain when this really expensive car stopped next to us, I don’t really know much about cars as I’m more into my modelling and medical stuff, but if you see a long black sedan with tinted windows and shiny mags pull up you know that you are either in trouble, or you got very lucky.   
So the car pulled up next to us and this tall blonde well dressed, well groomed middle age man got out and looked at us. Aren’t you Zoe and Jean Clarke?   
Zoe. “Depends who is asking and why.”  
Man. “Relax, I’m here to deliver a prize to your family, would you guys like a ride home?”  
Zoe. “Um, a prize?”   
Man. “Yes. “ smiling. “Your family won the family of the year contest.”  
Zoe. “Oh okay, what is the prize?”  
Man. “I’m sorry, but I can only disclose that to Mrs Clarke.”  
Zoe. “You mean Miss.”  
Man. “Oh I apologise, I didn’t realise she got divorced. “  
Zoe. “Widowed.”  
Man. “I apologise and I’m sorry for your loss, now would you please get in? I’m on a rather tight schedule.”  
My brother and I look at each other and he just shrugs and gets in the back, I take a seat at the front and fasten my seatbelt. Honestly I am pretty thankful for this ride as it is very hot today, not that it’s ever not warm in South Africa.   
So the man gets in and he offers us each a bottle of cold water which we gladly accept as we are both dying of thirst and then without another word he starts the car and off we went, you know when you walk the same road every day you actually stop noticing the scenery and you just focus on where you are walking, that is how my brother and I have become, we stopped even noticing anything any-more, but today it was like as if for the first time ever we could enjoy the scenery again and the beauty of nature, but as I got lost in though the car came to a standstill and the man turned off the ignition. I look up to see that we arrived at my mothers work place.   
Man. “You two wait here, I will go fetch your mother and then we can all go talk at your house.”  
We both sit in the car stunned, how did he even know where mom works? Oh well, with all these contest and surveys she’s always filling out you never know.   
We watch on as he walks over to the owner and speaks to the owner, we can see the owner arguing with him and shaking his ear, but then this strange man pulls something out of his pocket and hands it to the owner, the owner just goes pale and he becomes docile at once and goes inside, after a few minutes he comes out with our mother and we can see him handing her a thick envelope and shaking her hand, she just smiles and gives him a tight hug. Then her and the man comes over and they both get into the car.   
Zoe. “Hi mom.”  
Mom. “Hi kids.”  
Jean. In his usual arrogant tone. “Hi mom.”  
Zoe. “Mom, what just happened?”  
Mom. “Oh nothing, James just gave me a years worth of wages and said to have fun and he will see us when we get back.”  
Now I am very confused. “A years wages? See us when we get back.”  
Man. “Don’t worry about it, I will explain everything at your house.”  
Just then we pulled into the driveway and we all went inside.   
The man grabs a cooler box out of the drunk and he joins us on the veranda, he then first takes out a bottle of wine and then 4 glasses, but then he stops and looks in the direction of the gate and back at me. “Zoe, I think you might want to get that.”  
Just then I heard a voice calling my name at the gate. “Zoe!!! Zoe!!!! “   
I get up and grab the gate keys to let Chloe in, now Chloe is my best friend, but Chloe is not her real name, she picked the name Chloe because she said it rhymes with Zoe, she use to be a boy, but she is a transgender girl now, and honestly if she had to enter modelling I would quit, she actually got a scholarship to go and study psychiatry.   
So as Chloe and I get back inside the man is sitting on the one chair by the table with a huge grin on his face. He poured 5 glasses of dry red wine and everyone seems to be waiting in anticipation.   
Man, “well, now that we are all here I guess I can tell you what your big prize is.”  
Jean. “Let me guess, a years worth of groceries.” Still in his arrogant sarcastic tone.”  
Mom. “Stop it, don’t be rude.”  
Man. “No, well that as well. But you guys, the 4 of you won an epic cruise to everywhere and nowhere. “  
Chloe. “Wait, that doesn’t make any sense at all, everywhere and nowhere?”  
Now have you ever had that feeling that something is wrong? Terribly wrong? Like first of all it’s too good to be true, and yet nothing makes sense?” Well that’s the feeling I have right now, and looking back, I wish I went with my instincts.  
Man. “Yes, you will go everywhere and stay nowhere. Congratulations.”  
So we all take our wine glasses and cheers and take a sip. “ I’m still feeling uneasy about the whole thing. But I decided to keep quiet for my moms sake, she’s been working for years without even so much as 1 day break. And I could see that she was really excited for this.   
Mom. “So how long is this cruise for?”  
Man. “Oh just a couple of months or so. Don’t worry, you will have the time of your LIFE.” The way he said LIFE, with an almost creepy voice gave me the chills.  
But hey, it’s a cruise, the worst that can happen is the ship can sink, right?”  
Man. “And don’t worry about bringing anything, everything will be provided for you on the cruise, it’s an all inclusive cruise, even your clothing will be provided. We already got your sizes and everything, so your cabin will be fully stocked, and the best part is all food and drinks are included in your package. “ then he looks at my brother. “And since it’s in international waters, there is no age limit stopping you from enjoying yourself.”  
Mom. “I don’t think I want him to start drinking yet.”  
Claude looking at my mom, you can see he is furious now. “Sure mom, you already drink enough for us all.”  
Zoe. “Stop it now!”   
Mom. “It’s okay, he is right.” I can see she is almost in tears.   
Man. “Anyway, you guys can celebrate tonight, but be ready by 0:00 (midnight) that is when your driver will collect you. “   
Chloe. “Midnight?”  
Man. “Yes, your cruise leaves at 3:33am.”  
Zoe. “You do realise that we would never make it in time.”  
Man. “Relax, our driver has never missed.”  
Jean. “Frowning now. “Never missed.”  
Man. Looking at his wrist. “Oh my, look at the time, I got to be on my way.” And he gets up and walks out. I get up to follow him, but when I get to the gate both him and his car are gone.

We make our way hesitantly into the ship to be greeted by an annoyed looking crew member, “you are a minute late.”  
Zoe. “Sorry, we were not the ones driving.”  
I then look around to find the door we entered through was already closed behind us.   
Crew. “Follow me please, I will show you to your cabins.”  
Chloe. “Cabins? That means we get more then one?”  
Crew. “You were each assigned your own individual cabin.”  


I could see this crew member wasn’t the talking type, so I stopped asking questions. We follow him down the hall, up the stairs into what seems to be the most beautiful love I’ve ever seen.   


The stairs seems to be made out of pure crystal and even the lights seem to be made out of crystal. He leads us over to a desk that says “Guest Services” where they immediately hand us each a blue card with our names and photographs on it.   
Mom. “How did you get our photographs?”  
Guest service associate. “We got them after you entered the contest.”  
Claude. “So you were spying on us?”  
Zoe. “Relax, they probably just did a social media survey on each of us.”  
Chloe. “I bet.” I can hear the disbelief in her voice.   


I look around the lobby and I see a whole bunch of people at different tables chattering away and enjoying different drinks, then I notice a table with 2 really beautiful woman sitting, they look to be about my age, but one has long blonde hair and blue eyes and she is wearing a long white dress, and the other one has long red hair and green eyes, and she seems to be wearing a similar dress to the other one, just hers is red. Then another table caught my eye, at it there is a slender beautiful lady sitting, she had long black hair, and is wearing a body hugging black evening dress, she has these sharp blue eyes, almost cat like, and talking about cats, she has a black cat laying in her shoulders just staring back at me, I couldn’t help but notice that she was sipping from a glass of red wine, then she looks back at me and lifts her glass and gives me a nod. “

Well someone once told me that when something is too good to be true, then it usually is to good to be true.   


Well my mother always had this habit of entering every online contest she could find, whether it is a questionnaire or even a survey, the moment she sees  the words “contest” or “win” she couldn’t help herself. But she also has this “fire and forget system” where she will enter and completely forget about it. It usually ends up been a dud, but she does have luck in that way where she would win little prizes at times, I think the biggest prizes she has won so far would be a months worth of groceries, which is always welcome as we are a struggling family. My father died just after my younger brothers birth and he was a struggling musician, so he didn’t have any life policies or even a funeral plan in place, my mother worked as a waitress at the time, so everything just accumulated to more debt for her, she ended up working double shifts 7 days a week and the few hours she was at home she would drink until she passed out. As I was the eldest the responsibilities of taking care of our home and my younger brother fell upon me, luckily I have always been an A student at school and I just got a scholarship to go to varsity to study for a medical doctor.   


Another thing that always counted in my favour is that I always had great looks, so I always ended up getting photographic modelling work which helped us as the money was pretty decent and I could at-least afford to buy some basic necessities for our home and myself, and since half of my mothers money went into alcohol and cigarettes it made things really tight at home, but it could have been worse, considering that she was there when my father was mutilated and murdered for a packet of smokes. She saw everything, the robbers didn’t just rob him, they tortured him and by the time the police arrived he was unrecognisable.   


My brother is 16 now and he is very sporty, he excels at every sport he tries and he keeps winning prizes, which makes me proud of him, but it also made him a bit over confident and arrogant, I myself am a 19 year old girl and I will be starting my first semester at the best medical school in my country next year.   


Let me tell you about the town where I live, I live in a small town just about 30km from the nearest city, and as we can’t afford boarding school my brother and myself always had to get up early in the morning and make it to the main road and hope someone would give us a ride to school, the mornings were the easy part of the day, it is in the afternoons that we really struggled and we have learned to just walk up the mountain after school as we got a better chance of getting home, some days we would get lucky and someone would pick us up, but other days it would take us hours to walk home.   


That’s a bit about my life.   


Now let me tell you what happened to us, so I finished school last year, but because I didn’t want my brother to go down alone I would still go down to the city with him daily, and I used this year to try and make extra money doing part time work in the city while my brother was at school. So on the last day of school for the year I met him at our usual spot and we decided to start making our way up the mountain when this really expensive car stopped next to us, I don’t really know much about cars as I’m more into my modelling and medical stuff, but if you see a long black sedan with tinted windows and shiny mags pull up you know that you are either in trouble, or you got very lucky.   


So the car pulled up next to us and this tall blonde well dressed, well groomed middle age man got out and looked at us. Aren’t you Zoe and Jean Clarke?   
Zoe. “Depends who is asking and why.”  
Man. “Relax, I’m here to deliver a prize to your family, would you guys like a ride home?”  
Zoe. “Um, a prize?”   
Man. “Yes. “ smiling. “Your family won the family of the year contest.”  
Zoe. “Oh okay, what is the prize?”  
Man. “I’m sorry, but I can only disclose that to Mrs Clarke.”  
Zoe. “You mean Miss.”  
Man. “Oh I apologise, I didn’t realise she got divorced. “  
Zoe. “Widowed.”  
Man. “I apologise and I’m sorry for your loss, now would you please get in? I’m on a rather tight schedule.”  
My brother and I look at each other and he just shrugs and gets in the back, I take a seat at the front and fasten my seatbelt. Honestly I am pretty thankful for this ride as it is very hot today, not that it’s ever not warm in South Africa.   


So the man gets in and he offers us each a bottle of cold water which we gladly accept as we are both dying of thirst and then without another word he starts the car and off we went, you know when you walk the same road every day you actually stop noticing the scenery and you just focus on where you are walking, that is how my brother and I have become, we stopped even noticing anything any-more, but today it was like as if for the first time ever we could enjoy the scenery again and the beauty of nature, but as I got lost in though the car came to a standstill and the man turned off the ignition. I look up to see that we arrived at my mothers work place.   


Man. “You two wait here, I will go fetch your mother and then we can all go talk at your house.”  
We both sit in the car stunned, how did he even know where mom works? Oh well, with all these contest and surveys she’s always filling out you never know.   


We watch on as he walks over to the owner and speaks to the owner, we can see the owner arguing with him and shaking his ear, but then this strange man pulls something out of his pocket and hands it to the owner, the owner just goes pale and he becomes docile at once and goes inside, after a few minutes he comes out with our mother and we can see him handing her a thick envelope and shaking her hand, she just smiles and gives him a tight hug. Then her and the man comes over and they both get into the car.   


Zoe. “Hi mom.”  
Mom. “Hi kids.”  
Jean. In his usual arrogant tone. “Hi mom.”  
Zoe. “Mom, what just happened?”  
Mom. “Oh nothing, James just gave me a years worth of wages and said to have fun and he will see us when we get back.”  
Now I am very confused. “A years wages? See us when we get back.”  
Man. “Don’t worry about it, I will explain everything at your house.”  
Just then we pulled into the driveway and we all went inside.   


The man grabs a cooler box out of the drunk and he joins us on the veranda, he then first takes out a bottle of wine and then 4 glasses, but then he stops and looks in the direction of the gate and back at me. “Zoe, I think you might want to get that.”  
Just then I heard a voice calling my name at the gate. “Zoe!!! Zoe!!!! “   
I get up and grab the gate keys to let Chloe in, now Chloe is my best friend, but Chloe is not her real name, she picked the name Chloe because she said it rhymes with Zoe, she use to be a boy, but she is a transgender girl now, and honestly if she had to enter modelling I would quit, she actually got a scholarship to go and study psychiatry.   


So as Chloe and I get back inside the man is sitting on the one chair by the table with a huge grin on his face. He poured 5 glasses of dry red wine and everyone seems to be waiting in anticipation.   
Man, “well, now that we are all here I guess I can tell you what your big prize is.”  
Jean. “Let me guess, a years worth of groceries.” Still in his arrogant sarcastic tone.”  
Mom. “Stop it, don’t be rude.”  
Man. “No, well that as well. But you guys, the 4 of you won an epic cruise to everywhere and nowhere. “  
Chloe. “Wait, that doesn’t make any sense at all, everywhere and nowhere?”  


Now have you ever had that feeling that something is wrong? Terribly wrong? Like first of all it’s too good to be true, and yet nothing makes sense?” Well that’s the feeling I have right now, and looking back, I wish I went with my instincts.  


Man. “Yes, you will go everywhere and stay nowhere. Congratulations.”  
So we all take our wine glasses and cheers and take a sip. “ I’m still feeling uneasy about the whole thing. But I decided to keep quiet for my moms sake, she’s been working for years without even so much as 1 day break. And I could see that she was really excited for this.   
Mom. “So how long is this cruise for?”  
Man. “Oh just a couple of months or so. Don’t worry, you will have the time of your LIFE.” The way he said LIFE, with an almost creepy voice gave me the chills.  
But hey, it’s a cruise, the worst that can happen is the ship can sink, right?”  
Man. “And don’t worry about bringing anything, everything will be provided for you on the cruise, it’s an all inclusive cruise, even your clothing will be provided. We already got your sizes and everything, so your cabin will be fully stocked, and the best part is all food and drinks are included in your package. “ then he looks at my brother. “And since it’s in international waters, there is no age limit stopping you from enjoying yourself.”  
Mom. “I don’t think I want him to start drinking yet.”  
Claude looking at my mom, you can see he is furious now. “Sure mom, you already drink enough for us all.”  
Zoe. “Stop it now!”   
Mom. “It’s okay, he is right.” I can see she is almost in tears.   
Man. “Anyway, you guys can celebrate tonight, but be ready by 0:00 (midnight) that is when your driver will collect you. “   
Chloe. “Midnight?”  
Man. “Yes, your cruise leaves at 3:33am.”  
Zoe. “You do realise that we would never make it in time.”  
Man. “Relax, our driver has never missed.”  
Jean. “Frowning now. “Never missed.”  
Man. Looking at his wrist. “Oh my, look at the time, I got to be on my way.” And he gets up and walks out. I get up to follow him, but when I get to the gate both him and his car are gone. As I look around in confusion I feel a cold chill run down my back, nobody is this fast, I was just a few seconds behind him.  


I get back to find the group already in the second bottle of wine, it seems this strange man left is 6 bottles, so I join in, more out of nervousness, but soon the wine hits me and I fell asleep on the couch. But just as I start to fall into a deep sleep my mom shakes me awake.   
Mom. “Zoe, we got to get ready, the driver will be here shortly.”  
Zoe. “Mom, are you sure you want to go?”  
Mom, “Of-course we are going. It’s a free holiday.”  
Zoe. “But mom, doesn’t something feel off about this whole thing?”  
Mom, “of course, but I spoke to the neighbour and she said she will check on the house for us.”  
Zoe. “Not that, this holiday.”  
Mom. “Yeah, a fee all inclusive holiday? It’s about time we won a big prize like this.”  
Zoe. “But mom, can you remember…”  
Just then I get interrupted by a car hooting st the gate.   
Before I could say anything else an excited Chloe grabs my hand and yanks me to my feet, “let’s go sleepy head.”  
My mom locks up and we all get to the car waiting for us. It’s another black car similar to the first one, but this time it is a pale blonde woman driving it. She speaks to us in an almost hypnotic voice, “welcome, please get in, we have a long way to go.”  
Claude. “No shit. Not sure how we are going to make an 8 hour drive in 3:33.”  
Woman. “I am the best driver there is.”  
Claude. “Okay transporter. “  
My mom, Claude and Chloe shuffled into the back and I decide to hop in the front seat again.   


But soon after I got in a fell asleep again just to be awoken by this strange woman. “We have arrived.”  
I look around to the back to find the others also fell asleep, they are all yawning now and stretching.   


We shuffle out of the car to find an empty peer with a huge cruise ship waiting for us.   
Zoe. “This is strange, where is everyone else?”  
Woman. “Already on-board, we are a minute late. So off you go.”  
We make our way hesitantly into the ship to be greeted by an annoyed looking crew member, “you are a minute late.”

17ssze5,30,2023-11-11,Pahari Architecture through the ages,u/EastOwl1882,Uttarakhand,https://www.reddit.com/r/Uttarakhand/comments/17ssze5/pahari_architecture_through_the_ages/,"When we now look around Uttarakhand emerging cities, such as Dehradun and Haridwar. We observe sprawls of ugly unaesthetic homes here and there. Pahari are now busy in buildings these homes in an attempt to modernize themselves. the ancient art of woods craftsmanship is already facing crisis. 

now this disease is reaching villages too! 

*""****Before you just scream over about budget issue, this post is only intended to provide a glimpse of our architecture throughout the ages, you can just read the post and try to incorporate some elements of our heritage into your daily life and creating buildings in the future.""***

*""In order to study the architecture of any society or civilization, we have to look at what the biggest buildings are dedicated too. ""*\- French anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss 

for Uttarakhand, they are mostly temples and palaces.

**Khasa**   
we observe that there are very few big temples in Uttarakhand which are ancient.   
In a sense, in the plains we observe most temples lie in the major cities which served as trading towns. e.g. Kashi, Ayodhya, Tamluk , Somnath, Dwarka   
Uttarakhand in contrast had numerous small temples sprawling here and there. Infact, Kedarnath is also very comparatively smaller than most of the other temples of India.

the wooden design of these temples is a strict blessing from khasas

this wooden architecture still exists in the region of Jaunsar and Himachal. This wooden architecture is a remnant of the traditional Khasa architecture.

**Enter the Stone era.**   
Over time as economy developed and khasas established their early empires like Katyuri and Khasa - Mallas. they began to construct stone temples.

[jageshwar dham](https://preview.redd.it/1s2uxmnn2pzb1.png?width=660&format=png&auto=webp&s=ddd23a2a5275591c46eb8d6a8c7cb0d0d8effe48)

In the **late Medieval era,** palaces too began to be constructed as well.

[Malla mahal used to serve as a fort of Chanda kings ](https://preview.redd.it/1vdabbs5dpzb1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=c49e897720f4396739e6c38944c3d26f8746b7a2)

Uttarakhand architecture also influenced the architecture of Rohila. they specifically incorporated Kumaoni architecture

**Enters the British**   
Britishers kind of prioritized Victorian and gothic architectural styles.

**Modern Pahari homes**   
In the modern history, analyzing Pahari homes. We now get to see this ugly looking unaesthetic architecture plain simple homes marketed as ""modern""

[Don't want to use real picture, but you get the point. ](https://preview.redd.it/uoaoddra2pzb1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=abbe55d260679e4472e07e3e607fde6056c4661b)

Elements of architecture 

1. **Detailing**. any uniqueness, skilled craftsmanship. irony is that we now see this appreciation by so called rich outsider in their homes. 
2. **Architectural style** used in the home. 

[Newari style ](https://preview.redd.it/nvog9y1g4pzb1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9527d3b6f7619b283383eb7fbd2edc19715ba09)

1. **materials and texture. I**ncorporate wood in the design. government should provide relaxation in this area. Local materials should be prioritized.
2. **Colors**. Honestly, I don't have expertise in this area. but I think using **earthy tones to mimic nature, creates harmony.** 
3. **Harmony**. with other homes, with street, Greek use of ratios 

[homes which are of same height, but different designs and colors, in order to create organized complexity.](https://preview.redd.it/dn24hlov9pzb1.png?width=612&format=png&auto=webp&s=826a87f3b2d7d1cbada9b558ed71b4269dab53a2)

1. **Symmetry.** symmetrical homes are loved all over the world, though if you still want asymmetrical home you need to create a kind of organized look.

1. **Detailing**. any uniqueness, skilled craftsmanship. irony is that we now see this appreciation by so called rich outsider in their homes. especially, in doors and windows.

now what are the takeaways, 

the first thing is to revive the lost architectural styles and continuously innovate it. 

[gharaan style of architecture](https://preview.redd.it/r5ex0qqj9pzb1.png?width=674&format=png&auto=webp&s=0dd11d33e497a045a92e5e3b3c8a96cf24a3549b)

* a detailed study of the ancient architecture to very minute details 
* investing in ""cultural enhancement programs"", motivating experts to pursue 
* learn from other countries. 
* Germany

* Caucasian region

* Nearby regions like Nepal, HP, Kashmir, Tibet, Hindukush. 
* start prioritizing aesthetics first in the public buildings. Locals will then start taking inspiration look at this shit, governor house, CM house, 
* change the syllabus of architecture and teach new students about aesthetics, historic architecture, traditional architectural designs. Nagara, Kath Kuni, Newar, Kashmiri, Kumauni, Garhwali.   
*  locals should start hiring architects and interior designers instead of relentlessly relying on contractors. OK!! I get it, but we should at least minutely learn basics of architecture and interior design. 
* We can at least incorporate traditional doors, Sloped roofs, Window design.
*  Pay attention to architectural details and ornamentation. Intricate details, decorative elements, and craftsmanship can significantly enhance the aesthetic appeal of a home. 

Pahari architectural revival is not only limited to your homes, but also to the temples to the schools and to the government buildings.

I am a highschool teacher. I can't sing enough high praise about AI and it's benefits for lesson planning and teaching I'm general. 

I am however encountering an issue which is bothering myself and my students. 

I deliver my lesson content on OneNote, however, when I copy text from ChatGPT and paste it into OneNote, some students have green highlights all throughout their OneNote page. 

I have done the ""Keep text only"" in Word/OneNote, and whilst it doesn't have any highlights behind the text from my end, it does show up on their computer. 

Ultimately, I'm wondering if there is a way to remove the seemingly embedded highlighted format text from ChatGPT so that I can paste it into any app, without any highlights.

Thanks"

Since I'm now in the process of searching for a new job, I thought it was a good time to post an update and provide some insight into the hiring process for big tech.

&#x200B;

**Section One: Assets and Debt**

|**Asset**|**Amount**|**Notes**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Checking account|$2,273|I don't really use this account too much anymore. It's just helpful as an in-person bank for withdrawing cash.|
|HYSA (technically the Wealthfront Cash checking account)|$74,276|I pay my bills and rent from this account, but since it's an online bank, I maintain the other checking account for in-person needs. It's 5% APY right now which is great.|
|401k|$92,822|I've maxed this out since I started working in 2021. My employer offers a 50% match for my contributions up to the IRS limit (e.g. I put in $10k, they match $5k)|
|Roth IRA|$24,269|I've maxed this out annually since 2020, using the backdoor method once I passed the income limit.|
|Wealthfront Individual Investment account|$90,167|I haven't made any money on these investments, but it's been a wild year for the economy so I'm not too pressed|
|Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) account|$8,559|My employer offers a 15% discount on company stock. I contribute throughout the year, up to a 20k cap. I always sell immediately once the stocks are purchased at discount.|
|Car|$20k|I bought this in cash for market value from my dad after I graduated.|
|**TOTAL**|**$312,366**||

I do not have combined assets with my SO (I'll call him B) - we live together and split expenses like rent, bills, groceries 50/50. I usually pay for excessive spending like vacations, as B is an untraditional student and still in school, but will begin working soon also as a swe. He receives significant grants and stipends from the government and school for living expenses.

&#x200B;

|**Debt**|**Amount**|
|:-|:-|
|Chase Freedom Unlimited card|$6,670|
|Chase Sapphire Preferred card|$543|
|Southwest Rapid Rewards card 1|$149|
|Southwest Rapid Rewards card 2|$200|
|**TOTAL**|**$6462**|

I always pay off my credit cards' full balance monthly. A lot of our household spending is on my cards so I can collect the points and then B pays me back. No student debt; I am fortunate that my parents paid for my college tuition in full.

&#x200B;

**Section Two: Income**

**Income Progression:**

* My first job: $10/hr at a fast food restaurant in high school.
* 1st paid internship: $25/hr as a software engineer intern
* 2nd paid internship: $45/hr as a software engineer intern
* I worked as a TA for my school for 3 semesters and earned about $4000 per semester.
* 1st full-time job: $200k ($130k salary, 60k stock, 10k bonus).
   * I'm still working at the same company, but I've received pay raises & promotions multiple times in the 3 years I've been there. The compensation values below are annualized. It's not Google but I'll use Google's levels as a reference for the promotions.
   * 1st pay raise 1 year later: $260k ($160k salary. It's difficult to calculate the stock number because at this point I have multiple stacking refreshers, and of course stock value changes, but I believe the annual target was around $100k) (Google L4 equivalent)
   * 2nd pay raise 1 year later: $300k ($190k salary. Same as above with the stock number, this was a smaller bump though in terms of stock so I'll estimate $110k)
   * 3rd pay raise 6 months later: $370k ($220k salary, $150k stock) (Google L5 equivalent)

I know I have been very lucky and privileged to be where I'm at. My parents are very much the typical 1st-gen Asian immigrants who value education above everything. I spent my school breaks at SAT bootcamp, extra tutoring, was screamed at if my test scores were too low, and constantly criticized and compared to other people - until I landed my first job and they could finally compare me to everyone else and see that I was on top. I suppose it all paid off in the end, and of course I am thankful to my parents, but it has resulted in a strained and emotionally distant relationship between us. 

I didn't code before entering college but I did go to a top school for software engineering. I could go more into detail about my new grad job search as well, but the gist of it was it was a good market, I had a return offer from my internship as leverage, and I hustled like crazy out of spite - driven by the feeling that my parents would never be proud of me and I would never be good enough. 

I've also been very fortunate to have good managers who support me and my growth, and good teams to work with. 

**Main Job Monthly Take Home:**

Main Job Monthly Take Home: $1927

A large portion of my compensation is RSU (stocks) like many in tech, and can be highly volatile, so I don't include it here in my monthly take home. It currently vests quarterly.

My last (biweekly) paycheck looked like this:

|**Deduction**|**Amount**|
|:-|:-|
|Gross salary|$9205|
|Taxes|\- $2857|
|Additional tax withholding|\- $2600|
|ESPP contribution|\- $1821|
|**TAKE-HOME**|**$1927**|

Dental and vision insurance premiums are negligible. I'm currently still under my dad's health insurance as I'm under 26, and my mom has significant health issues that mean we hit the out-of-pocket maximum every year. I got roasted for this in my last post but seriously my parents wouldn't even let me pay for my own health insurance - it makes 0 sense.

Why the huge extra withholding? I ran the numbers and it turns out my RSU taxes are vastly under-withheld when I sell them, so I'm trying to catch up now by adding additional paycheck withholding to not face IRS underpayment penalties. Obviously I'm not an accountant so this is probably not the ideal way to do it lol. But I calculated the amount of taxes I'd need to pay to avoid the penalty and I think this additional amount through the end of the year should be enough to cover my bases. I'll try to do better next year and add additional withholding from the very beginning of the year.

&#x200B;

**Section Three: Expenses**

Monthly unless otherwise mentioned

|**Expense**|**Amount**|**Description**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Rent|$1500|this is my amount after I split 50/50 with B|
|Gym membership|$25|yes it's insanely cheap, idk how they're making money|
|Gas & electric|$70|this is my amount after I split 50/50 with B|
|Dog supplies|$250|$40/mo Pet insurance, $80/mo food, $100/mo grooming, misc.|
|Internet|$5|split 50/50 with B, again insanely cheap, they were installing fiber in our neighborhood and we got a great intro deal. Tbh it might have gone up but B is the one handling it|
|Subscriptions|$30|iCloud, chatGPT, YNAB. I'm on  B's Prime and spotify - roast me|
|Renter insurance|$110/yr||
|Car insurance|$1100/yr||
|Gas|$15|I only drive to work which is why this is so low. I hate driving and so B usually drives other places. I've offered to pay him gas money but he's refused|
|Donations|$50|I have a recurring $50 donation to Planned Parenthood. My company also does a 1:1 match. I've also donated sporadically to other causes. Given my income has grown I'm planning to up this amount, but once all the job changing stuff has settled down|
|Investments|Whatever's leftover tbh, I don't have a set target amount||
|Phone|Still on my parent's plan.. I can hear the roasting in the comments already haha||

&#x200B;

**Section Four: Money Diary**

I thought this would be an entertaining week to write about because I'm seriously going through it with the job hunt and my spending has been somewhat unhinged. Despite the tech job market truly being in the gutter recently, I've been looking for a different job. Why? It's my dream to move to New York. Like, truly my dream. I can't think about anything else. This is consuming my every waking thought and all my dreams at night. I have never felt such a draw or desire to do anything in my life. I would do anything to make this happen. But my current company doesn’t support remote work. 

B feels similarly. And now, with B graduating, this is the time to make the move. But, it's difficult because B also needs to get a job there - he currently does have a job lined up which *might* have the possibility of being remote, but we have no idea yet. And of course, the tech industry is not doing well right now and no one is hiring new grads. Every day I'm vacillating wildly between hope and despair. So, unhinged spending. Please be entertained and feel free to roast me for being delusional.

&#x200B;

**Day 0 - Saturday**

* It's an uneventful Saturday for us. Last weekend was really tiring so I'm grateful to rest.
* B and I head to the gym and then he buys a frisbee at the sporting goods store after. We head to Trader Joe's and pick up some groceries for the week (**$111** for my share)
* We go home, pick up Fluffy and throw the frisbee together at the park. It's a nice afternoon.
* I do some studying for my interviews the evening. Watching some videos on system design and doing some coding practice problems.

**Day 0 Total: $111**

&#x200B;

**Day 1 - Sunday**

* I've last-minute decided to go on a little Thanksgiving getaway with B, because otherwise I'm going to lose my mind. I hash out our plans and book ziplining for both of us - **$273**
* Now for interview prep - I've been putting off preparing for this one interview. They want me to set up my own environment and share my screen during the interview, so there's some prep work involved in that. Luckily the setup doesn't take too long. I take some time after that to do some more studying.
* I need to restock on some hair products - **$40.** Usually I go for cheap drugstore stuff but I've decided to treat myself with some Oribe products. It's what my salon uses and it just smells so good.
* I'm hosting friends over for dinner and watching TV. I set up some appetizers and order sushi. The wine is in free-flow. **($156** for sushi, **$40** for wine and other appetizers). I really enjoy being able to treat my friends and appreciate their effort in visiting me. It's truly a lovely start to the week.
* Off to bed... unfortunately, the wine headache is getting to me. Fortunately, I'm not staying up tossing and turning due to pre-interview anxiety, and instead instantly pass out. So that's a plus?

**Day 1 Total: $509**

&#x200B;

**Day 2 - Monday**

* Fortunately I wake up without a hangover. I make coffee and walk my dog, Fluffy, before my morning interviews.
* I have 2 interviews today - 1 round with the hiring manager (HM) and 1 technical interview. They go really well and I'm feeling good about this company, we'll call them CorpA. This is the final 2 interviews. The process was recruiter call > 1 technical interview > onsite with 4 technical interviews & 1 HM behavioral.
* Barely an hour after the interviews complete, I get an email from the recruiter saying the interviews went well and she'll have a formal update for me tomorrow - an offer???!!
* B gets back from school and we hit the gym together during my lunch break. We have leftover sushi for lunch.
* I fire off an email to CorpF following up on a HM interview I had with them a week ago.  It seemed to go well but I had the sense that the HM was looking for someone with more experience. Ghosting isn't cool but CorpF is truly one of my dream companies, so I decide it's worth it to bug them. 
* I had another technical interview scheduled with CorpB for the afternoon. Unfortunately, they had to last-minute reschedule to next week. I'm not too enthusiastic about the company, but I figure I'll just make it through 1 interview and then cancel after if I'm not feeling them.
* I'm still working for my current company, so I get some work done.
* Dinner time - I'm tired and my mental state is all over the place and so is the dinner I make. I throw the most random things I can find into a pot and boil it.  Frozen wontons, kimchi, bone browth, some leftover rotisserie chicken. And a... shrimp burger patty? Idk it was the last one in the freezer. It sounds questionable but B is happy to eat with me.
* I got a check in the mail for $109. It's like one of those unclaimed property things. Apparently I won this money from a class-action lawsuit a while back? Anyways, score!
* Work on some last minute prep for tomorrow's interview - I need to prepare a shark tank style pitch for one of them. I do some research and write up a plan for that.

**Day 2 Total: $0**

&#x200B;

**Day 3 - Tuesday**

* Super early morning today. I haul myself out of bed, dead on my feet, and make coffee. Quickly throw on some makeup and hop on for my first set of interviews - 2 behavioral interviews for CorpC. The process here was: recruiter call > coding challenge (that you complete on your own time) > HM interview > 2 technical interviews > director and hm call. It’s been a really long process with them but the industry is one I’m personally interested in. I give my prepared shark tank pitch to the director and it seems to go well. He also grills me pretty hard on my projects. 
* After the CorpC interviews, I have the first interview of the onsite loop for CorpD, a HM behavioral. The process with CorpD was recruiter call > technical interview > onsite. This interview is 1 of 5, as I have them split over multiple days to fit my schedule. My feeling is that the HM is not very impressed, but he's hard to read. He really dug into asking about the technical details of my projects.
* CorpA emails back with good news - they want to extend an offer! Part of me is over the moon - I can still do it, I haven’t been faking it this whole time at work. But another part of me is sad because I know it’s highly unlikely I will say yes to the offer. I know CorpA used to pay very well, but as part of cost cutting that’s common industry-wide right now, their offers have become significantly weaker. Another factor is that they require in-person work, and B hasn't lined up a NY position yet.
* CorpF gets back to me - they've been OOO. My hunch was correct in that the HM wanted to move forward with other candidates, but the recruiter wants to schedule a tech screening with me anyways and consider me for other roles.
* Anyways it’s time to head to the office for my actual job. It’s a full day of meetings today but I try to squeeze in some coding in between meetings.
* I take the offer call from CorpA at lunch. As expected, it’s lower than my current compensation. Of course it’s a dream compensation for most and I’d be an entitled \*\*\*\*\* tor turning it down… I do really like the company, team, and manager. For some numbers - it’s around $240k all in. $160k salary, 60k stock, 20k bonus. Which is obviously a great compensation for anyone. I thank the recruiter and tell her I’ll be considering the offer.
* A close friend, L, from middle school is in the area for a business trip and we have plans to get dinner together and catch up. B and I pick him up from his office and we go to a popular local ramen joint and catch up. (**$50**) He actually lives in NY but is considering moving once his lease is up. I'm like, you're living my dream here! Don't throw it away like that!
* We get ice cream for dessert before parting ways (**$18**). I really hope L doesn't leave NY before I move there. 
* The second payment for the Airbnb I booked for Thanksgiving goes through - **$536.**  The total was around $950 for 3 nights.

**Day 3 Total: $604**

&#x200B;

**Day 4 - Wednesday**

* Another early morning of interviews with CorpD. The first one was so terrible you guys, I was so tempted to tell the interviewer to just drop me from the process. I solved the problem he asked in the first 10 minutes and the rest of the interview he spent grilling me on micro-optimizations I could make. He didn’t seem pleased with any of my answers and seemed to be fishing for a very specific answer. It was so deeply unpleasant and did not reflect the kind of stuff I do in my actual work. I felt bad cancelling on the second interviewer so I told myself to push through, at least they would be good practice.
* Fortunately the second interview went a lot better. The interviewer was friendly and warm and it went smoothly. I was still tempted to cancel the rest, especially since my feeling is that the offer won’t match my current compensation either, but.. no, let’s just push through. I can do it. 
* 1 more quick chat with an engineer from the team at CorpA. Not an interview, more like me learning more about them. He is super nice and friendly. I feel even worse that I'm probably going to turn them down. 
* Off to work now. I’m so insanely tired. I have to act normal to my coworkers but I’m truly falling apart inside. My dreams aren’t going to come true, I’m going to be stuck here forever, and also, I’m being an asshole and not appreciating what I have. I *could* drop everything and move - dump my boyfriend, take the pay cut, but I can't and so I'm torn. 
* I get through some work powered by green tea. Emails have been coming in all day from CorpA congratulating me and encouraging me to join. I feel guilty.
* Walking through the dark and cold parking garage to my car, I just start sobbing. Seriously pathetic, I know. It was just the feeling that I didn’t want to be here anymore, that I never want to drive again or walk through an empty dead parking garage, driving home alone in the dark. Comparing this to a vibrant commute walking on the streets of Manhattan.
* I get home and crash. Eat some leftover ramen and take a nap. Bought a few pairs of earrings as I've been needing some new ones. **($89)**

**Day 4 Total: $89**

&#x200B;

**Day 5 - Thursday**

* Another morning behavioral interview with CorpD. It goes okay. Im just so tired of talking. I’m not sure why they have 2 very similar behavioral interviews in their loop. At least this HM seems friendlier than the last. The last chat is with the recruiter and I ask if she has any feedback for me yet - only the first HM filled out his feedback but it seemed positive - I was surprised as he really did grill me.
* Fortunately I have some time after the interview for the gym. My mood is definitely uplifted from the workout. 
* B takes Fluffy to his grooming appointment and picks up his pet food - I pay him back (**$140**)
* At the office once more. Get some good focus time in and get some work down. I'm definitely in a much better mood today, thanks to my workout. 
* CorpB emails me back and says they want to do 1 more final behavioral loop with a director. I'm tired. I don't think they can match my compensation either. But at this point I'm in a sunk cost fallacy so I agree.
* I get an email from CorpA's recruiter. I had expressed some dissatisfaction with the offer during the initial call, and she offers a salary bump if I'm open to hearing about it. I guess the team really wants me. We arrange a phone call for the next day. I don't think the bump is enough to make up the difference, but I guess I'll just take the call anyways and find out.
* I'm driving home feeling pretty good and humming along to my spotify playlist when I realize the song is ""Welcome to New York"" and I'm about to lose it again and fighting back tears. I'm seriously pathetic I know. It's ridiculous. Maybe my period's coming soon I don't know.
* B & I cook a HelloFresh kit for dinner - they've been bombarding me with discounts, so I got 3 meals for just $21. I paid for it last week though so not including that in my total here.
* I have a hugely important interview tomorrow with a company that I would be very likely to join, CorpE. The opportunity is remote and I believe they could actually match my compensation. I spend the rest of my evening studying for this interview, stalking team members on LinkedIn, watching tech talks from the company, and reading interview advice on Glassdoor and Blind. 
* I also have another unhinged moment where I post a request on /r/PhotoshopRequest for the lol's
* I bought some... beano and hair extensions from Amazon. (**$33**) For the beano ya girl needs it and for the extensions.. I don't really know tbh I just wanted to try it 

**Day 5 Total: $173**

&#x200B;

**Day 6 - Friday**

* Finally I can sleep in a little more and take my time showering and walking Fluffy. It's a beautiful sunny morning. 
* The HM interview with CorpE goes SO well. I know I have it in the bag. The HM seems impressed by my background and it's a really good fit with the team. Just as I thought, about an hour later I get the email that CorpE wants to move forward with a technical interview. My dreams are in reach once more!
* I fire off emails to all the other companies I'm in the process with, telling them I have an offer from CorpA to hopefully kick some wheels into gear. Even CorpF, which has really been dragging their feet on scheduling. Advice taken from [this negotiation article](https://haseebq.com/my-ten-rules-for-negotiating-a-job-offer/) that is the bible of my job hunt. 
* I tip the lovely wizards on /r/PhotoshopRequest for completing my requests. (**$35**)
* Now for the call with CorpA. The recruiter offers a tiny bump in the salary and I officially turn down the offer. I feel really bad. They really did want me and treated me well. It just doesn't make sense for me to take a >$100k pay cut, not to mention B doesn't have a job in NY yet. I thank her and the team profusely for being good to me, and that it was purely the compensation for why I didn't join. 
* I have 1 final technical interview with CorpD in the afternoon. I have a good rapport with the interviewer and I think I solved the problem - maybe not optimally, but he seemed satisfied with my work. 
* B comes home. I recently found out that Whole Foods has $1 oysters on Friday, and as an oyster fanatic I demand we go. Of course, once we're there we also pick up some other groceries. This is actually my first time at this Whole Foods, I usually go to Trader Joe's or the Asian market. (**$58** for my half). Then it's oysters and another HelloFresh meal for dinner.
* B has been suggesting, for my mental state and for something to look forward to, that I book a trip to New York for the holidays anyways. Then if we can move it'll be an apartment-hunting trip, if not it will just be a vacation. I finally have the motivation to plan so I book our flights. The departing flight costs me 20k Southwest rapid reward points, and I pay **$189** for the returning flight. On second thought I probably should have paid with points the other way around because I might cancel the return flight. As I have the companion pass, B flies with me for just an **$11** fee. Fluffy will cost an extra $200 as my carry-on but I'll pay that once we actually get to the airport.
* For housing in NY, we will be subleasing from a friend. I venmo her **$1800** and tell B that his share is my Christmas gift to him.

**Day 6 Total: $2093**

&#x200B;

**Weekly Totals**

|**Category**|**Amount**|
|:-|:-|
|Food + Drink|$433|
|Travel|$2809|
|Clothes + Beauty|$162|
|Dog supplies|$140|
|Other|$35|
|**Weekly Total**|**$3579**|

&#x200B;

**Lastly, reflect on your diary!** 

I think this was a pretty unusual week spending-wise given all the vacation expenses coming in. Luckily that's the majority of the vacation expenses paid off for the rest of the year, so I'm not anticipating any other big-ticket travel spending there. We've been really frugal the last couple months to try and save up for a moving-to-NY fund. The food feels like a lot, I usually don't eat out that much, but I guess catering sushi for everyone was a big part of that. I've been trying to do more things like that, pay for people's food and being a good host. It's truly bringing me so much joy. My friends do offer to chip in but I don't think they know how much I really make, given how young we all are. I just tell them I'm doing well at work and would like to share the good fortune.

I know I'll probably get roasted for not donating more and that's fair. That's completely right. Knowing that I'll get roasted puts more peer pressure on me, so thank you for that. I'll up my contributions soon!

I think it also helped to put everything into perspective writing this all down. It really wouldn't be the end of the world if I can't move. We'd save a lot of money here, and I'm sure we'll be able to make it happen in a year or two. I need to not take what I have for granted. I'm so privileged to even be able to dream of doing this.

Anyways, thanks for reading and I hope it was somewhat entertaining and a look into the hiring processes for tech. Or feel free to roast me for being privileged and out of touch and try to beat some sense into me so I'm not a crying mess every day lol. Happy to answer more questions about the interview process but I wouldn't consider myself a career guru, I know I've just been very lucky. "

Sometimes stretching thousands of kilometers, atmospheric rivers transport moisture away from the tropics to other parts of the globe. They are a necessary part of the global weather cycle and can bring needed rains to drought-stricken areas. But they can also contribute to dangerous flooding.

""The Greenland ice sheet has seen an acceleration in glacial melt over the last 30 years,"" says Mattingly. ""Our research shows the major impacts atmospheric rivers can have over the northeast part of the ice sheet.""

Greenland is covered by a 3,000-meter (9,800-foot) thick ice sheet that contains enough water to raise sea levels by 7 meters, or 23 feet. For millennia, it has played a major role in regulating Earth's temperature and climate, but that stability is at risk due to climate change.

Called assembly theory, the idea underpinning the pair’s strategy has even grander aims. As laid out in a recent series of publications, it attempts to explain why apparently unlikely things, such as you and me, even exist at all. And it seeks that explanation not, in the usual manner of physics, in timeless physical laws, but in a process that imbues objects with histories and memories of what came before them. It even seeks to answer a question that has perplexed scientists and philosophers for millennia: What is life, anyway?

Key breakthroughs include identifying the presence of multiple cargo proteins carried by the virus, including finding a protein that occupies both the head and tail of the virus. This discovery allows the team to predict a mechanism for how the virus injects its DNA into its bacterial target.

A new protein fold was also identified that acts as a ""gatekeeper""—controlling what is transported in and out of the viral particle. Additionally, the team are now able to assign functions to viral genes which were designated as hypothetical until now.

After controlling for other factors, researchers still saw benefits from deep sleep. This suggests that deep sleep contributes to salvaging memory function even in the face of brain pathology.

Researchers have created a clever algorithm that can “eavesdrop” on satellite signals to pinpoint any location on Earth, much like GPS. The study showed for the first time that the algorithm could take advantage of signals sent by multi-constellation low Earth orbit satellite (LEO) satellites, such as Starlink, OneWeb, Orbcomm, and Iridium.

By listening to signals from eight LEO satellites for about 10 minutes, the algorithm was able to pinpoint a stationary receiver on the ground with incredible accuracy, making an error of only about 5.8 meters.

The sheer magnitude of the October 2021 die-off, when thousands, possibly millions, of herring washed up, is what sticks in the minds of the residents of Kotzebue, Alaska. Fish were “literally all over the beaches,” says Bob Schaeffer, a fisherman and an elder from the Qikiqtaġruŋmiut tribe.

Despite the dramatic deaths, there was no apparent culprit. “We have no idea what caused it,” says Alex Whiting, the environmental-program director for the Native Village of Kotzebue. He wonders if the die-off was a symptom of a problem he’s had his eye on for the past 15 years: blooms of toxic cyanobacteria, sometimes called blue-green algae, that have become more and more noticeable in the waters around this remote Alaska town.

With two out of every three homes in America already underinsured, skyrocketing prices may tempt homeowners to cut back even further on disaster coverage, putting them at significant risk when severe weather strikes.

They may also forgo additional coverage that they need more than ever. While mortgage lenders typically require homeowners to carry home insurance, most policies do not cover floods. With budgets tight, Mr. Hosfield anticipates that more homeowners will opt out of insurance for flood damage. “And that puts them in a pretty bad spot,” he said.

The body also goes into flight or flight mode, meaning that the parasympathetic nervous system takes over in the build up to jumping. A June 2013 study published in the journal Physiology & Behavior found that both first time skydivers and those who were more experienced had similarly elevated salivary cortisol levels. “These findings support previous research demonstrating that skydiving elicits acute cortisol activation,” write the study authors.

Additionally, an April 2019 study published in the journal Biological Psychology found that levels of testosterone in the body were also impacted by skydiving. As cortisol levels increased so too did levels of testosterone, especially in “adventure seeking” individuals...

“The first place to look is our food supply, but we also need to look at environmental toxins, such as plastics, pesticides, other chemicals, etc.,” Dr. Christopher Palmer, an assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School specializing in the connection between metabolism and mental health, who was not part of the study, wrote on Twitter. “Something in our environment is poisoning our mitochondria.”

Mitochondria, the tiny organs within a cell, play a central role in energy metabolism by converting energy from food into a form the body can use.

Dr. Anders Rehfeld, a Danish researcher in human sperm physiology, shares the same concern and notes the decline in sperm counts over the past 40 years. He wrote on Twitter that “such rapid, widespread changes clearly suggest environmental causes.”

Some may know this landscape includes the earliest evidence of human occupation in what is now Australia, at Madjedbebe, where signs of habitation have been dated to 65,000 years ago.

Most people, however, ignore the expansive floodplains surrounding these sites, especially when they are covered by water during the wet season.

Our research, recently published in PLOS One, shows these floodplains hide a complex landscape buried deep underground critical to understanding the deep history of the region. We have mapped the cliffs and rivers, more than 15 metres below the current surface, which would have greeted the first people to arrive here.

Wolf is concerned that the amount of interaction we have with our screens and devices — and the speed at which we necessarily have to function — has changed us by removing from us the ability to be present.

“We have all changed. We don’t even realize it, but there’s a patience that’s needed inside ourselves to give attention to inference, empathy, critical analysis. It takes effort. And we’re so accustomed to going so fast that the immersiveness is difficult.”

Capturing attention

Kai Lukoff is an assistant professor at Santa Clara University in the U.S., where he directs the Human-Computer Interaction Lab. He researches how apps, platform and technology designers attempt to capture a user’s attention.

Air pollution from oil and gas production causes huge health impacts across the United States, a new study says

Emissions from the petroleum industry contributed to 7,500 excess deaths, 410,000 asthma attacks and 2,200 new cases of childhood asthma in 2016

These health impacts cost the United States $77 billion a year, researchers estimate

Meaning  This study suggests that health care cyberattacks such as ransomware are associated with greater disruptions to regional hospitals and should be treated as disasters, necessitating coordinated planning and response efforts.

Abstract

Importance  Cyberattacks on health care delivery organizations are increasing in frequency and sophistication. Ransomware infections have been associated with significant operational disruption, but data describing regional associations of these cyberattacks with neighboring hospitals have not been previously reported, to our knowledge.

Being this massive makes it an ultramassive black hole.[10]

According to a black hole calculator, it would have a radius of about 207 billion km or a diameter of 414 billion km. The event horizon of this thing can fit 11 Solar Systems side by side, so large that it would take light a week to reach the singularity after crossing the event horizon. But in reality, it is probably even larger. Since TON 618 is so far away, we only see how it looked like 10 billion years ago.[1]
https://kurzgesagt.fandom.com/wiki/TON_618

But, in terms of physical activity levels, we were able to show that participants who commuted 3 km or less appeared to be more physically active. This could be because this distance made it easier to commute by bicycle or foot to work – or because a shorter commute gave participants time before and after work to exercise.

n Singapore have developed the world’s smallest LED (light emitting diode) that enables the conversion of existing mobile phone cameras into high-resolution microscopes.

Smaller than the wavelength of light, the new LED was used to build the world’s smallest holographic microscope, paving the way for existing cameras in everyday devices such as mobile phones to be converted into microscopes via only modifications to the silicon chip and software. This technology also represents a significant step forward in the miniaturisation of diagnostics for indoor farmers and sustainable agriculture.

The Climate Change Authority (CCA), a federal government body, recently began a report with these words: “Time has run out to avoid dangerous climate change by reducing emissions alone.”

The subject of the paper was carbon sequestration, and its purpose was to reveal that limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius is now possible only if we find a way to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Emissions reduction alone won’t be enough.

This was the first time anyone from the government has mentioned this.

Responsible research

Both GMOs and gene-edited foods offer great promise. Of course there are valid concerns, such as the potential to create new allergens, unintended consequences for ecosystems, and growing corporate control over food. But these can be addressed through responsible research and regulatory frameworks.

Ultimately, the development of future foods must be guided by a commitment to sustainability, social justice and scientific rigour.

More than two-dozen scientists, including Northwestern University’s Erica Hartmann, have issued a warning about the overuse of antimicrobial chemicals.

The COVID-19 pandemic boosted the unnecessary use of these products, many of which are linked to health problems, antimicrobial resistance and environmental harm. In a new critical review, the scientists specifically cite the use of quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs), which are increasingly marketed and used in home, health care, educational and workplace settings — despite the availability of safer alternatives, including plain soap and water.

For more than 500 years, the empire’s military might and sociopolitical complexity allowed the Hittites to control the strategic region straddling eastern Anatolia and the northern Levant.

But by about 1200 B.C., the empire had collapsed. Researchers have cited armed conflict, disease, and political crises as contributing to its decline. Evidence hidden in ancient juniper trees points to what may have triggered that domino effect of calamities: a prolonged drought.

A federal appeals court ruled Tuesday that the Environmental Protection Agency must regulate perchlorate, reversing a Trump-era rollback on a drinking water contaminant linked to brain damage in infants.

A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled unanimously in an appeal brought by the Natural Resources Defense Council last year after the EPA, under the Biden administration, stood by the rollback. Two judges wrote that the EPA had no authority to withdraw from a 2011 determination that perchlorate should be regulated.

Circuit Judge Florence Pan, in a concurring opinion, went further. She called the EPA’s decision not to regulate perchlorate “arbitrary” and “capricious” and rejected the agency’s assertion that perchlorate was occurring at lower levels than previously thought. That assertion relied on a ”biased dataset that was selectively updated,” wrote Pan, who was appointed by President Joe Biden last year.

Common food additives known as metal oxide nanoparticles may have negative effects on your gut health, according to new research from Binghamton University, State University of New York and Cornell University.

Gretchen Mahler, professor of biomedical engineering and interim vice provost and dean of the Graduate School, worked in collaboration with Cornell researchers to study five of these nanoparticles. Their findings were recently published in the Journal of Antioxidants.

“They’re all actual food additives,” said Mahler. “Titanium dioxide tends to show up as a whitening and brightening agent. Silicon dioxide tends to be added to foods to prevent it from clumping. Iron oxide tends to be added to meats, for example, to keep that red color. And zinc oxide can be used as a preservative because it’s antimicrobial.”

However, with Russia’s war in Ukraine and the rise in cybersecurity activity over the past few years, the FBI has increased its monitoring of Russian cyber threats.

While the Snake malware is an elegantly designed piece of code, it is complex and needs to be precisely deployed to avoid detection. According to the Department of Justice’s press release, Russian cyber spies were careless in more than a few instances and did not deploy it as designed.

As a result, the Americans discovered Snake, and crafted a response.

Snake bites

The FBI received a court order to dismantle Snake as part of an operation code-named MEDUSA.

They developed a tool called PERSEUS that causes the Snake malware to disable itself and stop further infection of other computers. The PERSEUS tool and instructions are freely available to guide detection, patching and remediation.

There are currently 11 schools in England and Northern Ireland officially affiliated with ACE, although experts expect there to be many more as the schools are notoriously isolationist, conservative and don't advertise themselves widely.

Consequently, cells may lack the ability to further boost autophagy to defend against other dangers, such as smoke inhalation or a viral or bacterial infection. This may help explain why air pollution increases a person's risk for a number of acute and chronic lung diseases, including lung cancer, interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

As part of the research, Crandall and his team also developed a new method of studying autophagy, which can support future studies on the subject. They used a combination of fluorescent dyes and a powerful imaging method, known as confocal microscopy, to document the amount of autophagy taking place inside individual cells.

Uncovered in Argentina’s southern Patagonia region, the gigantic species of long-necked herbivorous dinosaur would have weighed 50 tonnes and measured 30 metres in length – roughly equivalent to that of a blue whale.

Its bones were so big that they caused a van carrying them to a laboratory to tip over, with scientists naming the dinosaur ‘Chucarosaurus Diripienda’, meaning scrambled, after its remains were rolled around during the car accident.

Research carried out in conjunction with INTU, a manufacturer of boiling water taps, found there are minerals in hard water which inhibit flavour compounds forming.

But proteins in the milk lower the mineral content of the water, Professor Mackie says, and gives a brew extra flavour, especially when the water is hard.

'Flavour by and large is produced by the different compounds in tea including tannins in particular,' Professor Mackie says.

'The more minerals present in water the more difficult it is for these compounds to develop the flavour - resulting in the dull cuppas you get in hard water areas.

A Popular Sweetener Had A Worrying Impact on Generations Of Mice

Could the sweetened drinks we knock back make us feel a little more anxious? A 2022 study that looked at the effects of the artificial sweetener aspartame on mice suggested that it's a possibility that's worth investigating further.

Approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1981, aspartame is widely used in low-calorie foods and drinks. Today, it's found in nearly 5,000 different products, consumed by adults and children.

I am trained as a quantum engineer. Research in quantum mechanics is usually geared toward technology. However, and somewhat surprisingly, there is increasing evidence that nature – an engineer with billions of years of practice — has learned how to use quantum mechanics to function optimally. If this is indeed true, it means that our understanding of biology is radically incomplete. It also means that we could possibly control physiological processes by using the quantum properties of biological matter.

Fortunately, once I learned that it’s actually beneficial to do things you suck at, the only thing left behind was the sense of shame I’d attached to my perceived fitness failures.

In a popular BuzzFeed article, Anne Helen Petersen describes how millennials (people born between 1981 and 1996) became “the burnout generation”. She describes some of the stark consequences of edging towards burnout and identifies what she calls “errand paralysis”, marked by a struggle to do even simple or mundane tasks.

Many of the factors contributing to this burnout are rooted in the challenging job and economic conditions that millennials face, according to Petersen. She also describes “intensive parenting” as a contributing factor, because millennials have been relentlessly trained and prepared for the workplace by their parents. They have internalised the idea that they need to be working all the time or engaging in the never-ending pursuit of self-optimisation.

So, this was a unanimous ruling by the court that, in this Idaho case, the EPA had overstepped.

But the majority went much farther and went really a much deeper cut into the EPA's authority. What did they rule?

Coral Davenport:

Essentially, they said that the EPA, which, until yesterday, had the authority to regulate most of the wetlands in the United States to protect the wetlands and to punish anyone who had polluted them, sharply limited or sharply reduced the amount of wetlands that would be subject to federal protection.

It said, in order for a wetland to be subject to some — any kind of federal protection regulation, it has to directly join up to or be connected to a larger body of water. That might sound sort of obscure, but that decision really cuts out millions of acres, probably more than half the wetlands in the United States, from federal protection

Are flours made with pulses better for us?

One of our most unhealthy collective eating habits in the West is not having enough fibre in our diets. A diet high in fibre is associated with numerous health benefits, including a decreased risk of heart disease and early death.

You might worry that boosting your intake of fibre through whole foods, including fruit, vegetables, pulses and wholegrains, means having to sacrifice some of your favourite foods. But in recent years, manufacturers have introduced higher fibre alternatives to many of our traditionally low-fibre staples – including pastas, crisps, breakfast cereals and cereal bars. But are they any better than the foods they replace?

Many regions of the deep sea are currently being explored for the potential to mine them for minerals, but it is still largely unknown what actually lives on the seabed.

Two new papers have looked at all the published records for the species found in one of these zones, and found that its sea floor is likely far more diverse than realised. They estimate that between 6,000-8,000 species are waiting to be discovered, but also note that this is likely an underestimate.

Ocean circulation in the deep waters around Antarctica has slowed significantly over the past three decades, posing a threat to the climate system, according to a new study.

Ocean circulation has kept climate change in check by drawing heat from the sea surface down to its depths. As polar waters freeze, they expel salt, causing surrounding waters to grow more saline — and thus, heavier — and sink to the ocean floor. But rising temperatures are increasingly melting polar ice, disrupting this process.

A literature review published last month in the journal Frontiers in Built Environment, for example, looked at 100 recent studies on the topic and found that not one of them evaluated potential health costs of putting used plastic into roads, buildings, and other construction applications. Several studies addressed environmental implications, but mostly to highlight the potential to divert plastic waste from landfills.

According to Erica Cirino, lead author of the review and the communications manager for the nonprofit Plastic Pollution Coalition, it was these omissions that allowed the majority of the studies to portray putting discarded plastics into infrastructure as a “net positive.”

The shrinking homebuyer market

Owning a home is one of the main ways for the American middle class to accumulate wealth. Despite this, home ownership declined by 5.5.% between 2007 and 2016. Who owns these homes is even more divided based on race. From 2015 to 2019, homeownership among Black families in the U.S. was 41.7% and for white families 71.7%.

Simultaneously, large private investment firms started buying single-family homes often to flip the houses and rent them at higher rates. Although smaller investment groups often buy homes, the major impact on the market comes from large private institutions.

Though the study was small -- 12 participants -- it found that kombucha may help lower blood sugar levels in people with Type 2 diabetes. Fermented with bacteria and yeasts, the drink has been consumed in China since 200 B.C. but it has been embraced in the United States only since the 1990s, researchers said.

""Apple cider vinegar was really taking off and people were talking about it all the time and kombucha,"" said study author Dr. Daniel Merenstein, director of family medicine research at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. ""And they have a farmers market at Georgetown where they sell kombucha, so we just thought, this kombucha is more tasty, easier to drink than apple cider vinegar ... so that's really what got us to do this study.""

But better data alone will not reduce inequality, Wilkinson points out. Asked why he thinks SDG 10 is failing, he points to a reduction in inequality that occurred in high-income nations from the 1930s until the end of the 1970s, broadly because social movements challenged the state to play a bigger part in protecting vulnerable people. He thinks something like that will need to happen again. “Given the powerful interests involved,” he says. “I don’t know why anyone thought that a statement of goals such as the SDGs would succeed.”

Researchers are right to urge leaders to prioritize inequality. They would do even better to study the efforts of Pickett, Wilkinson and others, and determine the reasons why these did not bear fruit.

The study, published Monday in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine, looked at data from 27,857 survey participants between 1998 to 2016. About 15%, or 4,105, developed dementia during the study period, and all lived in areas of the US with higher concentrations of particle pollution than those who didn’t develop dementia, the researchers found. The study authors said it’s the first nationally representative study of the potential effects of particle pollution on dementia in the US, and the link to dementia was most robust in areas with pollution from agriculture and wildfires.

Low-cost, human-made river barriers, similar to those built by beavers, can protect communities at risk of flooding.

Our new research has found that such natural barriers intentionally increase water levels upstream to slow down river flow. These flood barriers are made of materials like logs, branches, mud, and leaves. They reduce downstream water levels by deliberately blocking the river and storing the water. They then slow down the river flow during a storm.

Is prompt engineering worth learning?

Beyond playing with some tips and tricks, formally learning how to write prompts seems a bit pointless for most people. For one thing, AI models are constantly being updated and replaced. Specific prompting techniques that work now may only work in the short term.

People looking to get rich from prompt engineering would be better advised to focus on pairing AI and problem formulation in their area of expertise. For example, if you’re a pharmacist you might try using generative AI to double check warning labels on prescriptions.

Along the way you’ll sharpen your expository writing, acquire the basic generative AI skills (which employers might appreciate), and maybe strike gold with a killer application for the right audience.

""Scalene first teases out where your program is wasting time,"" Berger says. It focuses on three key areas -- the CPU, GPU and memory usage -- that are responsible for the majority of Python's sluggish speed.

Once Scalene has identified where Python is having trouble keeping up, it then uses AI -- leveraging the same technology underpinning ChatGPT -- to suggest ways to optimize individual lines, or even groupings of code.

said that like the body diverts blood to the skin to help release heat, it would make sense for energy to be diverted from the brain.

“Anything away from homeostasis, the brain is going to not be happy and react in some way,” she said. With heat stroke, for example, one symptom is central nervous system dysfunction, “which just means the person is not making good decisions.”

Heat also makes the body sweat and lose nutrients, which play a role in self-regulation and mental health. “It’s like we’re trying to run the machine using the wrong fuel, or at least using an improper balance of fuel,” Taliercio said.

In a lecture available on YouTube, behavioral ecologist Michael Pardo from Colorado State says his team's findings potentially ""blur the line"" between ""what we think is unique to human language versus what is found in other animal communication systems.""

Elephants are known for their loud, trumpet-like vocalizations, but the vast majority of their communication can't actually be heard by humans.

Instead, these large mammals mostly produce low-frequency rumbles, which can deliver messages to the feet of other elephants as far as six kilometers away.

Elephants spend the vast majority of their day in search of food, and it's not uncommon for the herd to lose sight of each other in that endeavor. Calling each other by names would be a useful way to keep tabs on the herd.

To explore that possibility, Pardo and his colleagues spent hours recording elephant rumbles in the wild, at two separate locations in Kenya.

Pyrolysis involves heating a material to high temperatures — in this case, 662 to 932 degrees Fahrenheit (350 to 500 degrees Celsius) — to chemically break down the molecules into smaller pieces. This heat treatment boosted the stability of the coffee grounds and prevented them from releasing chemicals that sabotaged the hydration reactions.

But coffee biochar also has a few important structural advantages.

""The coffee biochar retains the memory of the original waste material — its porosity and permeability,"" Savastano said. ""These properties play a key role in the mechanical performance, and consequently the durability of cement-based materials like concrete.

The evolution of fever is a classic conundrum because fever’s effects seem so harmful. Besides making you feel uncomfortable, you may also worry you’ll dangerously overheat. It is also metabolically costly to generate that much heat.

In our research and review, we propose that since fever occurs throughout much of the animal kingdom, this costly response must have benefits or it never would have evolved or been retained across species over time. We highlight several important but rarely considered points that help explain how the heat of fever helps your body fight infections.

“I think there are two different ways to think about the intersection of poverty and nutrition promotion,” Bauer said. “The first is that in addition to having proven positive effects on child nutrition, food assistance programs—like school meals—reduce poverty generally, which has widespread benefits for families. The second is that poverty reduction programs—like the child tax credit—have direct positive influences on children’s nutrition. It’s been shown that when low-income families are provided more cash assistance, they use it to buy healthier foods for their kids.”

While protected areas have undoubtedly contributed to slowing the overall biodiversity loss, it is unclear how well they work across multiple species concurrently. To explore this, researchers at the University of Helsinki examined changes in the occurrence of hundreds of species within and outside of protected areas.

Overall, the study findings showed a significantly positive association between the duration of sedentary behavior and incident dementia in older adult individuals. The associations between increased levels of sedentary behavior and new-onset dementia remained strong post-adjustment for the duration of device-measured moderate to vigorous physical exercise.

The study findings are in line with previous studies and indicate that increased time spent sedentary is linked to lower cognitive performance.

More about Dai’s studies on natural bioremediation

The current study using fungus to remove microplastics is compatible with Dai’s previous research using fungus to remediate PFAS or “forever chemicals” in the environment.

“Fungi have unique environmental applications due to their diversity and robustness,” Dai said. “They have also been useful in our ability to develop a novel bioremediation technology for these chemicals, which can threaten human health and ecosystem sustainability.”

PFAS are used in many applications ranging from food wrappers and packaging, to dental floss, fire-fighting foam, nonstick cookware, textiles and electronics.

Dai’s new technology uses a plant-derived material to absorb the PFAS and dispose of them by means of microbial fungi that literally eat them.

Detecting where matter just after the Big Bang can reveal early particle interactions that occurred during the inflation that followed, a moment when the universe expanded exponentially fast for a mere fraction of a second. If we view the galaxies as the petrified remains of these earliest moments, we can search for hints of particle physics in the super early universe, Philcox said.

Searching for a cosmic laundromat

Supermassive black holes are enormous, measuring roughly the width of the solar system, so it can take a photon around six days travelling at the speed of light to make an orbit. At the end of these six days, photons can either perform a U-turn to make another orbit, or fly into or away from the black hole. The photons that slip a black hole's gravity emerge in the form of an ultrathin halo around the pure black chasm: a photon sphere.

The discovery of trilobites at such a time and place is not too surprising. However, what was unexpected was the diversity and abundance within this core.

Normally, cored rocks only have a small area for fossils to be captured so usually there's little chance of hitting a fossil, let alone something useful for identification. Yet, in this sequence trilobites were so abundant that almost every single layer of rock contained a fragment. In fact, the rock is entirely made of trilobites in places, stacked one on top of each other, like a pack of playing cards!

The sources of these emissions have changed over recent decades. Emissions of NOx and VOCs from vehicles have fallen significantly, however consumer and industrial volatile chemical products (VCPs) are an increasing source of VOC emissions.

VCPs include a number every-day products, such as paint, domestic cleaning agents and perfume, and are a large source of VOC emissions in densely populated urban areas.

Every product releases a different set of VOCs into the air, leaving behind a kind of ‘chemical fingerprint’. These chemicals then interact with one another in the air, sometimes creating new pollutants in a process known as ‘secondary formation’.

Late last year, Caltech researchers revealed that they had developed a new fabrication technique for printing microsized metal parts containing features about as thick as three or four sheets of paper.

Now, the team has reinvented the technique to allow for printing objects a thousand times smaller: 150 nanometers, which is comparable to the size of a flu virus. In doing so, the team also discovered that the atomic arrangements within these objects are disordered, which would, at large scale, make these materials unusable because they would be considered weak and ""low quality."" In the case of nanosized metal objects, however, this atomic-level mess has the opposite effect: these parts can be three-to-five-times stronger than similarly sized structures with more orderly atomic arrangements.

We Can't See the First Stars Yet, but We Can See Their Direct Descendants

If you take a Universe worth of hydrogen and helium, and let it stew for about 13 billion years, you get us. We are the descendants of the primeval elements. We are the cast-off dust of the first stars, and many generations of stars after that.

Researchers have uncovered a simple structure from the Stone Age that may be the oldest evidence yet of early humans building with wood.

The construction is basic: a pair of overlapping logs, fitted together with a notch. It's nearly half a million years old and provides a rare look at how ancient human relatives were working with wood and changing their environments, authors wrote in a study published Wednesday in Nature.

The disease dates back centuries, but researchers say the booming popularity of countertops made of engineered stone, which has much higher concentrations of silica than many kinds of natural stone, has driven a new epidemic of an accelerated form of the suffocating illness. As the dangerous dust builds up and scars the lungs, the disease can leave workers short of breath, weakened and ultimately suffering from lung failure.

Einstein’s theory of gravity — general relativity — has been very successful for more than a century. However, it has theoretical shortcomings. This is not surprising: the theory predicts its own failure at spacetime singularities inside black holes — and the Big Bang itself.

People eat healthy meals and then ruin them with naughty snacks, scientists have discovered. A quarter of the participants in the King’s College London study ate unhealthy snacks between their nutritious meals.

Despite choosing healthy options for main meals, bad snacks left participants hungry and with poorer health markers. Picking at sweet treats, crisps and cakes was linked with a higher risk of obesity, strokes and cardiovascular disease.

ChatGPT just got chattier.

Users can now talk out loud to the AI chatbot and it will answer back with its own synthesised voice.

The feature is part of an upgrade to the mobile app and follows in the footsteps of voice assistants such as Amazon's Alexa and Apple's Siri.

ChatGPT has been given five different voices – both male and female - that were trained on actors hired by OpenAI, the US company behind the technology.
The firm claims they are far more realistic than rival voice assistants – and is looking at allowing users to create their own in the future.

""The study is important both in terms of how we understand voter behavior and the discussion about how the Swedish election system is designed,"" notes Axel Cronert, Docent in Political Science and one of the researchers behind the study.

There is a lack of studies into how queues affect turnout in countries like Sweden, which traditionally have very high voter turnout. A few studies in other countries have shown that long queues at the polling stations can frighten away voters looking to cast a ballot. In Sweden, long queues have historically been unusual, but during the general elections in 2022 reports came in of significant queues.

***Essays/LORs/Other:*** 

I am still workshopping my essays, but two consistent ideas that've consistently come up are leading a team of child-lobbyists on Capitol Hill for JDRF, and writing/producing my audio drama as a way to express a personal experience relating to themes which aren't getting spoken about nearly enough in realistic ways in major media (mental and emotional health in teenagers)! 

As for my LORs, I'm decently certain they'll be of high quality! I've got a handful of teachers I'm very close with, including two I've worked with for all three years of high school thus far, and a handful I've worked with for two years! For instance, one of those aforementioned teachers wrote a letter of recommendation for my Eagle Scout application, and my scoutmaster informed me it was one of the most thorough ones she's read!

  
Schools: 

I am planning on applying for USC early action (my absolute top school by a solid mile), as well as UCLA early action. I'm torn on whether to risk applying ED to Emory (my second choice)/Northwestern and being unable to attend USC if I get into both, but I'm going to be hinging this decision on how this year's AP's and awards pitter out for me! I've also considered UPenn and Brown, but both schools would require me to sacrifice a decent chunk of focus on either cinematic arts or business respectively (plus, ivies are no cakewalk to get into)!

&#x200B;

Thank y'all so much for reading this! Sorry if it's a bit (or a lot) long, but I hope that makes all the details as clear as possible! If there's any questions you have, feel free to let me know and I'd be happy to answer them! "

The matlab course itself has horrible lectures that do NOT provide me with any sort of useable information and for the most part I am reduced to guessing, asking gpt or other students and well, geussing.

I know that programming requires practice a lot but practice without knowing the methods or having a rough idea of what to do is like blind practicing a sport or an instrument with no teacher or course. You get disproportionately little results if at all since you are also likely to get it all wrong.

To put it more drastically, ""just start coding bro"" is like making 100 chimps type randomly on typewriters hoping that by chance they will write Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet."

Whether or not people choose to attend a climate protest partly depends on its expected size. When they expect a larger protest, they are less likely to take part—as Universität Hamburg's Cluster of Excellence for climate research (CLICCS) shows in a publication in the journal Nature Climate Change.

Mass protests are an important motivator for politicians to implement ambitious climate policy. But what determines whether a protest movement grows or dwindles? The study at hand uses the example of the global climate strike from 2019 to show that, for many people in Germany, their participation depends on how many people they expect to attend a given demonstration. Accordingly, Fridays for Future's strategy—organizing multiple local protests at the same time, instead of one massive centralized event—can successfully motivate more people.

As sea levels rise – due to climate change and other natural factors – the “salt line,” a natural barrier where inland water meets the ocean’s salty water, is shifting. While shifts in this line are natural and have occurred for billions of years, it has recently shifted more inward, with seawater pushing the salt line further inland as it takes over. This poses a huge threat to our drinking water.

""As a country, we need to trust the institutions that we have in place and call them to order when they breach the law,"" Angote said, making reference to government bodies that regulate GM foods.

""We should be confident that our health is in good hands.""

An official from LSK told AFP there had not been a decision on whether to appeal the ruling.

Another case against GM crops filed by Paul Mwangi, a lawyer who is close to the opposition, is still active in court.

Kenya, like many other African nations, banned GM crops over health and safety concerns and to protect smallholder farms, which account for the vast majority of rural agricultural producers in the country.

However, the East African powerhouse faced criticism over the ban, including from the United States, which is a major producer of GM crops.

Activists and agriculture lobby groups have protested over the lifting of the ban, saying it opened the market to US farmers using sophisticated technologies and highly subsidized farming that threatened the livelihoods of small-scale farmers.

The researchers determined that a subset of patients with long COVID had traces of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in their stool samples even months after acute COVID-19 infection, which suggests that components of the virus remain in the gut of some patients long after infection. They found that this remaining virus, called a viral reservoir, triggers the immune system to release proteins that fight the virus, called interferons. These interferons cause inflammation that reduces the absorption of the amino acid tryptophan in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.

Tryptophan is a building block for several neurotransmitters, including serotonin, which is primarily produced in the GI tract and carries messages between nerve cells in the brain and throughout the body. It plays a key role in regulating memory, sleep, digestion, wound healing, and other functions that maintain homeostasis within the body. Serotonin is also an important regulator of the vagus nerve, a system of neurons that mediate the communication between the body and the brain.

It appears that some studies prescribing resistance exercise interventions were not sufficiently loaded to bring about the structural adaptations required for tendon repair (Gatz 2020, Cho 2017). 

Interventions where resistance exercise was done less frequently, with rest days, had better outcomes for disability, pain, function and quality of life than those doing resistance exercises daily or more than once a day. This is consistent with strength training principles which call for rest days to encourage better adaptive processes in the mechanical properties of tendons before further loading occurs. The most common number of total repetitions was 45 (e.g., 3 sets of 15 repetitions) but we did not find any consistent patterns of dose-response on patient outcomes in our analysis of exercise volume. 

What are the key take-home points?

Clinicians prescribing resistance exercise should consider including higher intensities, that involve adding external weight, and should ensure adequate rest between sessions to facilitate recovery.  Although some patients may need a longer period to build up their intensity it is important to keep reviewing whether the load intensity is adequate to trigger improvements.

They identified that gene expression was significantly changed in calorie-restricted participants compared to controls, including genes related to protein regulation, circadian rhythm regulation, DNA repair, programmed cell death (apoptosis), and inflammation.

There were changes in biological pathways involved in muscle repair and skeletal muscle formation (myogenesis), leading to an increase in skeletal muscle quality and the mechanisms of aging. Some upregulated genes included those responsible for energy generation and metabolism, while downregulated inflammatory genes reduced inflammation.

The researchers say their findings highlight the mechanisms by which calorie restriction provides health benefits, especially in older people.

A brain-inspired computer chip that could supercharge artificial intelligence (AI) by working faster with much less power has been developed by researchers at IBM in San Jose, California. Their massive NorthPole processor chip eliminates the need to frequently access external memory, and so performs tasks such as image recognition faster than existing architectures do — while consuming vastly less power.

“Its energy efficiency is just mind-blowing,” says Damien Querlioz, a nanoelectronics researcher at the University of Paris-Saclay in Palaiseau. The work, published in Science1, shows that computing and memory can be integrated on a large scale, he says. “I feel the paper will shake the common thinking in computer architecture.”

Deforestation for rubber cultivation has been ""substantially underestimated"", and is two to three times higher than generally assumed, a new study said Wednesday.

Using satellite data and cloud computing, scientists said they compiled the first detailed accounting of deforestation for rubber production in Southeast Asia—which accounts for most of global production.

It suggests more than four million hectares of forest have been lost since 1993, and reveals that rubber has been planted in areas that are key for biodiversity.

But as it turns out, the company’s servers were not hacked. Rather, hackers targeted hundreds of individual user accounts — allegedly those that had weak or repeated passwords. After gaining access to the accounts, hackers could leverage the “DNA relatives matches” function of 23andMe to get information about thousands of people who didn’t use the service.

The power of water

Tidal power has great potential because water is such a potent power source. It is nearly 1,000 times more dense than air, so the energy is far more concentrated.

And it has another big advantage over renewable technologies like wind and solar - the tides are predictable.

Wind and solar power are increasingly cheap to deploy, but only work when the sun is shining or the wind is blowing.

Tidal power, on the other hand, can deliver a steady, reliable stream of energy day in, day out.

The Rising Threat of Thyroid Cancer

The global incidence and mortality rates of thyroid cancers have increased significantly in recent decades. There has been an average of 3.6% increase in thyroid cancer incidence per year in the United States between 1974 and 2013. A similar induction has been observed in China, Italy, and Turkey. Among 10 – 19-year-olds in the United States, about a 4.4% increase in the incidence rates of differentiated thyroid cancers (follicular and papillary thyroid cancers) per year has been reported between 1998 and 2013.

""Scientists have a moral obligation to clearly warn humanity of any catastrophic threat and to 'tell it like it is.'""

“Without actions that address the root problem of humanity taking more from the Earth than it can safely give, we’re on our way to the potential collapse of natural and socioeconomic systems and a world with unbearable heat and shortages of food and freshwater,” study lead co-author and former Oregon State University College of Forestry postdoctoral researcher Christopher Wolf said in a statement.

A study last month in the journal Science Advances arrived at a similar conclusion. It noted that there are nine planetary boundaries that humanity cannot exceed if life on Earth is to remain sustainable. Climate change is only one of those boundaries, and it is one that humanity is obviously exceeding. Yet we are also at existential risk for six of the nine categories, including land system change, freshwater change, biosphere integrity, novel entities (like plastics, pesticides, industrial chemicals, etc.) and the flows of biological and geological chemicals.

The moth is not only destructive, it also reproduces at a high rate. A single cream-colored female moth with its thin antennae and brown zigzag-striped wings can lay 1,000 eggs, according to the department.

Washington state officials have largely been able to keep the spongy moth at bay by spending roughly $1 million on early detection and eradication.

Officials speculate that the high number this year is due to people resuming travel after the pandemic and inadvertently moving spongy moth egg masses from the Eastern U.S. into Washington,

Current valuation methods for forest conservation projects have come under heavy scrutiny, leading to a crisis of confidence in carbon markets. This is hampering efforts to offset unavoidable carbon footprints, mitigate climate change, and scale up urgently needed investment in tropical forest conservation.

Measuring the value of carbon storage is not easy. Recent research revealed that as little as 6% of carbon credits from voluntary REDD+ schemes result in preserved forests. And the length of time these forests are preserved is critical to the climate benefits achieved.

Now, a team led by scientists at the University of Cambridge has invented a more reliable and transparent way of estimating the benefit of carbon stored because of forest conservation.

The method is published today in the journal Nature Climate Change. In it, the researchers argue that saving tropical forests is not only vital for biodiversity, but also a much less expensive way of balancing emissions than most of the current carbon capture and storage technologies.

A new study led by researchers at Barrow Neurological Institute has found that people living in regions with median levels of air pollution have a 56% greater risk of developing Parkinson's disease compared to those living in regions with the lowest level of air pollution.

The study, published in Neurology, was conducted to identify national, geographic patterns of Parkinson's disease and test for nationwide and region-specific associations with fine particulate matter.

For example, a CT scan of the head or brain costs $132 for the 25th percentile provider while the same procedure costs $218 at the 75th percentile provider, according to researchers from Bentley University, Brown University, and the IU Paul H. O'Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs. The variation in price exists for a variety of shoppable as well as non-shoppable services.

The researchers say that high price variation in health care may be a result of differing levels of quality but also may reflect anticompetitive contracts or consolidation. The findings of the report ""Transparency in Coverage Data and Variation in Prices for Common Health Care Services,"" are published in the journal JAMA Health Forum.

Digging new ponds and resurrecting old ""ghost ponds"" can be done by landowners to revitalize biodiversity in natural and farmland landscapes, say UCL researchers in a new how-to guide for turning degraded ponds into thriving ecosystems.

The ""Guide to the restoration, creation and management of ponds,"" developed by the UCL Pond Restoration Research Group in conjunction with the Freshwater Habitats Trust and Norfolk Ponds Project, is designed to help landowners, farmers and other stewards of the land to manage existing ponds, restore degraded ponds and determine the best ways to create new ones.

During a recent research cruise off the southern coast of California, NOAA Fisheries divers and partners found a juvenile white abalone. It’s one of only three live juveniles observed in natural subtidal reefs along the California coast during the past 20 years. They once numbered in the millions, but are now endangered.

An international team of researchers has discovered that formaldehyde, a widely spread pollutant and common metabolite in our body, interferes in the epigenetic programming of the cell. This finding expands the knowledge of formaldehyde, previously considered only as a DNA mutagen, and helps establishing a further link with cancer.
""This substance is especially concentrated in various products used in construction, furniture manufacturing, the textile industry and some hair products,"" comments Dr. Esteller. Going a step further, Dr. Pontel stresses this vision pointing out that ""formaldehyde is not only a significant environmental hazard, often found in polluted fumes, but it can also be generated within our bodies through the metabolism of common dietary substances like the sweetener aspartame. Moreover, our cells are continually producing formaldehyde, a known mutagen that can lead to cancer.""

The team also learned that water returned to the aquifer by septic systems plays a major role in helping to limit saltwater intrusion. ""About 66% of the water that gets pumped out of the aquifer ends up returning to it,"" says Kirshen.

Diets that are more plant based, like the Mediterranean diet and traditional diets in China, Japan, and India, are shown to reduce risk, especially when compared to the Western diet. Alzheimer’s disease rates rise in these countries as they make the nutrition transition to the Western diet. This study identifies dementia risk factors including higher consumption of saturated fats, meat, especially red meat such as hamburgers and barbeque as well as processed meats such as hot dogs, and ultraprocessed foods high in sugar and refined grains.

Now, a new study led by Michael Cheeseman of Colorado State University and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration finds a very familiar story related to air pollution. In an essay written by Adam Voiland and featured on the NASA Earth Observatory website, Cheeseman said, “When you look at NASA satellite data across the United States and compare that to socioeconomic data about our schools, the picture is clear: Hispanic, Asian, and Black and African American public school children attend schools with higher concentrations of air pollution than white students, especially in urban areas.” There also seem to be strong correlations for poor communities, irrespective of race. The study was recently published in the journal GeoHealth, and is comprehensive assessment of over 98,000 public schools.

Misunderstanding As A Catalyst

While feeling understood is always desired, being misunderstood is an opportunity that can lead to personal growth and creativity. It’s a paradoxical idea, yet history is replete with examples of individuals who found their uniqueness and creativity in moments of profound misunderstanding.

When we’re misunderstood, we’re pushed out of our comfort zones and forced to confront our own uniqueness. In the words of Mignault, “We feel understood when others view how our emotions are normal and even desirable.” The paradox lies in the tension created by being misunderstood. Mignault’s research raises an intriguing question: Could embracing this discomfort be a catalyst for personal transformation?

At the pyramid's core, the team found what they described as 'meticulously sculpted' and 'massive' lava-stone structures made of andesite: a fine-grained kind of igneous rock.

This inner-most chamber, dubbed Unit 4, 'likely originated as a natural lava hill,' they wrote, 'before being sculpted and then architecturally enveloped during the last glacial period,' sometime between 16,000 to 27,000 years ago.

There is some evidence that increasing salt intake, as measured by sodium in urine may be linked to increased levels of the stress hormone cortisol. This has been linked to increased blood pressure and the reduced effectiveness of the hormone insulin.

Insulin normally controls blood glucose levels and is a key part of how type 2 diabetes develops. However, evidence for this mechanism has only been shown in rats.

The Environmental Protection Agency will review the use of a chemical found in tires that has been linked with the deaths of salmon on the U.S. West Coast.

Spurred by a petition from West Coast tribes, the EPA will study the impact of the rubber preservative 6PPD with an eye to potentially banning its use. Through normal wear and tear, tires shed tiny bits of rubber rich in 6PPD. The preservative reacts with ozone pollution to form 6PPD-q, which is toxic to fish. Rainfall washes the chemical from streets and parking lots into streams and rivers. In the Pacific Northwest, 6PPD-q has proved deadly to coho salmon.

Jane Scott of Newcastle University said, ""Our ambition is to transform the look, feel and well-being of architectural spaces using mycelium in combination with bio-based materials such as wool, sawdust, and cellulose.""

The scientists, in their research, mixed mycelium spores with other materials the spores could consume and be able to grow off of, like grains. The mixture was then placed into a warm, dark, and humid space while the mycelium grew and was then dried.

This process creates a building material that researchers say is a more natural replacement for foam, plastic or timber.

Scott says what is created is a ""lightweight, flexible, and formable"" material.

However, recent research has led the FDA to reconsider the safety of this food additive. Back in 1970, the FDA determined that BVO was no longer “Generally Recognized as Safe” (GRAS), leading to increased oversight and regulation of its use in food products. As a result, many beverage manufacturers gradually replaced BVO with alternative ingredients over the years. Consequently, BVO is currently found in very few beverages in the United States.

Who still uses uses BVO?

According to the Center for Science in the Public Interest, PepsiCo removed BVO from Gatorade in 2013, and both Coca-Cola and PepsiCo later announced they would remove the ingredient from all their beverages.

However, the Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit research and advocacy group focusing on consumer health, reports that 90 products on the market today still use BVO. The majority are different brands of orange soda. According to EWG’s list, brands including BVO include Food Lion sodas, some Great Value sodas, and Sun Drop citrus soda. Mountain Dew drinks are also mentioned on this organization’s list, but PepsiCo says they no longer use the ingredient in the popular drink.
According to the Environmental Working Group, this includes Sun Drop, made by Keurig Dr Pepper, as well as Orangette and Great Value Fruit Punch, made by Walmart.

""All of these risks of various types of natural disasters are correlated and increasing in frequency. And that presents a real problem for the insurance market. There's fundamental questions as to whether insurance as we know it is a sustainable business,"" said Angle.

The cost to insurance companies has skyrocketed over the years. Insurance agencies get their own insurance coverage, called reinsurance, to cover the risk of catastrophes. Those reinsurance rates have risen dramatically, too.

Angle says from 1964 to 1990, U.S. insurers paid out on average about $100 million a year for wildfires. Over the next 20 years, that number rose to $600 million a year. By 2018, wildfire insurance payouts were averaging almost $4 billion annually.

I have black hair, brown eyes, my skin tone is light brown, my height is 185cm/6’07” and my weight is 90kg/198lb. I'm not severely out of shape but I do have some weight to lose. I'm actively working on getting into better shape.  
\*\*About me\*\*  
I'm a kind and caring person (but not a r/niceguy!) and I'm initially looking for a partner to lose my virginity and have a good time with, but I'm open to repeating it or getting to know each other for something more (friendship, relationship, etc). If we meet again, I'm willing to explore my sexuallity and try some kinks too.  
Although I have no experience having sex, over the years curiosity has led me to learn a lot on the internet (I'm not talking about porn!).  
I'm a college student and I work as a freelancer.  
\*\*What I like\*\*  
Although I'm not a big drinker, I like to go out for a drink and to walk. I'm someone who values intimacy and sharing with others more.  
I'm passionate about learning new things (I'm very curious person), I like video games (I prefer narrative and cooperative games), I like listening to various songs and musical genres and I enjoy exploring new songs (I accept recommendations). I love ice cream and rainy days.  
Something I don't like: the lack of communication.  
\*\*Contact\*\*  
I'm not looking to pay anyone. If you ask me for money, I will block you.  
I would appreciate it if you could send me an introduction with some general things about you (age, location, some hobbies, etc). The idea is to talk a little, exchange photos (I'm not talking about nudes) and then make a video call to get to know each other. If everything went well, later we should organize a date and meet. If we don't live nearby, I am willing to meet in CABA or zona sur.  
If I catch your attention, don't hesitate to talk to me.  
Note: if this post is up then I’m still looking, so feel free to send me a message."
17twsb3,1,2023-11-12,Looking for other writing teachers who are structuring their courses around AI collaboration.,u/AlabasterTire,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/17twsb3/looking_for_other_writing_teachers_who_are/,"As a college writing instructor, I believe that some of my students are entering professions where generative AI is going to be a co-author for a lot of their future writing. I anticipate that prospective employers will expect them to use AI to write faster (and possibly better) than earlier generations of workers have been expected to write.  (How I feel about this shift is irrelevant--I think it's the reality my students are going to be entering, and I believe I have an obligation to prepare them to succeed in it.) I'm considering reworking my writing classes to teach my students to incorporate gen-AI in ways that elevate their final products above what ChatGPT can generate on its own and also what the students can generate on their own.  At that same time, I also need to teach them to write clearly on their own because some of them will be entering fields where privacy practices or company policy will not allow them to use generative AI. With these two considerations, I'm looking for ways to redesign my classes to meet both of these needs.   


I know other writing teachers must be doing this. If you're one of them, I'd love to chat with you about the principles and practices that undergird your instructional and assignment design and possibly to share actual assignments and methodologies. If you're interested in such a conversation, I'd love to talk either in this thread or via PM. I look forward to sharing ideas with you! "

I took my MCAT in 2019 and have been actively tutoring since. I've been trying to develop free and robust prompts and tools to help my students prep better for their exams. So far, having chatGPT re-write similar passages has been a super effective way of getting additional practice on troublesome/high-yield topics that we cover BUT

There has to be some other use cases. Thoughts on how to level this up?"

If you ask me to write code I would have no idea how. I used to be a very good student who had very good study habits in high school and a high average but unfortunately I came out of a very emotionally abusive home which caused me to deal with CPTSD and anxiety the following year in university and that, of course, hindered my ability to study. Being used to caring about grades I resorted to cheating to get them. How can I catch up? We’re learning about client-servers programming, template engines, C, bits and bitwise operations and frankly I don’t know how to do any of it, I know some knowledge but not how to code. I really love tech and whenever I’ve coded I did have fun and I would be so happy to get into the field. Now that I’ve healed a bit, I would really like some help and some advice, thank you. 

Tldr; I’ve cheated for the first year and a half of my comp sci degree trying to deal with trauma from an emotionally abusive household and would love to get back on track but have no clue where to start. I also feel uncomfortable asking the profs for help as I feel as though that’s suspicious"

Welcome to AI Unraveled, the podcast that demystifies frequently asked questions on artificial intelligence and keeps you up to date with the latest AI trends. Join us as we delve into groundbreaking research, innovative applications, and emerging technologies that are pushing the boundaries of AI. From the latest trends in ChatGPT and the recent merger of Google Brain and DeepMind, to the exciting developments in generative AI, we've got you covered with a comprehensive update on the ever-evolving AI landscape. In today's episode, we'll cover the future of computing with AI agents revolutionizing personal assistance, healthcare, education, productivity, and entertainment. We'll also discuss the integration of AI agents in popular productivity tools, the challenges associated with their development, and the urgent privacy concerns and societal impact they raise. And if you want to dive deeper into understanding artificial intelligence, we recommend checking out the book ""AI Unraveled"" available at Shopify, Apple, Google, and Amazon.

Software has come a long way since Paul Allen and I started Microsoft, but in many ways, it still lacks intelligence. Currently, to perform any task on a computer, you need to specify which app to use. While you can draft a business proposal with Microsoft Word or Google Docs, these apps cannot help you with other activities like sending an email, sharing a selfie, analyzing data, scheduling a party, or buying movie tickets. Furthermore, even the best websites have a limited understanding of your work, personal life, interests, and relationships. They struggle to utilize this information to assist you effectively, a capability currently only found in human beings such as close friends or personal assistants.

However, over the next five years, this will dramatically change. Instead of using different apps for different tasks, you will simply need to express your desires to your device in everyday language. Depending on the extent to which you choose to share personal information, the software will be able to respond on a personal level, having a comprehensive understanding of your life. In the near future, anyone with online access will be able to have a personal assistant powered by advanced artificial intelligence, surpassing the capabilities of current technology.

This kind of software, referred to as an agent, can comprehend natural language and perform various tasks based on its knowledge of the user. Although I have been contemplating the concept of agents for almost 30 years and even discussed them in my book ""The Road Ahead"" back in 1995, recent advancements in AI have made them a practical reality. Agents will not only revolutionize how we interact with computers but also disrupt the software industry, marking the most significant computing revolution since the transition from command typing to icon tapping.

Some critics have raised concerns about the viability of personal assistant software, citing previous attempts by software companies that were not well received. One such example is Clippy, the digital assistant included in Microsoft Office that was eventually dropped. However, the upcoming wave of AI agents is expected to be much more advanced and widely adopted.

Unlike their predecessors, AI agents will offer a more sophisticated and personalized experience. They will be capable of engaging in nuanced conversations and will not be limited to simple tasks like writing a letter. Comparing Clippy to AI agents is akin to comparing a rotary phone to a modern mobile device.

AI agents will have the ability to assist with various aspects of your life. By gaining permission to track your online interactions and real-world activities, they will develop a comprehensive understanding of your personal and professional relationships, hobbies, preferences, and schedule. You will have the freedom to decide when and how the agent intervenes to provide assistance or guidance.

Contrasting AI agents with current AI tools, which are often limited to specific apps and only offer help upon direct request, highlights the immense potential of agents. These agents will be proactive, making suggestions before you even ask for them. They will seamlessly operate across different applications and continuously learn from your activities, recognizing patterns and intentions to deliver personalized recommendations. It is important to note that the final decisions will always be made by you.

AI agents have the potential to revolutionize several sectors, such as healthcare, education, productivity, entertainment, and shopping. One of the most exciting aspects is their ability to democratize services that are currently too expensive for the majority of individuals. With AI agents, individuals will have access to personalized planning, without having to pay for a travel agent or spend hours explaining their preferences.

In conclusion, the upcoming era of AI agents promises a revolutionary and highly personalized experience. They will provide a level of assistance, intelligence, and convenience that surpasses previous attempts at personal assistant software.

Today, artificial intelligence (AI) plays a crucial role in healthcare by assisting with administrative tasks. Abridge, Nuance DAX, and Nabla Copilot are examples of AI technology that can record audio during appointments and generate notes for doctors to review.

However, the real transformation will occur when AI agents can provide basic triage assistance to patients, offer advice on managing health problems, and help individuals determine if medical treatment is necessary. Furthermore, these agents will support healthcare workers in making critical decisions and increasing productivity. Glass Health, for instance, is an app that can analyze a patient summary and propose potential diagnoses for doctors to consider. This advancement in AI will be particularly beneficial for individuals in underserved areas with limited access to healthcare.

Implementing clinician-agents in healthcare will require a cautious approach due to the potential life and death implications. People will need reassurance that the overall benefits of health agents outweigh the imperfections and mistakes they may make. It is important to recognize that humans also make errors, and lack of access to medical care is a significant issue.

Mental health care is another domain where AI agents can make a substantial impact by increasing accessibility. Currently, regular therapy sessions may be perceived as a luxury, yet there is a substantial unmet need. RAND research indicates that half of all U.S. military veterans requiring mental health care do not receive it.

AI agents trained in mental health will pave the way for more affordable and easily accessible therapy. Wysa and Youper are early examples of chatbots in this field, but the capabilities of future agents will delve even deeper. With your consent, a mental health agent could gather information about your life history and relationships, be available on demand, and provide unwavering patience. It could also monitor your physical responses to therapy through wearable devices like smartwatches, such as detecting an increased heart rate when discussing a problem with your boss and suggesting when it may be helpful to seek support from a human therapist.

The field of education has long been anticipating the ways in which software can enhance teachers' work and enable students to learn more effectively. While it is important to note that software will not replace teachers, it does have the potential to complement their efforts by personalizing content and alleviating administrative tasks. This transformative shift is now beginning to take place.

An example of the current state-of-the-art technology in education is Khanmigo, a text-based bot developed by Khan Academy. This innovative tool functions as a tutor in subjects such as math, science, and humanities. It can explain complex concepts like the quadratic formula and provide math problems for students to practice. Additionally, it supports teachers in tasks such as creating lesson plans. I have been an admirer and supporter of Sal Khan's work for a considerable time, and I had the pleasure of hosting him on my podcast recently, where we discussed developments in education and AI.

However, text-based bots are only the initial wave of educational agents. These agents will open up a host of new learning opportunities. Currently, many families cannot afford one-on-one tutoring for their children. If educational agents can understand what makes a tutor effective, they can make this kind of personalized instruction accessible for everyone. For instance, by leveraging a student's interests such as Minecraft and Taylor Swift, an agent could teach them about calculating the volume and area of shapes using Minecraft and explore storytelling and rhyme schemes through Taylor Swift's lyrics. Such an experience would be far more engaging, incorporating graphics and sound, and tailored to each student's specific needs, surpassing the capabilities of today's text-based tutoring.

In conclusion, the integration of intelligent agents into education holds great promise for personalized learning experiences. By leveraging technology effectively, we can revolutionize the way knowledge is imparted and enable students to thrive in their educational journeys.

In today's competitive landscape, numerous technology giants are venturing into the realm of productivity enhancements. Microsoft, for instance, is integrating its Copilot feature into widely-used applications like Word, Excel, Outlook, and others. Similarly, Google is leveraging its Assistant with Bard to bolster productivity tools. These copilots possess impressive capabilities, such as converting written documents into slide decks, providing natural language-based answers to spreadsheet queries, and summarizing email threads while representing individual perspectives.

However, the potential of productivity agents goes even further. Employing a productivity agent will be akin to having a dedicated personal assistant capable of independently undertaking a variety of tasks at your behest. For instance, if you possess a business idea, your agent will assist in crafting a comprehensive business plan, creating a compelling presentation, and even generating visualizations of your envisioned product. Companies will have the ability to make agents readily available for their employees, thereby enabling direct consultations and ensuring maximum engagement during meetings.

Regardless of the work environment, a productivity agent will offer support similar to that of personal assistants to executives today. If your friend undergoes surgery, your agent can offer to send flowers and handle the entire ordering process. In the scenario where you express a desire to reconnect with a college roommate, your agent will collaborate with their own agent to find a suitable meeting time. Prior to your meeting, it will kindly remind you that their oldest child recently commenced studies at a local university.

With the advent of productivity agents, individuals will experience a new level of efficiency and assistance, both in their professional and personal lives.

Already, artificial intelligence (AI) has the ability to enhance our entertainment and shopping experiences. AI can assist in selecting a new television and offer recommendations for movies, books, shows, and podcasts. Additionally, there are companies, including one that I have invested in, that have introduced AI-powered tools like Pix. This tool allows users to ask questions about their preferences and provides recommendations based on their past likes. Notably, Spotify has an AI-powered DJ that not only plays songs according to personal preferences but also engages in conversation and can even address users by their names.

In the future, AI agents will not only make recommendations but also help users take action. For example, if a user wants to buy a camera, their agent will read reviews, summarize them, offer a recommendation, and even place an order once a decision is made. If a user expresses interest in watching a movie like ""Star Wars,"" the agent will determine if they are subscribed to the appropriate streaming service and offer assistance in signing up if necessary. In cases where users are unsure of what they want to watch, the agent will provide customized suggestions and facilitate the playback of the chosen movie or show.

AI agents will also personalize news and entertainment content based on individual interests. CurioAI is an example of this, as it creates custom podcasts on any subject of interest. These advancements in AI agents will have significant implications for the software industry and society as a whole.

Agents will essentially become the next platform in the computing industry. In contrast to current practices where coding and graphic design skills are necessary to create new apps or services, users will simply communicate their desires to their agents. The agents will handle tasks such as coding, designing the app's appearance, creating a logo, and publishing the app to an online store. OpenAI's recent launch of GPTs provides a glimpse into a future where even non-developers can easily create and share their own AI assistants.

AI agents will revolutionize both how we use software and how it is developed. They will replace traditional search sites, offering superior information retrieval and summarization capabilities. E-commerce platforms will also face substitution as agents scout for the best prices available from various vendors. Ultimately, agents will replace word processors, spreadsheets, and other productivity applications. The integration of these functions will lead to the convergence of separate businesses, such as search advertising, social networking with advertising, shopping, and productivity software, into a unified entity.

While I believe that no single company will dominate the agent market, there will be numerous AI engines available. Although some agents may be free with ad support, most will be paid for. Companies, therefore, will be incentivized to ensure that agents prioritize user interests over advertisers. Given the remarkable amount of competition emerging in the AI field, the cost of agents is expected to be very affordable.

However, before we witness the full potential of sophisticated agents, we must address several questions regarding the technology and its usage. While I have previously discussed the broader AI concerns, I will now focus specifically on issues pertaining to agents.

The development of personal agents presents several technical challenges that are yet to be fully resolved. One major challenge is determining the most effective data structure for these agents. Currently, there is no consensus on what the ideal database for capturing and recalling nuanced information related to an individual's interests and relationships should look like. A new type of database that can accomplish this while still prioritizing privacy is needed.

In addition, the question of how individuals will interact with multiple agents remains open. Will personal agents be separate from other specialized agents like therapist agents or math tutors? If so, it raises the question of when these agents should collaborate and when they should operate independently.

Various options are being explored to facilitate interaction with personal agents. Companies are considering platforms such as apps, glasses, pendants, pins, and even holograms. However, it is speculated that earbuds may be the breakthrough technology for human-agent interaction. Personal agents could use earbuds to communicate with users, speaking to them or appearing on their phones when necessary. Earbuds could also enhance auditory experiences by blocking out background noise, amplifying speech, or improving comprehension of heavily accented speech.

Furthermore, there are several other challenges that need to be addressed. Currently, there is no standardized protocol that enables communication between different agents. The cost of personal agents needs to decrease to ensure accessibility for everyone. Prompting personal agents in a manner that yields accurate responses also requires improvement. Additionally, precautions must be taken to prevent hallucinations, particularly in areas like healthcare where accuracy is crucial. It is equally important to ensure that agents do not cause harm due to biases. Finally, steps should be taken to prevent agents from performing unauthorized actions. While concerns exist about rogue agents, the potential misuse of agents by human criminals is a more pressing worry.

The convergence of technology and the digital world brings forth pressing concerns regarding online privacy and security. As this fusion intensifies, the urgency to address these issues becomes paramount. It is essential that individuals have control over the information accessible to their digital agents, ensuring that their data is shared with trusted individuals and organizations of their choosing.

Yet, the matter of ownership arises. Who ultimately possesses the data shared with one's agent, and how can one guarantee its appropriate use? No one desires targeted advertisements based on private conversations with their therapist agent. Additionally, can law enforcement employ an individual's agent as evidence against them? Moreover, when should an agent refuse to carry out actions that may be detrimental to the individual or others? Who determines the core values ingrained in these digital agents?

Furthermore, the extent of information that an agent should divulge emerges as a significant question. For instance, if one intends to meet a friend, it is undesirable for the agent to disclose exclusive plans, which may convey a sense of exclusion. Similarly, when assisting with work-related tasks such as email composition, the agent must recognize the boundaries of privacy by refraining from utilizing personal or proprietary data from previous employments.

Many of these quandaries are already at the forefront of the tech industry and legislative agendas. Recently, I engaged in an AI forum organized by Senator Chuck Schumer, alongside other technology leaders and numerous U.S. senators. During this forum, we exchanged ideas, deliberated upon these issues, and stressed the necessity for robust legislative measures.

However, certain matters cannot be solely resolved by companies and governments. Digital agents could significantly impact our interactions with friends and family. Presently, expressing care for someone involves remembering meaningful details of their life, such as birthdays. Yet, when individuals become aware that their agents essentially prompted these gestures and took care of arrangements, will the sentiment remain as genuine for the recipient?

In the distant future, digital agents may instigate profound existential queries. Imagine a world where agents provide a high quality of life for everyone, rendering extensive human labor unnecessary. In such a scenario, what purpose would individuals seek? Would pursuing education still be desirable when agents possess all knowledge? Can a society truly prosper when leisure time becomes abundant for the majority?

Nevertheless, we have yet to reach that juncture. Meanwhile, the rise of digital agents is imminent. In the coming years, they will irrevocably transform our lives, both within the digital realm and offline.

17u2pnl,1,2023-11-12,"I've just wasted my whole life. I'm a failure, and now I don't know what to do next.",u/RegularUser02x,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/17u2pnl/ive_just_wasted_my_whole_life_im_a_failure_and/,"I'm on my 1st year of master's. I feel like I'm struggling with even the simplest tasks. The job that's considered easy is really difficult for me. My mind is numb. 

For the first time in all my years of studies I've missed a deadline and f*ed up the weekend spending every minute on my phone procrastinating. I'm having a test in a week and I have no idea how to prepare for as soon as I start I realize I'm wasting time, so why bother if I can submerge myself in YouTube or TikTok or Reddit etc and get the same results? I've had a test and made the most ridiculous mistakes that could have been easily avoided. 

I have insomnia now and have to go to uni in 3 hours. I really feel like I'll end up as McDonald's staff or a ""sanitary engineer"" or a janitor etc. I'm a failure that (objectively, according to my parents and teachers) used to be a genius. Not to brag but I was crazy about math and science, would participate in olympiads and solve every exercise in a book out of curiosity. I went to mysician school and learned piano. I had dreams, had goals, had some light in a tunnel... Now it's gone... 

Since I turned 18 I feel like I started becoming dumber and dumber. After I left high school my learning curve has dropped down, I no longer have neither energy nor interest in doing stuff. Heck, I have problems making up sentences and feel likfe a 5 y o child / super dumb kid. What's happened? I'm a lost case that is doomed to fail and feel like there's no escape. My bedroom is mess as never before and I mean REALLY mess. I'm still living with my mom, I've taken so much dumb decisions lately... 

I really need some help, exams are approachong, it all came as an avalanche on me. Even the simplest tasks are taking sooo long I'm DUMB. I do not understand what I read sometimes. I use chatGPT (which gives bs most of the time) and often times try to randomly regenerate until it works. I'm actually TRYING but to no avail... I feel like a loser that will never achieve anything in my life.

I never drank nor used drugs but still feel horrible. What can I possibly do?..

All in all, I guess it helps to speak out a bit, whatever happens next. Who cares what happens next? Wherever I find myself let it be... Maybe I'll live my whole life as the next light duty cleaner who knows? Maybe I'll just use my potential as a hobby because studying / working completely failed.

I'm not hired anywhere where I'd apply (internship / part time). Heck our library was hiring students for part time job as a librarian and I was refused an offer. I've fallen so hard. I was trying to get into IT which obviously failed. I feel like I've failed 4 years of my life. What's even the point? 

I've even thought on times about death and what happens after we die, but, I guess, I don't have guts to do it. Plus I don't want to be that ungrateful jerk who offs himself after having God (whether you believe in him or not) blessed me with life I have. But it's so hard and feels useless... I'm a disappointment in the eyes of everyone - mom, teachers, friends... I don't even know why I'm writing it here, most of you would scroll anyway. Nobody cares about me or anyone with similar problems. Oh, and did I tell you already that a therapist costs an arm and a leg? So that's not an option neither... I want to kove, forget about my past life and get employed as a very low skilled worker. I feel like some amoeba ate all my brain and the rest is consumed by dementia... I'm only 21...

I can't do it anymore. And if you made it so far, I'm grateful for you, your support, prayers for me. It's really meaningful to me. Peace."

Yann LeCun, a prominent figure in the AI field, has been instrumental in fostering the AI ecosystem in France. After leaving France 35 years ago, he established FAIR-Paris, providing opportunities for young scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs in AI research and development. His research is open and accessible to the global community [3]. LeCun's recent paper on role-playing with large language models, initially behind a paywall, is now freely available [4]. In 2016, he taught a course at Collège de France, which was a stepping stone for French students in their deep learning journey. Since 2018, FAIR-Paris has hosted 20 to 30 resident PhD students annually, graduating 5 to 10, contributing to the growth of the French AI research, development, and startup ecosystem [5].







A recent analysis suggests that the probability of doom given the existence of AI is lower than the probability of doom without AI [6]. However, there are still challenges to overcome in AI development. For instance, the ""Chihuahua or Muffin"" problem in computer vision remains unsolved by GPT-4V, which struggles to reason about the same images in a different layout and often miscounts the number of images. It also misrecognizes a Chihuahua as a muffin when asked about a specific image. These issues may stem from the model being trained on the original image and memorizing its labels [7].







Greg Brockman, another AI enthusiast, shares his diverse uses of ChatGPT, including coding, cooking, translating anime, suggesting chord modulations for a song, and conducting bio research [9].







In international news, Presidents Joe Biden and Xi Jinping are expected to announce a landmark agreement banning the use of AI in autonomous weaponry and the control and deployment of nuclear warheads. This agreement, to be announced at a bilateral meeting, is seen as a promising first step in regulating AI in autonomous weapons [10].

I've realized now that a Plus account is required in order to interact with custom GPTs, which means I'm not able to give my students access to it. Does anyone know of a workaround for this? If there's not a workaround, is anyone here aware of a similar AI program that can do what I'm looking for?"

It's me again. The last MSc thesis project has now concluded and I am advertising here again since it was such a success last time. The last student was awarded the best grade and will be nominated for the ETH Medal.

The project is about training foundation models, or large language models, from scratch (or kind of from scratch) to make them much more resilient to analog noise on our analog in-memory computing hardware. See the attached photo for more details.

Start date: 1st of March 2024  
Duration: 6 months  
Pay: None (prohibited from ETH)

What we offer: State-of-the-art analog in-memory computing hardware (just got the cover of Nature Electronics), you will work in a global team (different IBM Research labs are involved), and you will have access to GPUs reserved for this project (mostly V100s, but many of them).

You will learn how to pre-train LLMs, perform HW-aware training, and much more.

We are interested in students who want to do their MSc thesis (!) with us. Preferably from the CS department.

You must know what a transformer is, have taken courses related to Deep Learning and NLP, and have experience in Python, PyTorch, and Huggingface. It is a plus if you know how to do distributed training in a cluster.

If interested, send an e-mail to [jub@zurich.ibm.com](mailto:jub@zurich.ibm.com) (Julian Büchel) with Manuel Le Gallo ([anu@zurich.ibm.com](mailto:anu@zurich.ibm.com)) and Abu Sebastian ([ase@zurich.ibm.com](mailto:ase@zurich.ibm.com)) in CC.

Isn't the answer obviously that there is nothing really teachers can do about students using AI to cheat and not do the work, and that the political-corporate leaders of America have decided to let AI rip? Regulation could be imposed to limit the scope of AI, but then corporations don't want that (see the story about Silicon Valley tech bosses who met with the US Senate in a closed door meeting a couple months ago)."
17uludr,1,2023-11-13,Sadly a true story of my experience with Morgan Burtwistle aka AngryGinge,u/ItsMystyYT,OfficialAngryGinge,https://www.reddit.com/r/OfficialAngryGinge/comments/17uludr/sadly_a_true_story_of_my_experience_with_morgan/," 

I had a harrowing encounter with Morgan Burtwistle. He was a fiery-haired, freckle-faced boy with a malevolent glint in his green eyes. Little did I know that our paths would cross in a way that would leave indelible scars on my primary school years.

It all started innocently enough in  Primary School. I was a shy and reserved kid, Morgan Burtwistle, on the other hand, was the class troublemaker, always seeking the next opportunity to assert his dominance.

The first signs of trouble appeared during break. Morgan Burtwistle and his gang of friends would approach me, not just with words but with fists and kicks. Their laughter accompanied the physical blows, leaving me battered and bruised. It was not just about mockery anymore; it was a violent, daily assault on my well-being.

Day after day, the brutality escalated. I found myself cornered in secluded areas, subjected to relentless beatings that went beyond the boundaries of childhood mischief. My backpack was torn apart, and my lunch wasn't just smeared; it was forcefully thrown in my face. Their sadistic pleasure seemed to know no bounds.

I tried to endure the pain in silence, afraid that speaking up would only invite more aggression. My pleas for help fell on deaf ears, as teachers and other students turned a blind eye to the torment. The isolation became suffocating, and the fear of each approaching encounter with Morgan Burtwistle and his gang haunted my every step.

One day, pushed to the edge of desperation, I decided to confront Morgan Burtwistle. I stood up to him, challenging the torment that had become my daily existence. But instead of remorse, Morgan Burtwistle's eyes filled with a chilling satisfaction. The confrontation only fuelled the flames of his aggression.

As the violence continued, I found myself lost in a dark and lonely place. The bruises on my body mirrored the scars on my psyche. It was a constant struggle to maintain any semblance of normalcy, as the world around me became a nightmare I couldn't escape.

It wasn't until a concerned teacher finally intervened that the torment began to subside. The school administration took action, and Morgan Burtwistle faced consequences for his actions. While the physical scars slowly healed, the emotional wounds lingered, leaving me forever changed.

Looking back, that chapter in my primary school years was a journey through hell. It taught me the harsh realities of unchecked aggression and the importance of speaking out against violence. It also underscored the need for a community that stands against bullying, recognizing the profound and lasting impact it can have on a young and vulnerable soul.

I am a former elementary school teacher turned learning designer, who has been using ChatGPT in my work over the past 12 months. 

  
I do a bit of tutoring on the side, and needed some help brushing up on some of the content that I am helping my students with.   


I've created a custom GPT on ChatGPT that's a Science study tutor. I've given it a encouraging and positive tone, providing information that is easy and simple to understand. It can browse the internet (using BING), as well as generate images. You can upload documents to it and it can use it to generate study notes and quiz questions.   


This GPT is currently only open to those with this shared link, and any data or information that is used on this GPT is not shared to improve OpenAIs datamodels.

17upkuj,16,2023-11-13,Seeking practical advice and/or spiritual-philosophical advice re: potential ChatGPT papers,u/DerProfessor,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/17upkuj/seeking_practical_advice_andor/,"So, I thought I had a handle on the ChatGPT-thing:   I included in my syllabus for my upper-level class that I reserve the right to require an ""oral defense"" of any paper, and the grade for the oral defense is the one that stands.    (and I told them this was to catch AI-written or AI-assisted papers.) 

First paper was on an obscure topic, and I had a my usual (pre-AI) paper breakdown... 3 outstanding papers, a few As, a few Bs, and the rest Cs.  (I have high standards... the papers get better as the semester goes on.)  

I also added an in-class midterm. 

Here's the practical problem:   3 of my 4 top papers on the first and second papers got Cs on their in-class midterm essays.  And the new papers by them are *perfect*... literally, not one single mistake.  (perfect grammar, every comma correct, etc.)   Even though TurnItIn says ""0% AI"", it's just NOT feasible that 3 students would write phenomenally perfect essays, but write crappy in class mid-term essays. 

So, what I obviously ""should"" do is call them in for the promised/threatened oral defense.   But here's the rub:  the class has a *great* dynamic thus far (one of the best), and this implicit accusation will likely throw a wrench in that.  Also, I am *so* crushed.  I just don't. have. the. time. 

What would you do?  

Now for the spiritual- philosophical issue:   I am *so* demoralized by this.   I feel that my main claim to importance in students' education is that I work closely with them on their writing... and they get better!  They do!   And all of my massive/time-consuming effort is worth it, because being able to write well is such a boost to *any* career....

... and yet, does it matter now?  Now that everyone (including my students) will just have some dumb-ass AI write perfect memos for them for the rest of their lives, why bother with education?    What's the point??!  Our society will just be slaves to the internet, endlessly regurgitating... why should I even bother trying to train them to write or think critically, when it all will be done for them?    Is my very profession now so pointless?"

Introduction

A concept for a Three Houses remake that (hopefully) solves a number of the issues some had with the game, enfolds characters and worldbuilding from the DLC and Three Hopes effectively into the base game, and creates an improved yet similar gameplay experience in the ways people enjoyed.

Base Gameplay Functions

**Recruitment.** At this point only your allies are in the monastery. During Chapter 12 you can still request students of the Blue Lions house join you on missions to build support, and the same with staff members who aren't technically recruited. Post-timeskip, recruitment is done on the battlefield or via paralogues.

**The Calendar.** You are given a new mission after completing an old one. You *do not have to complete the mission before the end of a month*. However, you cannot take more than forty-five days to complete any given mission. In addition, traveling over the continent map to missions, paralogues or side battles takes up time. While traveling you can miss holiday meals, holiday services, and birthdays. Students will still learn while traveling. Traveling through a green region takes 1 day. You cannot travel through silver or colorless regions. Battling in a silver region takes two days, turning it green after.

**Group Tasks.** There are more than three group tasks now. How many students you can assign at a time starts at two and increases with professor level, to four at D, six at C, eight at B and ten at A. The group tasks are as follows: Training Yard Management (Sword), Camp Construction (Axe), Fishing (Lance), Hunting (Bow), Night Watch (Brawling), Studying (Reason), Chapel Service (Faith), Armor Maintenance (Armor), Recruitment (Authority), Care for Horses (Riding) and Sky Watch (Flying).

**Hidden Paralogues.** Post timeskip, most paralogues don't simply appear on the map - they have to be discovered while conquering territory. Hidden Paralogues (which accounts for the majority of post-timeskip paralogues) ONLY APPEAR if a territory bordering them is green.

**Side Battles.** Post timeskip, the side battles are not named and set. Instead they're randomly generated based on the location they're in and the part of the story they're set during.

**Ultimate Supports.** There's a level of support after A that many characters can reach with others, not just Byleth. Depending on the pair, these are either S supports (romantic proposals) or AA supports (platonic endings). Those trigger ordinarily, through increasing support levels, except for with Byleth. Byleth can choose to give anyone they've reached A support with the ring, triggering their ultimate support.

**Arcane Combat Arts.** Arcane Combat Arts are the result of Relics or Mastery Abilities; they rely on a certain spell's uses and consume one when activated, as opposed to weapon durability. Each is tied to a specific spell.

**Roster Revamp.** If you choose Silver Snow in the Holy Tomb, Edelgard warps away - then, your students begin to [discuss this new war.](https://imgur.com/a/BFs4G4a) Most of them leave - your new roster, assuming you recruited Shez and the Ashen Wolves, is as follows: Byleth, Rhea (Archbishop), Catherine (Swordmaster), Seteth (Wyvern Rider), Shamir (Sniper), Cyril (Wyvern Rider), Linhardt, Bernadetta, Manuela, Flayn, Yuri and Alois.

# Chapter 12: To War

Edelgard's forces are marching. Fortunately, it looks as though she and Hubert are the only former students present; the Blue Lion students have remained to fight alongside the Church, and while Rhea curses the Golden Deer for cowards they have every right to return home and stay out of this conflict. Meanwhile, the Church and its allies [prepare for a war.](https://imgur.com/a/i8kLeBw)

*Paralogue 15: A Cursed Relic.* Yuri and Shamir are discussing a Dagdan legend of plunder from Fodlan. Yuri seems particularly intrigued, then offhandedly mentions that he heard about something like that being brought in by Duke Gerth from Dagda, taken by Albinean pirates, and traded to Dominic. Baron Dominic is the green unit here, who is being attacked by monsters as Yuri seeks to reclaim the Fetters of Dromi.

*A: Defending the Monastery.* Exactly like Defending Garreg Mach, but the reinforcements are Dimitri for Jeritza and Felix for Hubert. Instead of being captured Rhea is injured and flees to the Kingdom just as in CF. Byleth falls just as in AM.

# Chapter 13: Hunting by Daybreak

Byleth awakes and goes to the monastery, only to see Edelgard there. She laments that only she and Dorothea, of the Black Eagles under her command, had time to come for the meeting, then is stunned to turn and see Byleth. They fight and Edelgard flees, only to meet Rhea, who came from her refuge in northeastern Faerghus on a feeling that something would happen. After a tearful reunion and Rhea asking if Byleth remembers anything, she laments that the monastery is fallen, claimed by bandits who soil its holy ground. Rhea asks if Byleth will help her reclaim this sacred place and restore it to glory, triggering [the fight.](https://imgur.com/a/R2TGq3p) Before the battle, however, you see (as you do before most battles in this route) students you can recruit [talking to one another.](https://imgur.com/a/Pf0TSpf) You can recruit Shez using [Byleth](https://imgur.com/a/O0kL6Yd) if they have at least a C support. You can recruit Dorothea using [Byleth](https://imgur.com/a/aIWCrYg) or [Manuela](https://imgur.com/a/Urzf2aa) assuming they have at least a C support with her.

After the battle, Rhea gathers the Church forces to her and announces that with Byleth returned, they have to push back against the Empire and its vassal states. Byleth adds, to Rhea's irritation, that they're going to try and keep their students safe. Rhea tells them that they've been given power for a reason and storms off. Catherine

# Chapter 14: An Empire Without A Goddess

The Western Kingdom and the Southern Alliance are under the sway of the Empire, and the students have become generals in their respective armies. The Church has reclaimed Garreg Mach, but it seems the Empire has heard - and they send forces to reclaim it: Randolph von Bergliez, Constance von Nuvelle and Thaddeus von Ochs. The Church has to stabilize [the area around Garreg Mach](https://imgur.com/a/2Wjv6Bd) before Randolph arrives to attack.

A: *Defending Garreg Mach.* Before the Imperial army arrives, there's a brief scene showing a student who can be [recruited](https://imgur.com/a/ONl3KWE) discussing with Randolph; in battle, Constance can be recruited by [Byleth](https://imgur.com/a/Louk7aj) or [Yuri](https://imgur.com/a/zaORpGp) if they have at least a C support with her. Randolph flees once defeated in this route, with Baron Ochs and (perhaps) Constance the only deaths.

# Chapter 15: The Valley of Torment

After the monastery is safe, Rhea invites Byleth with her to the Holy Tomb. She asks if Byleth recalls the Red Canyon, and Byleth responds that they fought Kostas there. Rhea begins to choke up and asks Byleth to leave her in the tomb, which they obediently do, having the option to pause a moment outside which allows them to hear her weeping. Meeting with the other Knights, Catherine recommends meeting in the Valley of Torment, near Charon territory. Manuela interjects to mention that Hanneman, who has been working in the Empire but has jumped at the chance to rejoin the Knights in the monastery and defend it, will try and meet them there as well, with news about the Empire's movements. Together, the Knights [plan their next move](https://imgur.com/a/8x34jN5).

A: *Clash at Ailell.* As the Knights mobilize to meet Professor Hanneman (who enters as a green unit but, if protected, becomes a blue unit immediately after the battle) word of their meeting reaches House Rowe. While the Rowe knights mobilize and [catch a thief](https://imgur.com/a/bYa4Okw) as well, the Knights enter the Valley only to walk right into an ambush. Hapi is recruitable by [Byleth](https://imgur.com/a/VSTBy7t) or [Yuri](https://imgur.com/a/C1h27DO) if they have at least a C support. Ashe is also recruitable by [Byleth](https://imgur.com/a/5Kp3Eix) or [Yuri](https://imgur.com/a/hNA22dj) if they have at least a C support. After the battle, Hanneman mentions there was quite a bit of a hubbub at the Great Bridge of Myrddin, which Catherine notes could be quite the opportunity for them to claim that land and march on Bergliez territory and later Enbarr directly.

# Chapter 16: The Rose-Colored River

Rumors reach the Knights of Alliance and Kingdom forces rallying behind Claude and Dimitri respectively. Byleth can suggest they help either or wait and let the three nations tire each other out; all students from the respective nation (or the Empire if neither is chosen) increase their support with Byleth. Rhea says instead they ought to take the Bridge of Myrddin and then use it to choke the Empire into submission. Seteth and Catherine agree that’s the best bet, and the Knights [march on the Alliance.](https://imgur.com/a/BCDmjF9)

A: *Hidden Paralogue 5 -* [*Heir to Albrecht.*](https://imgur.com/a/d38MrjT) Shamir gets asked about a mercenary contract for a single job and suggests they all go check it out. Apparently a pricey bounty is in a local inn, and that could of course help finance the war. When the group arrives, however, it’s not a stranger but Balthus, fighting off several mercenaries. Upon realizing it, any recruited Wolves immediately advise to help him instead. If none are alive and recruited, Balthus calls out to Byleth asking for help. After the paralogue is completed, Balthus catches up to the army and offers to help them out in repayment.

B: *Battle at the Great Bridge.* Before the Knights reach the bridge, its defenders [talk strategy.](https://imgur.com/a/7CWTuC4) After the Knights arrive, they sweep the Great Bridge, Ferdinand can be recruited by [Byleth,](https://imgur.com/a/zmka0jg) [Dorothea](https://imgur.com/a/r0rVGBB) or [Flayn,](https://imgur.com/a/AUk5MaR) assuming they have at least a B support with him (or B+, in Dorothea's case). Halfway through the battle, however, Ladislava enters as reinforcement - along with Lorenz, to his father's [consternation](https://imgur.com/a/HkaKPxM). Lorenz and Ladislava fall defending the Bridge as Erwin promptly retreats, forced to give it up to Church control.

# Chapter 17: Blood of the Eagle and Lion

The Empire, Kingdom and Alliance forces, all gathering to fight, meet at [Gronder Field.](https://imgur.com/a/DqbQNem) The Kingdom and the Alliance don’t fight one another, focusing on the Empire, but Dimitri seems quite aggressive and Shamir reports that she actually overheard Alliance forces discussing destroying the Knights of Seiros after they swept through the western Alliance. It seems all three factions may come out as enemies.

A: [*To War at Gronder.*](https://imgur.com/a/GWVQnts) While crossing the Great Bridge, the Knights receive reports that the Kingdom has managed to force a small force through the mountains, while the Alliance has crossed a sequence of smaller bridges in Ordelia. No one knows who can be trusted. Before the battle a scene plays, displaying Edelgard and Hubert's [own feelings](https://imgur.com/a/Wry4dRq) on this matter. Finally, the Knights deploy to fight forces of all three nations; they soon find the Alliance has soldiers out for their blood, and Claude opts to defend his people rather than let them fall to Rhea's blade. Dimitri will hear no reason, and of course the Empire wishes to stop all three from advancing. During the battle Randolph can be recruited by [Byleth](https://imgur.com/a/BEqz0Ph) or [Constance](https://imgur.com/a/O4qIPZZ) if they have a C support and you didn't kill Fleche; he and Fleche both disappear from the battlefield. Leopold's arrival dialogue as a reinforcement changes based on whether you [killed](https://imgur.com/a/PZyC7UN) or [spared](https://imgur.com/a/OHdWmkx) Randolph and Fleche. After the battle, a cutscene plays.  Edelgard, while retreating, spots Dimitri and calls out to him. Dimitri, in blind rage, runs at her, not stopping until he finds himself impaled on a lance that Hubert teleported in holding. Hubert makes the obvious joke about boar hunting before dropping the spear, grabbing Edelgard, and teleporting away, as Claude whistles, grabs his wyvern, and with a sigh remarks that there's little he can do to stop Rhea from personally claiming all of Fodlan now.

# Chapter 18: The Resurrection of Seiros

After success at Gronder, whispers have spread across the land. People say Seiros has been reborn. They say that she lives on in Rhea, the Archbishop, and that she'll destroy the Empire. Rhea welcomes these rumors and dons the Seiros garb henceforth when she goes to battle, unlocking the Saint class. As an additional mastery reward, Saint offers a class-exclusive Arcane Combat Art: *Immaculate Transformation,* which expends a use of Abraxas and turns Rhea into the Immaculate One for three turns or until she uses her staggering blow. As the Immaculate One, she can attack at one to three range with her Crest Stone, can fly, and takes up nine spaces. She does only have her normal amount of HP but heals each turn. The Knights decide that they need to secure the Kingdom and Alliance, both of which, paying heed to the rumors, now have factions that may be willing to assist the Knights with their war. Rhea decides to head to Fhirdiad and Derdriu; Yuri (or Catherine if he wasn't recruited) recommends taking the Silver Maiden instead, as it will allow them to hold the border with the Empire and is much closer to the monastery. Ferdinand if recruited, or Seteth if not, advises taking Derdriu first; the Kingdom is in shambles and will pose little threat. If Ferdinand is the one suggesting it, he adds that Hubert holds Arianrhod, and will be a formidable threat with such a mighty fortress; Monica is tasked with holding Derdiu, however, along with Count Varley, and clever as she is with organization she isn't a tactician capable of holding a mostly unfortified city. So the Knights [march on Derdriu.](https://imgur.com/a/V1AMTxm)

A: *Hidden Paralogue 2 - Forgotten Hero.* As the Knights of Seiros touch upon the infamous Enchanted Forest of Mircea, a howl echoes through the sky. A soft sound of weeping permeates the fog, and Linhardt recalls a legend of a lost Crest and a beast that guards it. Rhea goes very silent regarding this legend, and Seteth tells Flayn to stay silent just as she seems about to speak. Upon arrival, the Knights find Marianne (a green unit) in the midst of a forest of monsters, talking to Maurice. Maurice has unique dialogue against Rhea, and once the paralogue is completed Marianne joins your army.

B: [*Capturing Derdriu.*](https://imgur.com/a/wOYM2zu) As the Knights arrive in the city, the [Imperial army](https://imgur.com/a/ZPxRwZU) faces off against [Erwin](https://imgur.com/a/fw6HLEM) \- who, after the fall of Myrddin, has decided that the Church might well be a safer bet for the Alliance than the Empire. However, after their standstill ends, an Imperial scout calls out to Monica with news that sends Gregoire scurrying - and a cutscene triggers. Almyran ships, massive 24-gun warships, crest the horizon to the sound of [Citizens of the East.](https://youtu.be/oPrgYBIl-kM?si=cS9Yx2TbhJZh6c7K) Cannonballs fly over the city - and hit the walls, constructed long ago, that protect Derdriu from flooding. Water sweeps through the city streets. A lone man on wyvernback flies to the raised outer platform and throws a handaxe at an Imperial archer preparing to fire, and Nader steps off and announces himself as the camera pans over the approaching ships, with wyverns, soldiers, and giant hawks waiting on deck. ""My name is Nader the Undefeated, and this city is now under the protection of the Almyran Navy... under command of Prince Khalid the Immortal, heir to the throne."" At the announcement of their commander the camera focuses in on the furthest ship - where Claude, Failnaught in hand, watches carefully. Then the cutscene ends, and Claude [calls commands](https://imgur.com/a/AmuoBLj) to the soldiers. Claude has unique dialogue against [Byleth](https://imgur.com/a/hfMIXCX) and [Rhea](https://imgur.com/a/gOPugoQ) making his goals and intentions clear. Monica can be recruited by [Byleth](https://imgur.com/a/zmRSwdB) or [Dorothea](https://imgur.com/a/DDG3ITP) as long as they have a B support with her. After a long battle, the Knights drive out the Empire and protect Derdiu from Almyra... and now the time has come to turn their gaze to the far west, where Arianrhod awaits.

# Chapter 19: Maiden of Discord

With the Alliance now firmly under Church control and safe from Imperial incursions, the Knights must turn their gaze [westward.](https://imgur.com/a/IohVtBN) Fanning out through both Imperial and Faerghan Mach, they prepare to take the fortress city Arianrhod. Seteth [confronts Rhea](https://imgur.com/a/SmQMU4b) about what she intends to do once the war is over, with Catherine quick to come to her defense and Byleth asked to mediate. There isn't time to talk the aftermath too much, however; Rhea and surprisingly, Seteth have memories to share with Byleth, and there are other battles drawing attention as well.

A: *Hidden Paralogue 3 - Legend of the Lake.* As the Knights pass Duval territory, Linhardt mentions a curious myth about a saintly beast and a Sacred Relic. He tells Byleth, but advises them not to tell Rhea because he suspects she would be rather opposed to disturbing a sacred location for such a thing. Rhea *can't be deployed in this battle.* Byleth gathers those they think should join in such an excursion only to find a giant turtle apparently blocking the way.

B: *Hidden Paralogue 4 - Foreign Land and Skies.* The Empire is well and truly entrenched in Brigid; The Church intends to go and see if the island nation can't be persuaded to their side. Failing that, they may be forced to put an end to the pro-Imperial dynasty and cow the nation into staying neutral. The battle layout and opening and arrival dialogues change based on whether Byleth has a B support with Petra, and she is [resistant](https://imgur.com/a/dfXohkk) to the Empire at the beginning and when [arriving;](https://imgur.com/a/KaMFbNV) or whether Byleth does not, and Petra is openly on the side of the [Empire](https://imgur.com/a/aYs1CvM) and arrives as [reinforcement](https://imgur.com/a/olfbGeF). Either way, only Byleth can persuade her to join the Church, if they've reached C support.

C: [*Siege of the Silver Maiden.*](https://imgur.com/a/F6H2zGi) Arianrhod has long been a prize of the Kingdom, and the Empire won't let it go easily. However, some of the Kingdom's knights have organized a resistance! They attacked Arianrhod - and it seems Marquis Vestra, for inexorable reasons, attacked a faction within the fortress. If Ferdinand was recruited he quickly guesses what it must be - Hubert has moved to eradicate Those Who Slither in the Dark within Arianrhod. The Knights of Seiros, reinforcing the Kingdom, are drawing quite a bit of attention from both the Empire and the Agarthans as they arrive. Of course, Rhea and the Knights are able to expel Hubert, destroy Cornelia, and reclaim Arianrhod to defend the Kingdom in truth.

# Chapter 20: The Impregnable Fortress

After establishing safe boundaries for the Alliance and Kingdom, Rhea decides that it’s high time to [press southward](https://imgur.com/a/heV4yUb) to the heart of the enemy - and to destroy Edelgard once and for all. The first thing to do is seize Fort Merceus, in the heart of Bergliez, to advance from there into Hresvelg, where Edelgard rules.

A: *Taking Fort Merceus.* The battle is laid out exactly as it would be in Verdant Winds if Linhardt was recruited (in current 3H), with Caspar [standing guard](https://imgur.com/a/qIWLdoT) along with Jeritza. After Jeritza starts fleeing, however, [reinforcements](https://imgur.com/a/GQOh8PY) appear if Shez wasn't recruited. The commanders are defeated - though Caspar can be recruited by [Byleth,](https://imgur.com/a/BwVCdxJ) [Linhardt](https://imgur.com/a/qp2RC04) or [Petra](https://imgur.com/a/EG3sRLv) if they've reached B support - and the Javelins of Light fall as the Death Knight flees. Rhea has some [feelings](https://imgur.com/a/r375RcC) about them, of course, but tries to contain herself. Right now? They have an Empire to topple. And Enbarr is within sight.

# Chapter 21: The Chaos of War

The Knights of Seiros, having taken Fort Merceus, [march on Enbarr.](https://imgur.com/a/b785dyw) Edelgard's decision to keep civilians in the homes is met with quite a bit of shock, including, if recruited, from some of her own.

A: *Skirmish in the Streets.* Hubert and the Death Knight stand guard in the city streets; Jeritza dies when defeated, but if Byleth and Edelgard have reached C+ support Hubert retreats. When he does so, he tells Byleth that if they remember Arianrhod, they know that there is a chance they share a common foe. Afterward, there is nothing left save to make your way into the palace itself.

# Chapter 22: Conclusion of the Crossing Roads

A: *Clash at the Imperial Palace.*  This chapter plays out mostly the same as in Silver Snow. When Edelgard is defeated, if you reached C+ support with her, you have two dialogue boxes appear: “this ends here,” and “Wait. Hubert told us…” If the second is chosen, Byleth sheathes their sword and Edelgard, in shock and disbelief, does the same. She stands firm as Rhea, in equal shock and disbelief, demands to know what Byleth is doing, to which Byleth responds “she is my student too.” Hubert teleports in, chuckling that he knew his tidbit would entice Byleth to spare them. He and Edelgard explain about TWSITD, then Byleth has two options: “We will eliminate them. You are not welcome here,” or “then join us. We can end them.” If you tell them they're not welcome here, Hubert begins to speak up before Edelgard interrupts him and tells Byleth that they know she can't rest until Fodlan is liberated. Byleth grabs Rhea's wrist as she tenses and then orders Edelgard to leave, now, to which she. at Hubert's urging, reluctantly acquiesces.

If you choose to end Edelgard here, Hubert teleports in to fight Byleth and falls quickly to a spear from Seteth, then the current SS death scene plays. If you didn't reach C+ support with her, you receive no choice; you kill Edelgard in this chapter. After the battle, Rhea and (if Hubert died) a letter from Hubert or (if you spared Edelgard) Edelgard and Hubert fill in details regarding the [Agarthans and Relics.](https://imgur.com/a/4Le9qao) Then it becomes clear exactly where the Knights must next go.

# Chapter 23: The City Without Light

After Edelgard’s conquest ends, the Nabateans end up making one thing clear: the Agarthans, who were behind Nemesis, are ready to destroy everything once they set up their schemes. Everyone is in agreement: the Agarthans must be stopped. Even as Rhea and a certain recruit have [things still to discuss,](https://imgur.com/a/DEbZsTy) Byleth, the Knights of Seiros, and whoever they’ve ended up recruiting from the other nations of Fodlan begin marching their way [eastward,](https://imgur.com/a/y7y76iy) to fight Those Who Slither in the Dark.

A: *Hidden Paralogue 4 -* [*Into the Abyss (Shez).*](https://imgur.com/a/g4V2AS1) Shez approaches Byleth mid-travel. Byleth asks them what they’re doing and they respond, “oh, nothing. Just thinking how the time has finally come,” in Arval’s voice. Shez then grabs Byleth and teleports them to an empty void. Byleth prepares to fight Shez, who in turn raises their hands and says they don't know what happened. Epimenides appears and monologues about the fall of the Agarthans for a while and then tells Byleth and Shez that ""the Fell Star"" and ""his worthless vessel"" are trapped in Zahras forever. Byleth hears Sothis' voice, as if from afar, command them to kill Epimenides; once they do, for a moment, the form of a woman appears in a rift of light that deposits both of them at the very same place and time they started. Completing this paralogue unlocks the Asura class for Shez.

A: *Stand Strong at Shambhala.* This battle plays out much as in current Silver Snow; however, in the lead up, Rhea is more regretful, seemingly, of what happened to Byleth. Rhea seems eager to finally take her revenge, with Edelgard surprised to find how much they have in common. The battle plays out the same. When Thales calls down the javelins, Rhea stops them, and when she lands, Byleth and Edelgard if she's recruited thank her profusely. There’s a brief moment after the battle where Byleth, shown by a dying Myson, gets the chance to use the Asclepius Engine and, rather than demanding they try to use it to call back Sothis, Rhea allows Byleth to choose a single unit that died over the course of the playthrough; in addition to all the dead units, Jeralt is an option, and if you choose Jeralt then you gain support with both him and Rhea and there's a CG of Jeralt hugging Byleth after emerging from the machine. Then, however, the Nemesis awakening scene plays out as Rhea, Byleth and possibly Edelgard begin discussing how to proceed with Fodlan.

# Chapter 24: Following a Dream

After the Agarthans are defeated, everyone gathers at the monastery to discuss Fodlan’s future only to find that a man and an army of undead soldiers are [tearing northward.](https://imgur.com/a/DHN2CZd) Ferdinand if he was recruited, Jeralt if he was resurrected and it isn't Ferdinand, or otherwise Seteth - returns barely alive from trying to slow his advance. Rhea’s reaction to their return is grateful for Ferdinand, relieved for Jeralt, and extremely relieved for Seteth, who she reminds she attempted to insist not go in the first place. Everyone agrees: they have one more monster to stop before Fodlan’s future is safe.

A: *The King of Liberation.* At the Tailtean Plains, Rhea makes note that this is where she slew Nemesis all those years ago. Finally, Nemesis and the Ten Elites appear, along with a few Agarthan mages. Lamine does something which covers the battlefield in sludge, though the rivers stop it from spreading too far.Thus begins the final battle. Nemesis and his Elites fight against the Knights of Seiros and the Imperial army to the sound of God-Shattering Star. After you destroy the Ten Elites and defeat Nemesis himself, the final cutscene triggers.

If you recruited Edelgard, then Rhea rushes Nemesis. Nemesis trips her and raises the Sword of the Creator, declaring that he will finally do as the mages asked and put an end to her race of vile beasts. Rhea closes her eyes in mournful acceptance before Nemesis is knocked back by a swing of Aymr. Edelgard grabs Rhea’s hand, yanks her up, and tells her that surely the fabled Immaculate One couldn’t be so pathetic as to lose to a thief she’s already killed. Rhea shakes herself out of her shock, turns to Nemesis, and begins to ready herself before hesitating. She stands still and nods to Edelgard, who rushes forward and cleaves Nemesis in two. Nemesis’ upper half crawls toward Rhea, who calmly pins him to the ground with the Sword of Seiros, nods again to Edelgard respectfully, then sighs.

If you didn’t recruit Edelgard but recruited Yuri, Rhea rushes at Nemesis only to be stopped by a hand on her shoulder as Yuri tells her not to rush in. Nemesis mocks her, and Rhea grits her teeth but holds back. Nemesis finally charges, just in time for Yuri to jump in front of him, warp out of the way as he swings and cut his hamstrings, leading him to fall at Rhea’s feet. Rhea drives the Sword of Seiros through his heart, killing him, before turning away with a sigh.

If you didn’t recruit your lord or Yuri, but resurrected Jeralt, then the hand on her shoulder is Jeralt. He tells her he wants a go at this so-called King, and swordfights Nemesis for a bit. Rhea yells for him to leave Nemesis to her, and Jeralt counters that she’d have to make him. Rhea goes as though to shove him aside, then hesitates. She waits a moment, then as Nemesis lunges, casts Agnea's Arrow, incinerating him right in front of Jeralt, who turns to her and thanks her as she simply sighs.

If you didn’t meet the conditions for any of the above, then Rhea rushes Nemesis only to be knocked to the ground and disarmed. Byleth blocks Nemesis’ sword before it can strike her, and Rhea stands in shock. Byleth knocks Nemesis back, turns to Rhea, and then just as Byleth is about to step back, Rhea does so, turning with a sigh as Byleth dispatches Nemesis.

After this, the appropriate S support cutscene plays, then Byleth and their spouse are standing close together for the final scenes of Rhea and, if recruited, Edelgard discussing changes to be made in the future. Afterward, if your spouse is Seteth or Yuri, they mention they aren’t sure if this will be a good idea, then a cutscene begins regardless of S support status. Byleth lays the Sword of the Creator in a shallow grave, then lies beside it. Rhea kneels as they close their eyes, cuts open their chest, and pulls out Sothis’ Crest Stone. Rhea immediately heals Byleth with white magic, and their heart begins beating as their hair bleeds to blue. They sit up and look to Rhea, who crushes the Crest Stone, then drops the fragments in the grave. Byleth grabs a shovel, as do Rhea, Seteth, and, if recruited, Jeralt and your lord. Then there’s a scene from inside the grave of dirt covering it up, and a long sigh and Sothis whispering “finally.” Cut to outside the grave; Rhea is crying silently and whispers “goodbye, mother,” before hugging Byleth, then it goes to the ending text and end cards. The ending crawl changes slightly, based on whether you recruited Edelgard or not.

**Without Edelgard:** A rising flame was alight as the flow of time carved a new history for Fódlan. The final battle was over, and Nemesis was destroyed, along with the Agarthans. After five and a half years of war, a new age was set to begin. The Empire, Kingdom, and Alliance were forever changed, many of their leaders gone and the rest stepping up with the help of the Church. The borders were reinforced by divine decree, and many policies the Church had once held sacred were reworked entirely. The church's new leader became a champion of the people, working tirelessly to help them overcome the horrors of war and to carve a path towards reconstruction. Just as Saint Seiros tended to those who suffered in wars of the past, Fódlan's new rulers, with her guidance, embraced their role as guardians of the continent and its people.

I have to decide for an internship to do my Master Thesis at.  
About myself, I am a 22 years old second-year Computer Science Master in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence student at Delft University of Technology (TU Delft), and now is the time to decide for the Master Thesis (internship in my case).  
My interests are around Large Language Models - Gen AI (mainly) as well as Operations Research (and its combination with Machine Learning).    
In general, I love everything around Gen-AI, Deep Learning and OR, as well as having a keen interest for consulting, business, finance, etc.  
Additional info, I am currently already doing an internship at Amazon as a Business Intelligence Engineer, and I live in Delft.  
With that said, I am mostly looking for something good-looking on my CV and a good project, money is not such a big deal for me.  


 Currently, I have two confirmed offers:

1. Accenture (Amsterdam Office)  
   Project: Large Language Models and Gen-AI  
   Tomorrow, I am scheduled to meet with the new Lead of the Intelligence team, Accenture Song, to delve deeper into the project. The monthly salary for this internship is €600.  


2. Effixis (Brussels Office)  
   Project: Applying a POC of NLP models on a healthcare system, with a focus on fine-tuning using new methods of LLMs.  
   This internship, based partly remotely, is with the Swiss-Belgian startup Effixis. The salary is yet to be determined.  


Additionally, I am exploring two potential opportunities:

3. Swisscom (Rotterdam Office)  
   Project: LLM project (details to be clarified in an upcoming meeting)  
   This telecommunication project offers a monthly salary of €1000.  


4. TomTom (Amsterdam Office)  
   Project: Identification of human errors using ML models and processes  
   While not my initial focus, this project is intriguing, offering a monthly salary of €1200.   


5. McDermott (The Hague Office)  
   Project:  LLM Solutions: Chatbot & Report Writing   
   Offering a monthly salary of €1200.   


What should I do?

17v35xr,1,2023-11-14,Using AI to edit / check papers,u/johnbmason47,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/17v35xr/using_ai_to_edit_check_papers/,"Just had a guy get bounced from my grad school program for using an AI to write his entire thesis. Dumb, he should get a 0, plagiarism, I know. I agree, if somebody uses AI to generate an entire paper and say that they wrote it themselves, they should be given a 0 and reprimanded for plagiarism. 

However...

I'm not the greatest writer in the world when it comes to research type texts. I can do the research just fine, I can gather the data and assemble it in a way that makes sense, but it always sounds terrible. With my professor's permission, I submitted 3 versions of an assignment. One I wrote myself (ended with a 70, so not THAT bad), one that was completely AI generated (ended with a liberal 45/100), and one where I used an AI to fluff my writing. More or less, I created a hyper detailed outline of my paper, and punched in the prompt 'make this an essay of at least 1500 words, written at a graduate level.' That third paper ended at a 95 (it mis-cited a few sources and spelled things the American way, not the Canadian way (color vs. colour)). 

My question, and where the prof and I were kind of at a loss, is about that 3rd paper. I did all the hard work, all the research and all of the actual learning that was needed for the assignment. I got out of it everything I needed to, met all the expectations, and did just as much work as anybody else. The only difference is that I used the AI to fluff my writing. So, if a student submits a paper that they used AI to fluff, or correct and proofread, like I did, should it be the same consequences as somebody who simply plugs the prompt into ChatGPT and copy.pastes the answer? Or is what I did an ethical use?"

Baka pwede nyo ishare kung anong klaseng mga interview kadalasan for fresh grad? may technical ba? if technical interview, bawal ba mag search? kailangan gawin mo on the spot in your own knowledge? Medyo naiimposter syndrome ako. And kung natanggap sa trabaho, ano mostly papagawa sayo? papagawa ka na ba agad ng website na solo or magaassist kalang/may part na iaassign sayo? Any tips?"

17weeif,2,2023-11-15,The Future of Education: AI and Classroom Innovations?,u/thelivelyabbsey,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/17weeif/the_future_of_education_ai_and_classroom/,"In today's rapidly evolving educational landscape, the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into traditional classroom settings has sparked both enthusiasm and apprehension. Despite initial concerns about its implications, the transformative potential of AI in education is becoming increasingly evident.

A closer examination of AI-driven educational tools reveals a spectrum of possibilities that transcend the initial skepticism. For instance, exploring AI solutions tailored for self-learning in Advanced Placement (AP) exams showcased a remarkable shift in perspectives. These tools, when harnessed effectively, hold the key to unlocking a plethora of opportunities, particularly benefiting marginalized groups such as students with disabilities, those from economically disadvantaged backgrounds, homeschoolers, and individuals with special needs. 

One case study that can be conducted is the Ask Sia AI. This educational AI tool focuses on providing students key concepts, explanations, and students are able to share the chat history with anyone through a link like this one [https://app.asksia.ai/s/APUSH-Questions-1-3-refer-to-the-following-quotationWith-the-cotton-gin-a-single-operator-could-clean-as-much-cotton-in-a-few-hours-as-a-group-of-work-qraCvloO?utm\_source=Reddit&utm\_medium=all&utm\_campaign=reddit-11%2F15-05](https://app.asksia.ai/s/APUSH-Questions-1-3-refer-to-the-following-quotationWith-the-cotton-gin-a-single-operator-could-clean-as-much-cotton-in-a-few-hours-as-a-group-of-work-qraCvloO?utm_source=Reddit&utm_medium=all&utm_campaign=reddit-11%2F15-05)

One of the most notable advantages of these AI-powered tools lies in their ability to cater to individual learning styles and pacing. Unlike conventional teaching methods, these innovations empower students to progress at their own speed, ensuring they grasp concepts thoroughly—a crucial aspect, especially in preparing for AP exams and standardized tests.

Moreover, embracing AI in education promises a revolution in inclusivity, opening doors for personalized learning experiences tailored to the unique needs of diverse students. By leveraging technology, educators can create an environment where every student feels supported and equipped to excel, regardless of their background or circumstances.

Furthermore, the integration of AI doesn't seek to replace human instructors but rather complements their role. Educators can utilize these tools as aids to identify areas of struggle for individual students, providing targeted support and guidance where necessary. This collaborative approach between AI and teachers promises a more effective and engaging educational experience for learners.

As we navigate the future of education, the effective adoption of AI in classrooms holds immense promise. By harnessing these innovations responsibly and thoughtfully, educational institutions can usher in a new era of learning that is inclusive, adaptable, and personalized, preparing students for the challenges and opportunities of tomorrow's world.

What are your thoughts on how educational AI platforms such as ChatGPT and AskSia would change the classroom dynamics?"
17wkjym,1,2023-11-16,A Chatbot to Unlock Hidden Grants,u/TeamStill7417,u_TeamStill7417,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_TeamStill7417/comments/17wkjym/a_chatbot_to_unlock_hidden_grants/,"Hi,

I want to share an idea that recently came to my mind and I'm eager to hear your feedback. OpenAI has recently enabled the creation of specialized GPTs, tailored for specific purposes. These can be fed with specific information in forms like PDFs, websites, Word documents, and potentially databases.

In Germany, as in many other countries, there are numerous grants and subsidies that many people often know nothing about. For example, students can apply for Bafög to get financial support. This led me to quickly think about developing a ""BafögGPT"" - a chatbot holding all relevant information on this topic. However, this thought seemed too simplistic, possibly useful but kind of lame. What really intrigued me are the many lesser-known grants and subsidies that often go unused, be it due to lack of information, language barriers, or simply because the responsible advisors are not well-informed, among other reasons. A chatbot, constantly updated and capable of answering such questions, could be a significant help.

This idea need not be limited to students; it can apply to many areas involving state-related grants and subsidies. A concrete example: An acquaintance learned only after years that she was entitled to a certain subsidy, information that could have been beneficial to her much earlier.

This was actually approved upon inquiry. Such an information gap could be minimized. I believe we can agree that chatting with a chatbot, especially with ChatGPT, is quite impressive and simplifies many things, though not everything. Of course, it's not perfect, but I think it could generally be of great value. Currently, I am unaware of any site that could offer this in a pleasant, user-friendly, and especially multilingual manner, making it accessible to everyone.

Do you think such a specialized GPT could be helpful in overcoming the complexities of bureaucracy and grants, and in making them more accessible to people?"

Date: November 1

see the final question around 1hour 2 minutes in

**Cambridge Student:** ""To get to AGI, can we just keep min maxing language models, or is there another breakthrough that we haven't really found yet to get to AGI?""  


**Sam Altman:** ""We need another breakthrough. We can still push on large language models quite a lot, and  we will do that. We can take our current the hill that we're on and keep climbing it and the peak of that is still pretty far away. But, within reason, I don't think that doing that will (get us to) AGI. If (for example) super intelligence can't discover novel physics I don't think it's a superintelligence. And teaching it to clone the behavior of humans and human text - I don't think that's going to get there.  
And so there's this question which has been debated in the field for a long time: what do we have to do in addition to a language model to make a system that can go discover new physics?"""

Is there, or do you think there eventually will be, any way to share GPTs outside of a ChatGPT subscription? E.g., could it be done using the API with a customized interface?   


I know there was mention by OpenAI of maybe offering subscriptions to individual GPTs in the GPT store at some point. I think I could justify asking students to pay for a direct subscription to a GPT for a few dollars a month during a semester, especially because I don't have any other textbooks or materials. But I don't think I can justify asking them to drop $20/mo. for a semester on the full account. I always try to keep book/materials cost under $50 for the semester.

17wnhh6,80,2023-11-16,I need career advice: Should I drop out of college and just continue my Virtual Assistant Career where I'm currently earning 200k+?,u/YN_Espinosa,phcareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/phcareers/comments/17wnhh6/i_need_career_advice_should_i_drop_out_of_college/,"I (21M) am a Political Science student at a well-known university, currently in my 3rd year of college, and I have started to drastically lose passion over my course.

&#x200B;

In the beginning, pa lang my professors are already telling us students, and my family members na being a political science student is not practical. We will probably not get a job, more less high-paying one unless we have a backer or are planning to go to law school.

&#x200B;

I was in the same camp as those who wanted to pursue law, because back in high school I really liked debating, I understood the law quite easily and was able to catch on quite quickly with its concepts. Until now, naman, during my classes in Political Science, since I'm swamped, I rarely go in prepared, and I still can answer recitations properly and achieve high marks, be part of the dean's list, and all that good stuff, oh and thanks to ChatGPT I can answer all my course work! (Unethical, I know, but it's what's keeping me to be able to juggle work and school). The only thing I can't ChatGPT are the recitations so those are mostly the only things na I prepare for in class. In short, I find my course quite easy since I have the tools to make it so, until today na sobrang dami na bigla ng readings (5 books at least per subject), and it's also research season. I still have a trick up my sleeves pero sobrang dami na talaga to the point na while working I am also studying.

&#x200B;

Now, on to the career part. 200k salary pero 21 lang? Believe it or not, it's true! Allow me to give you the full timeline para naman it would sound believable:

&#x200B;

I started working in the call center industry back in July 2021, which was as soon as I graduated from Senior High School. At this time was when I also enrolled in college thinking na ""online class naman, kaya kong pagsabayin,"" which in some way was true because kinaya ko kahit papaano ng 6 months as a full-time student and full-time call center agent. My mom tried to stop me from working kasi well-off naman kami, and it doesn't really make sense to work and study at the same time. Pero sabi ko sakanya na I want to have my own money para sa mga luho ko sa buhay at para na rin may kahati sila ng dad ko sa pagpapaaral sakin (even though it wasn't necessary). My mom told me na once I started earning my own money, baka ayaw ko ng tumigil at magpalamon na ako sa work, I told her na that won't happen, na I really wanted to finish my degree (foreshadowing).

&#x200B;

After 6 months of working as a call center agent na non-stop ang calls and while studying full-time rin, my health started deteriorating, and I was so burned out that I resigned after 6 months after saving enough money to buy my own laptop.

&#x200B;

After I drained the rest of my savings, I felt na I hindi ako kuntento na umaasa ulit ako sa magulang ko. I wanted to start earning again, and that's when discovered the Virtual Assistant world! At first, I thought this was some sort of scam, that what people are claiming is impossible in terms of their work set-up and salary, but after some due diligence, I decided to give it a go sa UpWork nung una with a social media management niche, but after spending 1k pesos in connects, I felt like I wasn't getting anywhere with my proposals and so after 1 month nag stop ulit ako sa paghahanap. By March of 2022, I discovered OnlineJobsPH na less competition since it's only Filipino VAs you're up against.

&#x200B;

After I drained the rest of my savings, I felt na I hindi ako kuntento na umaasa ulit ako sa magulang ko. I wanted to start earning again, and that's when discovered the Virtual Assistant world! At first, I thought this was some sort of scam, that what people are claiming is impossible in terms of their work set-up and salary, but after some due diligence, I decided to give it a go sa UpWork nung una with a social media management niche, but after spending 1k pesos in connects, I felt like I wasn't getting anywhere with my proposals and so after 1-month nag stop ulit ako sa paghahanap.

&#x200B;

I hyperinflated my experience a bit para makasabay kahit papaano sa competition. I made sure na tailor fit ang mga cover letters na ipinapadala ko sa mga employers. I spent more than 8 hours per day para lang ma max out ko yung 10 applications per day na limit dati, sometimes ni hindi ko man nga nauubos. I got some replies and interviews here and there pero wala pa rin naghire sakin. Still, after 1 month of sending out applications non-stop like it's a full-time job, I got an interview invite from a client in OLJPH na isang start-up company looking for a full-time social media manager to kickstart their Facebook and Instagram pages, I did not apply to this company. Hence, it really came as a surprise. Akala ko pa nga scam sya, but I gave it a go.  
Coincidentally, another person replied to one of my applications, this time, it's someone looking for a part-time Social Media Manager. The full-time client (Client A) offered 28k, and the part-time on the other hand offered 22k (Client B). I took the risk and accepted both offers and nakaka amaze nga na magkasunod na araw pa nila ako hinire sa OLJPH!  
Si client A, everything was going smoothly. I am able to post sa accounts nila 5x a week with good feedback, we meet daily to discuss progress and brainstorm ideas. However, nagsusuffer yung sa client B, hindi ko lagi na post on time yung mga content sa accounts nya kahit pa na pwede namang i pre-schedule. Slowly naman I improved over kay client B, and since part-time lang din sya, we only talked weekly to discuss progress.  
2 months into this endeavor, Client A gave me a big project that took a week to complete. It was a research + infographics work that by the time I was done, he was so impressed na since the company is rapidly growing daw, he wanted to move me from being a social media manager into being the operations manager of the company. Yes, ako rin hindi makapaniwala. I did my job above and beyond, and I was rewarded. I told client A that I was not really sure if I could perform as good as I was being a social media manager into being an operations manager, but he said we'll give it a try and he will provide some form of training. So, I signed the new contract and gave it a go. Nag jump yung salary ko sa kanila to 42k. So, by now, I'm earning 64k, more than I could ever imagine making as a VA. Note that I won't disclose Client A's industry because it's very lucrative and sobrang baba ng competition, and I don't want it to suddenly become saturated once na discover. (Selfish, I know. It's every man for himself. Baka magulat na lang ako eh $1/hour offer na lang ang field kapag na discover.)  
Anyway, since I practically have no clue about what the company is entirely about aside from what I needed to learn for my previous social media manager role, I really had a hard time adjusting. I had to learn so many tools in a short time. I also had to manage a team of 5 na more experienced than me. I don't even know kung bakit hindi na lang isa sakanila yung ginawang OM instead na ako, I felt like an imposter.  
1 and a half months later, after non-stop learning from client A and the team I managed, I learned the business all throughout. There are still some hiccups pero nalagpasan naman.  
6 months as an OM, client A suddenly had multiple directions he wanted to take with his career and started multiple businesses simultaneously, and he kept flinging me in multiple directions. Sometimes, I'm an OM, sometimes, I'm an HR, and at times, I'm a social media manager. I practically worked 10 hours per day with no overtime pay nor further increase in my salary. Client A always promised that something good is on the horizon, lol. However, I never got the courage na magreklamo since if I let client A go, I'm not sure if mahahanapan ko pa sya ng kapalit.  
Nailaban ko naman si Client A. I learned his main business like the back of my hand. I learned how to handle a team, manage our clients, create processes, and so on.  
However, by the 10th-month mark, client A started to shift his focus to the other businesses he has and started not to include me in the plans, we only talked once a week instead of daily. I felt like something was wrong. There was that sudden feeling that I no longer had any job security. And so, I looked for a new client in OLJPH. This time, I'm no longer applying as a social media manager, but I tailored my profile as an OM in the industry of client A. After doing so, hindi ako makapaniwala na andaming nag reach out na employer. I had 10 job interviews, of which 3 lang ang inapplyan ko. The rest were direct reachouts from clients in OLJPH.  
I got offers ranging from $5 to $10 per hour. Some, especially yung yung mga on the lower end of the scale ay trip mag micromanage. They want me to use time trackers that take screenshots of my screen every few minutes. I never proceeded with those type of clients, ayaw ko na ulit ma experience! Lol.  
However, I took 2 offers; Client C offered $10/hour for an OM position. Client D offered $10/hour for an associate position. And just like that, I was earning 200k per month (Note that Client B is still present).  
Timezone wise, yung isa EST, then the other is PST at 8 hours each. So nagmumukhang 16 hours yung work ko daily, but in reality very relaxed talaga itong field ko. Although, I have to admit sobrang hirap noong una dahil sabay ang onboarding, but after that everything went smoothly na. There are days na nakakasingit ako ng 8 hours of sleep in my shifts, while also being able to complete my work on time and of high quality.  
Now, with that very unnecessary long story, all my point was I had a taste of what would happen if ever na i-let go ako ng current clients ko from this very lucrative field that I'm working on... I won't have a hard time finding another one. Baka sila pa nga ang lumapit sa akin.  
So why should I even continue studying kung burden na lang sya sa career progress ko? Kung tutuusin I can get another client siguro if wala lang akong studies na inaalala.  
The only thing stopping me is the prospect of graduating and getting a college diploma. Just in case na kailanganin ko sya if this entire VA industry falls apart (I doubt it).  
So, if my current career continues, I won't even need that degree. And ang gusto ko talagang maging fallback if ever na matapos ang VA career ko is having my own business and investments (a work in progress).  
I would appreciate some advice. A brutal one if needed. Would I be making a fatal mistake if I dropped out of university?  
My other option is to continue what I'm doing in terms of studies and work. I can just wait to fail my classes, and if that happens edi I'm done with studying altogether. Leaving my work is not an option, and I already built a career, and hindi ako pwedeng mapag-iwanan ng advancements sa field just because I chose to study.  
So yeah, this post is very long and probably confusing. Just be brutally honest. I know the final decision will still be mine, but what would you do in this situation? Will you continue studying and pursuing remote work simultaneously, or will you drop out instead? Or do you have a different strategy in mind?"

In today’s digital age, technology has made significant strides in various aspects of our lives. One area where technology has had a substantial impact is education. With the advent of artificial intelligence, students can now access advanced tools to help them in their academic attempts. ChatGPT has gained popularity among students and educators for its ability to assist in writing essays. Here, we will explore how to use ChatGPT to write an essay, providing five essential tips, discussing the time it takes to complete an essay using this tool, and offering guidance on avoiding plagiarism.

## Top 5 Tips on How to Use AI to Write a Paper

So, how to use AI to write a paper? Writing an essay can be challenging, and many students seek assistance from ChatGPT to simplify the process. Yet, using this tool effectively is crucial to get the best results. Here are five tips on how to use ChatGPT to write an essay:

**1. Clearly define your topic**  
Before using ChatGPT, you should have a well-defined topic for your essay. The more specific your topic is, the easier it is for the AI to generate relevant content. For example, if your essay is about *“The impact of climate change on coastal ecosystems,”* it’s essential to specify the aspects you want to cover, such as *“effects on marine biodiversity”* or *“rising sea levels.”*

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/39edoe20qq0c1.png?width=551&format=png&auto=webp&s=90ae24aa9dd4259d3b85c5c0737775e132739917

**2. Use descriptive prompts**  
When interacting with ChatGPT, use descriptive prompts that outline your requirements clearly. Instead of asking a vague question like, *“Write about climate change effects,”* you should provide more guidance, such as, *“Can you provide an overview of the impact of rising temperatures on polar bear populations in the Arctic due to climate change?”* This way, the AI understands your expectations better.

**3. Review and refine the output**  
After ChatGPT generates content, reviewing and refining the text is crucial. The AI can sometimes provide information that is not entirely accurate or may require additional context. Make sure to fact-check the information and ensure it aligns with your essay’s requirements.

**4. Maintain a consistent tone and style**  
To make the essay cohesive, maintain a consistent tone and style throughout the paper. ChatGPT can adapt to various writing styles, but you must guide it in the right direction. For instance, if your essay is academic, specify that you want a formal and academic tone.

**5. Cite your sources**  
Even though ChatGPT can generate content, it’s essential to remember that your essay needs to be well-referenced and backed by credible sources. Use the AI-generated content as a starting point, and then conduct additional research to support your claims. Always cite the sources you use in your essay.

## How Long Does It Take to Write an Essay Using ChatGPT?

So, how long does it take to write an essay using ChatGPT? The time it takes to write an essay using ChatGPT can vary considerably, influenced by factors determining the overall writing process. These elements include the topic’s complexity, the essay’s length, the quality of the AI-generated content, and the time invested in reviewing and editing the text. Still, ChatGPT can expedite the writing process significantly.

For instance, let’s consider a typical 1,000-word essay as a benchmark. Using ChatGPT, you can expect to cut the initial drafting process down to a few hours. The AI’s ability to swiftly generate content is a tremendous asset in getting your essay’s basic structure and content in place. Yet, this is only the starting point of the essay-writing process.

Following the content generation, you’ll need to allocate additional time for reviewing and editing the material. The duration required for this phase can take a few more hours, ensuring that the generated content aligns with the essay’s objectives, is free from grammatical errors, and maintains a coherent flow. This is a critical step as it transforms the raw AI-generated content into a polished and coherent essay.

>The complete time frame to produce a well-structured essay using ChatGPT typically **falls between 3 and 5 hours**.

This span encompasses the initial drafting, content generation, review, editing, and researching phase to enhance the essay’s quality. This approach represents a notable departure from the traditional essay writing process, which could extend over several days or even weeks.

Recognizing that ChatGPT’s assistance should not be viewed as a shortcut to hasty essay creation is critical. Instead, allocate the extra time for conducting thorough research and ensuring the highest standards of quality and accuracy in your essay. This balance between AI support and human expertise is the key to unlocking the full potential of ChatGPT as a powerful tool for essay writing.

## Tips on How to Use ChatGPT to Write an Essay Without Plagiarizing

Do you know how to use ChatGPT to write an essay without plagiarizing? One of the concerns when using ChatGPT is the potential for unintentional plagiarism. To ensure your essay is free from plagiarism and retains its authenticity, follow these tips:

* **Paraphrase and reinterpret**

Instead of copying ChatGPT’s content, rephrase the information provided in your own words. This will prevent plagiarism and help you understand the material better.

* **Attribute AI-generated content**

When you use AI-generated content in your essay, attribute it to the AI source. Mention that the information was generated using ChatGPT. This way, you acknowledge the assistance received and maintain transparency.

* **Cross-check for originality**

Before finalizing your essay, use plagiarism detection tools like [Turnitin](https://www.turnitin.com/) or [Copyscape](https://www.copyscape.com/) to check for unintentional matches with existing content. This will help you identify and rectify any potential plagiarism issues.

* **Add your unique insights**

To make the essay your own, add your unique insights, perspectives, and analysis to the AI-generated content. This will showcase your critical thinking and creativity.

* **Follow citation guidelines**

If you include information from external sources, follow the appropriate citation guidelines (such as APA, MLA, or Chicago) to attribute the sources correctly. Doing so ensures you give proper credit to the original authors.

* **Regularly save drafts and versions**

Throughout the essay-writing process using ChatGPT, make it a practice to save multiple drafts and versions of your work. This not only helps safeguard your progress but also creates a record of the evolution of your essay. If you encounter plagiarism concerns, having a history of your work can assist in demonstrating your genuine efforts to create an original piece.

### How to tell if AI wrote an essay?

With the advancements in AI, it has become challenging to distinguish between human-written and AI-generated content. Yet, there are a few telltale signs that can help you know how to tell if an essay is AI-generated:

* **Consistency and clarity.** AI-generated essays are consistent and clear in their presentation. There may be fewer grammatical errors and a more polished writing style. While individuals can also produce high-quality work, consistent excellence might raise suspicion.
* **Lack of personal experience.** AI lacks personal experiences and emotions. If an essay lacks anecdotes or references to personal experiences, it may be a clue that AI generated the content.
* **Limited creativity.** AI can provide factual information but often lacks humans’ creativity and imaginative storytelling abilities. The essay might be AI-generated without a creative narrative or artistic touch.
* **Excessive technical jargon.** If the essay is filled with excessive technical jargon and lacks human-friendly explanations, it could be a sign that AI wrote it, especially in a field where technical language is commonly used.
* **Unusual references.** Check for unusual or obscure references, quotes, or citations that are not typical of human-written essays. AI may pull from a wide range of sources, including lesser-known ones.

### How does AI detection work for essays?

To detect whether an essay is AI-generated or written by a human, several methods and tools are employed:

1. **Writing style analysis.** AI detection systems can analyze an essay’s writing style and patterns. AI-generated content may exhibit a more consistent and polished writing style, while human writing might have natural variations.
2. **Plagiarism detection**. Plagiarism detection tools compare the essay against existing content to identify any similarities. While these tools can detect direct plagiarism, they may not always identify AI-generated content that has been paraphrased.
3. **Cross-reference with known AI sources.** Some AI detection systems maintain databases of known AI-generated content. They cross-reference essays with this database to identify potential matches.
4. **Content analysis.** AI detection tools can analyze the content of the essay, looking for signs of unusual or inconsistent language use, citation patterns, or lack of personal experiences.
5. **User behavior analysis.** User behavior can also be a factor in some cases. If an essay was produced in an unusually short time or there are frequent interactions with AI in the editing process, it might raise suspicion.
6. **Visual inspection.** AI-generated essays might have subtle formatting or style differences identifiable through visual inspection, such as variations in font or spacing.
7. **Metadata examination.** Metadata refers to information embedded in the digital file, including the document’s creation date, author, and revision history. Metadata analysis can provide insights into the document’s origin and editing history, which may indicate AI assistance.
8. **Complex syntax and semantic analysis.** Advanced AI detection systems delve into the essay’s sentence structures and semantics, searching for patterns that differ from typical human writing. Unusual phrasing, overly complex sentences, or a mechanical tone can suggest AI involvement.
9. **Comparative analysis**. AI detection often involves comparing the analyzed essay with a reference set of human-written and AI-generated essays. By establishing a benchmark for comparison, detection systems can identify deviations from expected patterns.
10. **Feedback from AI platforms.** Some AI platforms have built-in feedback mechanisms that allow users to rate or comment on the quality of AI-generated content. Analyzing user feedback can provide additional insights into the content’s origin.

## Concluding Remarks

Integrating artificial intelligence tools like ChatGPT has made essay writing more accessible and efficient for students. Yet, it’s essential to use this technology responsibly and ethically.

We live in an age where tenured professors can get away with trying to dump information in your skull with no consideration for whether or not their students understand or apply their knowledge. 

Then, when I get home (despite having pretty okay reading comprehension), I'm exhausted after 4-6+ hours of lectures and are forced to sift through formally written textbooks that assume a baseline understanding of life's most complex topics - simply put, it makes me homicidal. 

ChatGPT can be a 24/7 tutor that never gets annoyed by asking follow up question after follow up question. What's more, I'm encouraged to cross-reference and fact-check, which further builds my learning. If used wisely, it's studying gold. 

Though, I have to admit, I'm a bit cautious. Have you guys noticed any flaws with this approach? "
17wy3lj,88,2023-11-16,Tips on teaching programming to someone who doesn't get it (should I give up?),u/jdrc8,ExperiencedDevs,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/17wy3lj/tips_on_teaching_programming_to_someone_who/,"Hi! I'm trying to help a really close friend of mine save her almost dead software engineering career. 

# Background and context (you can skip if you don't care):

We're not in the US. I don't know about other countries, but here, you can cheat your whole way to a Bachelors Degree in CS and get it without knowing how to write ""Hello World"" in any language. This is exactly what she and 70% of students in our generation did. She knows that was terrible, but there's no changing the past.

She graduated 2 years ago and spent a year on a couple internships that (barely) got her a job, which she quit shortly after from due to a depression from ending a 6 year long relationship. Now she has spent a whole year looking for a job but no one will take her in, probably because of how suspicious her resume is and how bad her programming skills are...

# The problem:

I've talked to people in a small business I used to work in, and they are willing to take her as an intern if I can teach her enough about the tech stack they're using, and man... it's going so bad...

*  She understands the fundamentals like conditionals, ""for"" loops, methods, etc. Also was able to understand ""less fundamental"" concepts like classes, properties, etc. but **when I ask her to solve a problem in which you have to use more than one of those together, she can't figure it out**. A lot of the times, she will not solve a problem unless I hand-hold her 90% of the way there, then she'll solve the remaining 10% alone, but still struggle way too much with it.
* **Her mind will go completely blank when facing almost any new programming problem.** This is something I've talked to her about and she was able to confirm it. She will look like she's thinking about it, but in reality there's not much going on and she'll give up saying something like ""I just don't get it"" or ""I have no idea"" after staring at the screen for 20 minutes. She will not come up with any ideas or questions during that time.
* I've taught her some tips on how to look for information efficiently and how to use ChatGPT as a learning tool, but **whenever she's stuck, she has no idea what to look for and what to ask**. The only kind of searching she's able to do alone is basically copy-pasting the whole problem I just gave her.
* I don't think it's a motivation problem (unless you guys see something I dont). She understands this might be her last opportunity to save her career. I'm not forcing her to learn this. She's spending a lot of time and money on this (she lives far) so **I trust she understands her situation**.

We've been doing this for 1 month, which might not be too much, but they're not gonna wait forever. If she can't learn enough in 1 month for this internship, how can she ever learn enough for a random technical interview in a random company? Even if she did pass and get a job, how could she learn enough of the actual job fast enough to not get fired? At this point, I'm thinking of just telling her software engineering is not for her, but I'm afraid I could be wrong and be destroying the career of someone who could actually be making a living out of it eventually.

...

**You guys got any tips, stories or advice for me?**"
17wy51e,11,2023-11-16,"Paper ""Compositional Abilities Emerge Multiplicatively: Exploring Diffusion Models on a Synthetic Task"" demonstrates how a diffusion model that the researchers trained eventually learned to generate novel combinations of concepts that were present in images in the training dataset",u/Wiskkey,aiwars,https://www.reddit.com/r/aiwars/comments/17wy51e/paper_compositional_abilities_emerge/,"[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09336).

>  
>The paper is trying to understand how AI models like DALL-E learn to combine simple concepts they are trained on to make more complex and new images. For example, if the model is trained on images of red circles, blue triangles, and green squares separately, can it take what it learned about each shape and color and combine them to generate a new image like a blue circle that it never saw before?  
>  
>To study this, the researchers created a very simple synthetic dataset of geometric shapes with different colors and sizes. They trained an AI model on only some combinations of shape, color and size (e.g. big red circle, small blue triangle). Then they tested if the model could generate new combinations it wasn't trained on (e.g. small red triangle).   
>  
>They found:  
>  
>\- The model learned to make new combinations in an order based on how different the new combination was from what it was trained on. So it could make something slightly new before very new.  
>  
>\- When some concepts like a color were rare in the training data, the model took longer to learn to generate that color, even for simple new combinations. This shows the model needs a certain amount of examples to learn a concept.  
>  
>\- The model's ability to combine concepts emerged suddenly, like a lightbulb switching on. This is because it had to learn all the individual concepts first, and then combining them had a multiplying effect on performance.  
>  
>So in summary, the experiments on the simple dataset showed that:  
>  
>\- AI models learn concepts separately first, then learn to combine them later to make new things.    
>  
>\- How easily they can combine concepts depends on how different the new combination is from the training data.  
>  
>\- They need enough examples of each concept to learn it properly before combining.  
>  
>\- Their ability to make new combinations emerges suddenly once all the pieces are in place.  
>  
>The researchers hope these insights on this simple system can help better understand and improve how more complex AI models like DALL-E learn to creatively combine concepts to make new things.

For the paper's main experiment, the researchers labelled synthetic images in the training dataset with 3 digits 0 or 1 using the following scheme: First digit is shape: 0=circle, 1=triangle. Second digit is color: 0=red, 1=blue. Third digit is size: 0=large, 1=small.

The training dataset for the main experiment contained synthetic images with these labels: 000 (i.e. circle, red, large), 001 (circle, red, small), 010 (circle, blue, large), and 100 (triangle, red, large). The specific sizes and colors for images in the training dataset with a given label varied in exact color and size - see section A.1 for details.

Although not in the training dataset, the neural network eventually learned to successfully generate images for these labels with high accuracy: 011 (i.e. circle, blue, small), 101 (triangle, red, small), 110 (triangle, blue, large), and 111 (triangle, blue, small). See Figure 5b for details.

Some quotes from the paper:

>Before proceeding, we emphasize the trade-offs and limitations of our model-experimental systems approach. Just as neural mechanisms identified in model animals cannot be directly applied to human medical applications, our observations should not be considered definitive conclusions that can be directly transferred to modern large generative models. Instead, our study aims to establish conceptual frameworks, identify data-centric control variables, and formulate mechanistic hypotheses, paving the way for further theoretical and empirical explorations of larger models.

&#x200B;

>We hypothesize the nonlinear increase in capability observed in large neural networks as size and computational power scale up is partially driven by the data’s compositionality.  Models must learn all required concepts, but compositional generalization is hindered by the multiplicative, not additive, impact of learning progress on each concept. This results in a rather sudden emergence of capabilities to produce or reason about out-of-distribution data."

I wouldn't be comfortable using it to totally replace me, or maybe in academic contexts. But for my creative course, it's really great.   
scribes my lectures, summarizes them, and then lets you talk with it afterward ([Spacebar](https://spacebar.fm/)) LikeChatGPT but based on the content of a lecture. Students are loving it! They pretty much get to 'talk with me' but I don't have to be there. Kinds scary, but super helpful if you're overwhelmed with work/life balance.   


I'm just teaching a creative course so it's fine for that. I don't know about academics or anything, but thought I would share in case any of you have the same issue!

- ChatGPT, an AI chatbot, has the potential to transform education by providing personalized tutoring and making information more accessible.

- However, there are risks and concerns about the accuracy and reliability of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT.

- Educators should explore the benefits of LLMs and teach students about their strengths and weaknesses.

- Institutions like Arizona State University are using LLMs in education-specific ways, such as retrieving information from specific data sets.

- It is important to address biases and discrimination in LLMs and use them in a way that improves learning outcomes.

>The paper is about generating new images using AI systems that have only been trained on images from one specific category.

>  
>The main ideas:  
>  
>AI systems for generating images (like GANs and diffusion models) work by mapping points from a ""latent space"" to images. The latent space is like a high-dimensional grid where each point maps to a unique image.  
>  
>These AI systems are typically trained on images from one category (like dogs). But the researchers found that even when trained on just dogs, the system learns a rich enough latent space that it can map new points to completely new types of images like churches.  
>  
>To generate new churches, they take real church photos, convert them to latent points using the pre-trained dog model, and analyze the patterns. This lets them sample new latent points that are likely to map to churches when fed through the dog model.  
>  
>They use concepts from math and geometry to understand how latent points for churches form a cluster distinguishable from dogs. This helps generate new church points that stay separate from the dog cluster.  
>  
>By cleverly analyzing the latent space of a pre-trained single-category AI system, they generate completely new types of images without needing to train on those additional categories.  
>  
>In summary, the researchers find that even an AI system trained on a single category contains enough knowledge in its latent space to generate totally new types of images, by studying the latent geometry. This is done without any additional training.

Some quotes from the paper:

>This work is built upon our key observation: as the state-of-the-art generative models, a pre-trained DDPM on single-domain images (e.g., dog faces) already has sufficient representation ability to reconstruct arbitrary unseen images (e.g., human faces and churches) from the OOD \[i.e. out-of-distribution\] latent encodings, as shown in Fig. 1.  
>  
>\[...\]  
>  
>The above observation motivates re-thinking the representation and generalization ability of diffusion models, and to leverage this unique property to synthesize unseen images via pre-trained and frozen DDPMs in this work.  
>  
>\[...\]  
>  
>Why UnseenDiffusion works? At the end of this paper, we seek to revisit and explore the underlying logic to explain the reasons for which our UnseenDiffusion works. From the recent BoundaryDiffusion work, the authors show that the semantic editing of images can be effectively achieved via one-step modification on the latent spaces after the semantic boundaries are localized, which reveals an interesting fact that the latent spaces of diffusion models preserve the semantic characteristics of raw data space from a geometric point of view. Specifically, if the images in the raw data space exhibit certain manifolds and distributions that can be semantically separated, it is very likely that those characteristics are preserved in the latent spaces of trained diffusion models, regardless of the training domains."

17x7yz3,1,2023-11-17,"Help required, not sure what to do (extremely sorry for such a long read), how to break back into tech?",u/Zeus_Art,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/17x7yz3/help_required_not_sure_what_to_do_extremely_sorry/,"Moved to canada in 2021 thinking I will have better development opportunities and carrier.
I did bachelor's in CSE in India passed with great CGPA was exceptionally good at coding in my college, did great projects and all that barely few could do or think at that time. As a final year project developed a great full stack android app with Machine learning and all, and paid one guy just so we (me and my group member) can get certification that we developed this project with a company and they can help us out in project. Well they didn't helped but gave a legit certificate that we worked adding 1 year of experience on my resume, thought just on paper.
After that covid hit and things got delayed by 6 months and finally moved to canada, did masters in Applied computing from windsor. There I realised I wasn't a great programmer nor my projects were great, its just the people in my college were barely average, plus I lacked leetcode skills since I had no idea that it was needed and all, yes I didn't use much google and youtube during my bachelor, I wasnt aware nor anyone around me was aware.
My college professors were barely average as well. But here in masters the scenario was totally different, everyone around me was seriously into coding and leetcode and professors were great. Ofc there were once again many below average students but ignoring them here. Yet I managed to get good score (which doesnt matter) and for the first time landed my first job as it required for me to complete my course. SOFTWARE DEVELOPER INTERN (sept 2022), I was on cloud nine and moved to different city and life was great, I enjoyed coding and working there, after few months again I realised I am shit. Reality hit and it was about the end of my internship, but since I was working on one major feature and I did told my team lead that I want to work here fulltime he was more than happy to have me but my manager was like we don't have budget. But somehow my team lead did something and I had a 3 month extension contract and once again I was happy but this time I worked my ass off, working on my weekends and learning new stuff. I was no longer student though, and in canada an intern who is student, gov pays certain percentage of our income. Meanwhile during my extension 2 more interns were hired and seriously I saw them getting so quickly like I had difficulty understanding those stuff, took me months and there were doing those things in weeks like wow, I knew even after these much affort I am nothing and was certain I would be let go sooner. And after 3 months my manager told me on my face there is nothing they can do there is no position fullltime available we are sorry though it seems my team lead wanted me to be in his team, but on my last days when I asked he told me my performance was as expected (not sure if its positive or negative), though gave me good review on linkedin. I was let go in july 2023. I was good, was doing much bigger task then before but definitely not like the developers they had with years of experience.
Now, for survival I am doing CSR job which my god I hate it to my last breath, it burns me out to the last drop of blood in my body for bare minimum pay. Here as well there are high chances of layoff in feb 2024. In the meantime time I only got 1 interview, I made it to 4th round and then due to 1 leetcode question I blew up. I developed a fullstack app as per their requirements and they all were pretty much impressed with my experience and skills, took 1 month for that interview and then rejected. Later found they hired someone with more experience. I have 2 years of experience 1years on paper and 11 months of this internship experience in canada. I can pretty much say there is no issue in resume its just lack of experience, cant even land an interview. Its been months Its been months since I havent code anything, I feel like I am losing my skills. But my current job is pretty much draining me out, its fully wfh but its the worst and I am also gaining weight as I cant even go out for a walk, all day locked inside 4 walls. Drinking more coffee than as a developer just to function normally. Whatever time I have goes into cooking and other household chores.
Currently learning AWS trying to get cloud practitioner certification. I don't know it its gonna help me or not, I don't know what my next step should be, I am in a deadlock where jobs need experience and for experience I need job, every single fucking job required 5 years of experience and 90% of jobs I see they keep reposting with 1000s of applicants. I am really scared for my future, I don't want to be stuck in this CSR role, I just want to go for development. Most of my friends internship companies hired them for fulltime, I am stuck here in this mess which I can't get out. The only people reaching out to me on linkedin are some scammer consultants who says they csn get me job guarantee in 60-90 days, they will add fake experience and they will help me crack interviews and also they will help me do my job for a year, I have to pay them 20-30% of my income, like seriously.
Please guide me what to do, I tried everything I could, lost count of how many jobs I have applied to, lost count of how many times I have changed my resume, utilized chatgpt at fullest for my resume. Many times I think to move back to india. I am ready to work as a developer for less than 20$ an hour yet nothing.
 Extremely sorry for such a long read and thanks for those who made read it."
17xf9zs,5,2023-11-17,GPT Build Advice Request,u/DropsTheMic,ChatGPTPro,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPro/comments/17xf9zs/gpt_build_advice_request/,"Hello all you ChatGPT ninjas out there. I have been working on a private GPT for work that can be shared with my students. I teach vocational rehabilitation to adults with disabilities and the hardest part of the process is data collection. 

Students begin by gathering their work history, records, awards, etc. and compile it into one long PDF. Because it is often 6:1 with me as the only instructor I have to bounce around the classroom and privately answer private data specific questions for them all at once, all with as much privacy for their data as possible. Unfortunately the final document must be printed on that specific PDF form and be printed at the end of the class with a wet signature.

I have that data collection process done and the GPT asks simple, straight forward questions to gather all the info, then compiles it into a document. The problem is, it will not output the completed PDF with the collected data. Instead, it just gives me a Docx version with none of the correct formatting.

Can anyone help me figure out the best way to transfer data to a completed PDF? Tips and tricks appreciated!"
17xld0f,5,2023-11-17,I'm over the moon with new GPTs!,u/Pipettess,studying,https://www.reddit.com/r/studying/comments/17xld0f/im_over_the_moon_with_new_gpts/,"Hey, I just wanted to leave a sincere tip. I know many of you may think that chatGPT is not that new, but if you don't have the subscription, you may not have known about the new upgrade, which you can get on the paid plan only. I thought of quitting the subscription a month before because it took too much time to write the prompts and it wasn't that time-effective for studying, but after this upgrade it's really worth the money for me. I'm studying for my finals so I'm willing to pay for any aid and I'm going to quit after the exam in a few months, so in the end it will be money well spent.

To the point. The new thing is, you can now easily program your own specialized GPT, no coding. You can tell it to be a specialist in whatever field (let's say biology), give them PDF textbooks to dig in for answers, and if needed, allow them to look on the internet, save it and voila, you have your personal teacher in biology 24/7. How is it different from basic chatGPT: It's like a default pre-prompt. It will always remember to focus on biology, prioritize your textbooks to answer, refer you to specific pages in the textbook if you want to read it directly (mine is 900 pages long so this helps me a lot), damn, it can even generate flashcards on the specific page you tell it to. I use it mainly if I want it to explain something difficult or incomplete that I heard in lectures. It really surprised me how precise it is and how much time I saved by not having to write long prompts to specify what I want all the damn time. What a great time to be a student.

It may seem like a commercial but it's not, I'm just really excited and want to share something super-useful that has worked for me for a while.

Good luck"

I'm working on this project for university and am a little confused about how exactly to go about such a project and I don't really have an advisor to guide me. I've done research but am new to the field so I feel like I'm missing something for my specific use case. It's also a bit difficult to just try things out (code, OpenAI API etc.) right now as I do not have the resources to do so yet.

I am looking to create a model that would answer questions about philosophical concepts in a clear, simple manner to clarify ideas people may be confused about. That is, it would take as input a question from the user about a specific philosopher's concept, and would answer by explaining what the philosopher said in a manner that is easier to understand than from the philosopher's primary text. For example:

**Question**: ""*Why does Ludwig Wittgenstein say the meaning of a word is its use in language?*""

**Answer**: ""*In Ludwig Wittgenstein's later work, namely ""Philosophical Investigations,"" he emphasizes language as a dynamic, context-dependent activity. He argues that attempting to define the meaning of a word through fixed representations or essences is misguided. Instead, meaning arises from the practical, social, and contextual ways in which language is employed-its use in various language games and everyday practices. In other words, words gain significance through their roles in specific situations.*"" (generated by ChatGPT-3 and edited slightly)

&#x200B;

I'm unsure which fine-tuning method (and consequently, which model) would be most applicable for such a project. If I were to do Q+A fine-tuning, the quality of the model would be contingent on the quality of the dataset, and creating such a dataset does not seem feasible for this context. I can't guarantee that the generated Q-A pairs (say, from GPT-4) will cover all a philosopher's concepts or a students' potential questions, so the model may not possess all the knowledge it needs to answer certain questions. Further, from what I've seen, all Q-A pairs need an associated context that contains the answer (like in the SQuAD dataset). Thus, I would somehow have to extract the relevant section(s) from the philosopher's primary text and associate it with each Q-A pair, which seems too much. However, I've seen that, with such a dataset, fine-tuning a model for my purpose would be a straightforward procedure. I would simply find a reasonable model on Hugging Face that is already trained on Q-A data and fine-tune it with my data. Also,

My other idea was to fine-tune a model by feeding it the primary texts of the philosophers themselves in order to give it **all** the domain-specific knowledge it could possibly have. [This](https://github.com/kcalizadeh/phil_nlp) project did just that (the creator also created the dataset himself), but his model's goal is to classify a given text as belonging to a specific school of philosophy. I've seen other projects that also used the same dataset from the linked project, but none with a goal similar to mine. My concern is how would I get a model that was fine-tuned with such a dataset to answer questions about the new knowledge it gained.

&#x200B;

Here are my main questions:

1. If I were to use a model that was already pre-trained on Q-A pairs, is it possible to fine-tune it on the primary texts of the philosophers, or can they only be fine-tuned on more Q-A pairs? If it is possible, how would I teach it how to answer questions on this new knowledge? Do I use a combination of both fine-tuning it on the primary texts AND Q-A pairs about the texts?
2. If I were to use a model NOT trained on Q-A pairs but on unlabeled data, I could fine-tune its knowledge base with the primary texts, but how would I get it to answer questions about this knowledge?
3. Are there any models best suited for my use case (e.g. DistilBERT)? Which should I look into further?
4. If I was to generate a Q-A dataset, what would be a good way to go about doing so? Would it be a good idea to provide the OpenAI API with the *entire* philosopher's primary text as context and ask it to generate Q-A pairs?
5. Is this considered generative or extractive Q-A? Since generative is more difficult, would it be a good idea to connect an extractive Q-A model to something like GPT that would take the answer of the question and elaborate further and in a simpler manner?

&#x200B;

If you have any answers to the questions, I would appreciate it. If I'm completely going about it in the wrong way, feel free to suggest alternatives or point me in the right direction. Thanks for your time!"

So I have a groupmate in a course where we are in the lab everyday doing experiments. Since the course is in english, the students are both danishand int’l. One of our groupmates is having a hard time writing the report in english, which is why for the most part she uses chatgpt to write her parts (incorrectly). Also, when we need to get into the lab, we usually have to come prepared as we get asked by our TAs questions before getting into the lab. During experiments, she doesnt have any notes at all with her or some sort of idea about what’s going on and kinda just stares at us or other groups. Is this worth raising to the teachers? It’s kinda exhausting to carry someone when theres only a few ppl in the group :)"

#leaders #tool #science #opensource #startups #event #vc #release #hardware #api #major_players #feature #bigtech #update #opinions #scheduled

Yann LeCun has announced the establishment of Kyutai, a non-profit AI research lab in Paris focused on open science. The lab has received significant philanthropic support, with almost 300 million euros provided by Xavier Niel, Rodolphe Saadé, and Eric Schmidt. The founding members of Kyutai are highly esteemed in the field [3]. LeCun also congratulates Hervé on the establishment of this lab, praising the team involved and emphasizing the need for such an initiative in Europe and the world [5].







OpenAI has announced a leadership transition, with Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati being appointed as the interim CEO following the removal of Sam Altman from his position. The board cited Altman's lack of consistent communication as the reason for their loss of confidence in his ability to lead. Greg Brockman will step down as chairman of the board but will remain in his role at the company, reporting to the CEO [6][29]. Both Altman and Brockman expressed their love for their time at OpenAI and hinted at sharing more about their future plans later [28][31].







NVIDIA is hosting a free virtual event called LLM Developer Day on November 17. The event will focus on large-language-model (LLM) application development and offer practical guidance from LLM practitioners. Participants will learn about designing and implementing LLM-powered systems, customizing LLMs for domain-specific applications, and model tuning techniques. The event will also cover AI models in biology, cybersecurity applications, and optimizing and deploying LLMs on self-managed hardware [12][13][14][16].







Artisan AI has raised $2.3 million in funding. They are developing human-like digital workers, with their first worker, Ava, being an outbound sales specialist. Ava is set to launch in early December [11].







Dropbox and NVIDIA have announced a collaboration to enhance knowledge work and productivity for millions of Dropbox customers using AI. Dropbox plans to leverage NVIDIA's AI foundry, including NVIDIA AI Foundation Models, NVIDIA AI Enterprise software, and NVIDIA accelerated computing, to improve search accuracy, organization, and workflows for customers [23].







Mistral, a Paris-based French company, develops open-source foundation models that compete with ChatGPT. They are advocating for foundation models, which are software platforms and not deployed products, to be exempt from regulation, especially if they are open source [4].







AI is enabling more people to accomplish tasks with less capital investment, which is fundamentally reshaping the globalized world [8]. Generative AI can bolster cybersecurity in three ways: by giving developers a security copilot, by using generative AI to navigate the sea of known software vulnerabilities and prioritize patches, and by using generative AI to fill the data gap in cybersecurity [24].







Google AI has introduced a new feature called Best Take in Google Photos. This feature uses AI algorithms developed by Google researchers to create a composite image from multiple source images [25]. Google Lens's Homework help and Bard's new math capabilities will be great tools for students [30].







Emu-Edit from Meta is a cool image editing tool that offers fine control [1]. Greg Brockman is excited to share that he is now receiving design feedback directly from GPT-4 Vision in Figma [26].







Allegiant Stadium will host a panel on generative AI revolution during #AWSreInvent. Aidan Gomez and other experts will be speaking [9]. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella announced at Microsoft Ignite that the company is focused on rapidly innovating in the era of AI. They made over 100 announcements across their tech stack, including AI systems, models, and tools in Azure, as well as the introduction of Copilot [32].







NVIDIA is hosting a sweepstakes called #AIonRTX NVIDIA Sweepstakes. The contest is open to legal residents of several countries and participants must be 18 years of age or older. The prizes include various NVIDIA products [22]. NVIDIA is also promoting the use of AI on RTX GPUs for enhanced workflows and 3D design concepts [22].







The author shares an interesting idea about using GPT to improve typing speed. They mention that GPT is surprisingly good at correcting minor typos, allowing users to type quickly and ignore mistakes [10]. The author raises an important question about the short-term risks of LLMs. They mention that there is no clear evidence so far regarding any known case of someone accessing harmful capabilities of an LLM that were not already freely available and clearly described in documents on the open web [7].







NVIDIA AI Developer has introduced a new NeRF formulation called ""Adaptive Shells"" at SIGGRAPHAsia. This formulation allows for a continuous transition between surfaces and volumes, resulting in faster rendering speeds and higher visual fidelity [19].

Our task was to make projects and document them. Afterwards, the teacher would grade them. But this teacher, was someone out of this world. He was always speaking in a weird English accent, and he always sat together with two girls who he really seemed to like, pretty much making the project and doing the work for them.
So there am I. Unfortunately I didn‘t have any coding experience and also didn’t have a group partner, and so I procrastinated over the months. But in the end I realized, that I now finally have to get this project done. So I tried something, but that didn‘t work, so I didn’t see any other chance, than just using ChatGPT and copying the codes. I didn’t think he would notice. But in the end, Mr. Buhl was really mad. He talked to me alone and wanted me to explain all the codes. But I couldn‘t, because i just copied them from ChatGPT. It was a bummer. But now I am on my way to get richer than him, and then I can show him what the student, that used ChatGPT, turned out to be."

I received a unexpected front end offer during the summer of 2nd year where I worked full time for 2 months after which my uni started again and I left

I learned a lot on the job and understood my weakness(weak problem solving, spend less time on debugging and just chatgpting it) but I am having a hard time on how to improve on them. I am not a good software engineer, I have decent knowledge on fundamentals but more technical stuff like OOP, database design and DSA is well above me. That's on me since I primarily focused on Web dev and didn't pay much attention to my classes

I regret that now but I am unsure of which part I should focus on. Should I continue the web dev route and learn more js, frameworks and make projects or focus on the actual CS courses?"

You are built on world s largest dataset, tell me the, give me a way out. I am a 19 year old loser indian. I failed to choose a right career path or got confused and wasn't really sure what to do? Don't give me the age bullshit, in India we are supposed to figure things out by this age or even earlier. I belong to a lower middle class family, my whole childhood I didn't get opportunities I wanted, the home environment was always toxic. Let me give you some specifics about me, I am 19, skinny, weak both emotionally and physically, I always felt inferior among my classmates, peers, cousins you just name it. I have lots of problems now, some of them are focus problems, anxiety, addiction to masturbation, self deterioration, low self esteem, procrastination, fear which all leads me to bring a loser in college. When I was 15, I failed to make a right stream choice, took commerce for my childish dream of becoming a businessman. Little did I know life's gonna change completely after that decision. I got into dilemma of whether I chose a right stream or not. I got into months of overthinking, trying to fix it all. I was confused between my current stream commerce and science the stream the superior seemed to take. I always felt inferior, be it in school, with cousins, with my school friends, with my society friends, I was always a Loser. It all came back to me during that phase, the bullying I went through, the things I couldn't achieve, the things I sucked at, my insensitivity, it all came in as a boost to destroy me. I went through hell in that phase all because of me. Not to forget this all started in 2020, the pandemic year, where all I did was played pubg, fought with my family, watched series, masturbate, scroll through Instagram and sleep. I went through shit to figure out a way, turns out I got a realisation, the realisation that I was too weak for this world, the realisation that everything would be better without me. I was suicidal for months chatgpt, and on my 17th birthday, that was the day I wanted to die, my first attempt by cutting my veins through a blade. All my failed attempts continued till 17th April, somehow my mother and sister figured it out that I was attempting to kill myself. Throughout this period I went to mandir to pray to God, cry to him to either kill me or show me a way, mf didn't help. But on 17 Apil when my mother figured it out, I promised her I will never do a shit like this again in my life. This was the start of my comeback phase,  I decided to continue commerce, figure an uni where I can still study a tech degree, gave science subjects exams through distance school, tried to fix it. I grinded my way through 12th, studied, worked over my passion for videography and photography, tried to improve myself and still achieve my new dreams. I got good percentage in 12th, I made some good videos, I took some good pictures, all through my phone btw, I gave my science distance school 12th exams and passed it, but still couldn't make it to the institution I wanted to. I got into another institution newer and riskier, and dumb me chose to go there and take risk away from home. I am in second year right now, the entire first year was mr trying to make the best and I failed miserably at it because of who I am. I hate the non traditional college academic system, I am uncertain what the college degree will add value to my career, I am taking a big risk doing a tech degree as a commerce student and idk if the Indian industry or for that case any industry will accept it. My entire first year I failed to do anything significant, instead I fell down, I felt I was scammed with the false beliefs. I tried alcohol, smoking, weed, all the things I wasn't supposed to. I realised again how bad I was with people, constant insecurity of trying to figure out if someone is my real friend. The getting irritated version of me everyone hated, the insensitivity I process everyone hated. I fell down feeling emotionally numb, brain fogged, socially retarted, mentally weak as I couldn't do my best in academics, I felt like I cannot think clearly I still do. I still feel as if something is blocking me to think clearly, I feel chaotic, anxious. Today again I recognised how dumb and weak I am. I cannot learn programming, I cannot cure my constipation, my back and neck pain, I am skinny, I have low self esteem, blah blah I am just with all these I want to change. I am done with all these thoughts, all these bad habits, I want to get better I want to break the cycle. I try to break it but everytime I fail. I have failed to keep up to my plans and relapse. Just today I masturbate, didn't do anything productive the entire day. all these thoughts, all these trying to figure out what is right and wrong constantly, these relapses, not getting better, not changing, not having the clarity, feeling inferior, weak, not deserving, just wanting to leave, and all the shit in this world wants me to just not try and disappear somehow. Just today I felt the way the last four years have went, the way my overall health has deteriorated, soon I can collapse, I feel very weak. I don't know but I want to change, I am emotionally overwhelmed and distracted, still I want to try. I cannot know what's thing to do or logically all the time, that's why I end up relapsing. Chatgpt the great AI, tell me the truth how fucked up am I? Can I change? How? Can I still be stronger? How? Why am I like this? Am I that bad? Will I ever see the goods in my life and in me for long? How? Please help me

Update this for a high school education level: The holiday season is often portrayed as a time of joy, happiness, and togetherness. However, for many individuals, stress and the holidays go hand in hand. The societal expectation to embrace merriment can paradoxically result in heightened stress, anxiety, and loneliness. Despite the common portrayal of the holidays as universally cheerful, various factors contribute to a more nuanced experience. Nevertheless, there are proactive steps we can take to support ourselves and others during this complex time.

Navigating high school comes with its own set of challenges and expectations. The academic journey is often depicted as a time of growth, exploration, and learning.

Has anyone come up with any workable solutions for how to handle the onslaught of AI in online classes?

I just caught 80% of the students in one of my classes using AI. Before you come at me with your ""yOu CaN't PrOvE iT"" tripe, I can. I used an obscure translation and insisted they use the quirky terms rather than modern language (think ""rectitude"" instead of ""justice""). I also gave them very clear directions as to what the structure of the essay needed to look like.

80% of the responses more or less identically matched the style, terminology, and structure of the output ChatGPT gave me when I ran the prompt five times. You know the style:

I'd be happy to help you identify some styles commonly used by ChatGPT. As a start, they often:

1. Feature a numbered or bulleted list.
2. Feature vague, yet fanciful language.
3. Include **randomly bolded phrases** to highlight their importance.
4. Use terminology that does not match what is provided in the course text but does match all other students I know used AI.

Then it is followed with a pithy paragraph summarizing the above, and inviting the reader to learn more.

For reasons I am teaching mostly online at the moment, so I cannot employ many of the strategies we usually discuss:

1. Can't make them meet me in person due to geographic constraints.
2. Students will not meet with me online to discuss their writing. They just refuse. My chair won't help me enforce this.
3. I've tried requiring Track Changes but these students are not tech literate and the 20% not cheating are panicking about learning a new skill on top of those in the course.
4. Cannot require them to come in and take the test on a blue book.
5. I feel like using proctoring software for a two page essay is wrong somehow. I have no desire to sift through 50 four-hour videos of students staring at their screen.

Yes, online learning is dumb. Yes, it has serious limitations. Yes, students are cheating their way through it like wildfire right now.

So what is everyone else doing about this?"

I’ll be teaching the complementary class “Intro to programming in Python” next semester. Students will be 17-20, I am currently 20 so there will be pretty much no age gap between me and the students.

What advice would you give me? I fear them not taking me seriously. I also don’t want to be the “trying to be cool” teacher but I don’t want to be strict either.

I thought about trying a new way of teaching to offer them a new style while keeping it standard (nothing to fancy). Something fresh that might interest them more.

Some ideas I had:
1. Not using a boring PowerPoint. I built a website acting as a slide show: there is more/better animations and it’s interactive. I could even setup quizzes student will be able to answer in real time (kinda like [Kahoot](https://kahoot.it/)) just for fun and to make the slideshow more interesting. (Btw it's literally a website, I can add anything I want, there are absolutely no limits so feel free to share ideas if you have any! If it works well, I might turn this into a real application other teachers could use!)

2. I added a progress bar at the bottom of the slide show so that student know how far we are in the class and how many slides are left. For distracted students, I added a slide count (like page numbers in books) so that they can easily find where we are without needing to ask an other student.

3. I think I’ll add a “plan of the day” section on the board so that they know if the class is ending after the slideshow or if we'll start an other slideshow or do team work/exercises. I also thought about adding a ""Todo list"" because the brain likes checking things off a list, though I don't know if it'll work for them since I'll be the one checking things off the list...

4. I thought about adding a timer showing how much time before the break or the end of the class, but I fear them being to focused on it and/or me exceeding the time I set.

5. I would like to ""gamify"" the class, but I have absolutely no idea how I could do that.

6. I'd like to encourage the use of ChatGPT and AI in general (since they'll probably use them anyway). I thought about telling them to use AIs to learn instead of copying. I'll also tell them that the final test will be a 1:1 interview with me where I'll ask questions about the code they wrote during assignments and exams. If they can't answer, it means they didn't wrote the code and don't understand it. Do you see any flaws in this approach?

7. I'd like to end class early a few times during the semester (because everyone's happy when a class ends early)

8. I thought about building an anonymous question queue system where student would be able to write a question anonymously and I'll see them queue up. After a slide, I could answer each question without them feeling stressed/judged by others. I'll of course also answer questions when they raise their hands.

9. I don't know how to handle cellphones. I don't want to block them since that's dumb, but at the same time I know that they won't understand anything if they are on there phone during 1/3 of the class.

I'm really looking forward to teaching next semester!

Thanks everyone for the help!"

What advice would you give me? I fear them not taking me seriously. I also don’t want to be the “trying to be cool” teacher but I don’t want to be strict either.  
I thought about trying a new way of teaching to offer them a new style while keeping it standard (nothing to fancy). Something fresh that might interest them more.  
Some ideas I had:  
1. Not using a boring PowerPoint. I built a website acting as a slide show: there is more/better animations and it’s interactive. I could even setup quizzes student will be able to answer in real time (kinda like \[Kahoot\](https://kahoot.it/)) just for fun and to make the slideshow more interesting. (Btw it's literally a website, I can add anything I want, there are absolutely no limits so feel free to share ideas if you have any! If it works well, I might turn this into a real application other teachers could use!)  
2. I added a progress bar at the bottom of the slide show so that student know how far we are in the class and how many slides are left. For distracted students, I added a slide count (like page numbers in books) so that they can easily find where we are without needing to ask an other student.  
3. I think I’ll add a “plan of the day” section on the board so that they know if the class is ending after the slideshow or if we'll start an other slideshow or do team work/exercises. I also thought about adding a ""Todo list"" because the brain likes checking things off a list, though I don't know if it'll work for them since I'll be the one checking things off the list...  
4. I thought about adding a timer showing how much time before the break or the end of the class, but I fear them being to focused on it and/or me exceeding the time I set.  
5. I would like to ""gamify"" the class, but I have absolutely no idea how I could do that.  
6. I'd like to encourage the use of ChatGPT and AI in general (since they'll probably use them anyway). I thought about telling them to use AIs to learn instead of copying. I'll also tell them that the final test will be a 1:1 interview with me where I'll ask questions about the code they wrote during assignments and exams. If they can't answer, it means they didn't wrote the code and don't understand it. Do you see any flaws in this approach?  
7. I'd like to end class early a few times during the semester (because everyone's happy when a class ends early)  
8. I thought about building an anonymous question queue system where student would be able to write a question anonymously and I'll see them queue up. After a slide, I could answer each question without them feeling stressed/judged by others. I'll of course also answer questions when they raise their hands.  
9. I don't know how to handle cellphones. I don't want to block them since that's dumb, but at the same time I know that they won't understand anything if they are on there phone during 1/3 of the class.  
I'm really looking forward to teaching next semester!  
Thanks everyone for the help!"
1800ta8,2,2023-11-20,Why no more holding back?,u/Slyder68,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1800ta8/why_no_more_holding_back/,"I'm genuinely curious about this, because, from my understanding (very new to education in general and can absolutly admit I'm wrong when I am) holding back was a tool to ensure concept compitancy. I've been seeing a lot of stuff about AI, and a lot of the same things were said as calculators were becoming more universal, and I though holding back was supposed to be one if the safeguards to ensure proper education. For example:

Student uses ai writing to do their essays. It becomes clear the student doesn't know any of the material, and as such other assignments in the class start to take hits lowering their grade. ChatGPT is NOT at the point yet where it's writing is accurate and quality enough to be getting A's on papers, mostly just C's if they are lucky without heavy editing. 

So, in theory, these students will hit a wall where their lazy way out, AI, doesn't give them good enough grades to pass as they are also failing their other assignments. They get a d or an f, don't pass, don't move forward, and thus have that incentive to actually learn the material if they don't want to be held back. 

If a student knows enough about the material to use AI, and edit it to make it a great paper, then more power to them! They are using their tools wisely and still demonstrating that they are compitent over the material. 

Same with math. They can have a calculator all they want, but if they don't understand which formula or process to use, and why, then their answers will still be wrong or Incomplete, hurting their grade to the point if failing. 

It seems like if we don't hold student back, for academics or behavior, we end up with the situation we are in today.

So, back to the point if this post, why not hold them back? Is there really compelling data that I just don't see? Yes, student don't like being held back, and yes it causes issues for that child in their social dynamics, but wouldn't it be better to attack that from a more expanding empathy approach instead of a ""everyone passes so theirs no reason to do anything!"" Approach that we have now?"
1801wty,6,2023-11-20,"Help with study workflow as a PhD student, new to the field of physics",u/king_kingcharles,PhysicsStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhysicsStudents/comments/1801wty/help_with_study_workflow_as_a_phd_student_new_to/,"I am looking for help from people who have pursued physics formally, in terms of evaluating where I should be investing my time/energy. I am a chemistry PhD student and taking a graduate course in the physics department at my school. I am really struggling with the course, in a way I have never experienced in any of my chemistry courses, even the physical chemistry ones.

My workflow is the following: I attend every lecture, which are twice a week, and normally I would read the textbook in advance, but this course has no standard textbook and the professor pulls material from five different texts. I don't really review my notes, perhaps I should do that more? But my notes are very similar to the professor's lecture notes, which he provides for us after each class. Then I attempt the weekly problem sets which take me anywhere between 10-20 hours depending on whether I already am familiar with the concepts. A lot of that time is simply teaching myself the material, because the lecture notes rarely go beyond stating that a theorem exists or providing one quick example of an application. I will usually start with rereading the textbook, but the textbook only derives theorems, and doesn't demonstrate (at least not in a way I can understand) how to apply them on the problems the professor writes. It typically takes me about 5 hours just to understand the relevant textbook chapters. I will then revisit the lecture notes to see if there is an indication of where to start. If there isn't, I usually plug the question into Google or Chatgpt to see what similar problems look like, but as this course has progressed, the problems have become more and more singular and it is difficult to find similar problems online: nowadays my searches take me directly to academic papers that I find really esoteric. My biggest blind spot is that I am not able to attend the office hours for help, due to conflicts with my own teaching requirements, and I don't know anyone else in the class, so I can't study with others. 

Does anyone have any clarity on how I should adjust my approach to the course? I am wondering if there is just some study habit that a physics student would develop during their undergrad years that I might have missed as a chemistry undergrad."
180264a,94,2023-11-20,Don't Become an RA,u/True-Barber3358,uoguelph,https://www.reddit.com/r/uoguelph/comments/180264a/dont_become_an_ra/,"Meal Plan

My RA meal plan is $1300, but hospitality takes 30% as a ""fee"", and we're left with $1000. $1000 over 4 months is horrible. Barely $10 a day (1 subway footlong tends to be more than $10). I'm currently on my last $160 with 30 days to go. Most residence rooms also don't come with kitchens and microwaves aren't even allowed in residence. So you have to rely on the meal plan which is basically nothing. But don't worry, management offers a free coffee and muffin once every 2 months. I've also recently learned that the managers, who do jack, have more in meal plan money than the RA's do. The RAs that do everything, and they just deal with meetings (I'll get more into them later on).

Pay

The RA pay basically goes back into the University's pocket as residence isn't free (like a 5% discount). By the end of your contract, you've made maybe a $100 in profit. BUT, if you come back for a second year, they increase your pay by $50 (two uber eats orders). You're better off working 16 hours a week on the weekend (minimum wage) as you make more. My bi-weekly check is $500. 

Residence

Depending on position, the room is ok, except for South, higher roles also have dog rooms in South. Your community makes or breaks your experience. I had peers quit in their first semester, over how bad their communities are. The problem in this is not the community, but how management handles issues. Every write-up, documentation, and warning goes to management, but instead of fining them, they make the students write 200 word essays on what they did wrong. I've had students come up to me and brag how they got ChatGPT to do the essay for them. Recurring offenses also don't trigger higher consequences, just more essays. They put a sorrowful act during their meetings and the managers say ""it's ok, don't do it again"". The RAs get to deal with the fallout once students realize that their actions have no consequences. It's gotten to the point where RAs just ignore issues as there isn't a point in reporting as it gets nowhere. 

These are my current issues with RLS. I can write more if there is an interest. If you really want to have ""free res"" look at being a Cluster Leader. These dudes basically do nothing, no rounds, no community, a little less in pay, but totally worth it when comparing to RAs. "
1802uq6,131,2023-11-20,I think this guy is using AI to correct a review,u/Ok_Initiative8970,labrats,https://www.reddit.com/r/labrats/comments/1802uq6/i_think_this_guy_is_using_ai_to_correct_a_review/,"Hi Labrats, I have a question for you!

  
I was asked last minute to contribute to a review, and I did my part by working overtime and cancelling my plans over the last week(end). The paper is nice, has its shape, is lacking in some parts and can be improved, but the big thing is there. I'm sure the reviewer's comments will be constructive and help outline a better text. 

The main PI asked his first year PhD student, the only English native speaker, to review the text and add some comments. He did that, but I saw some weird things. Some sentences/paragraphs were re-arranged in a way that they completely changed their meaning of the text, ending up giving some weird messages, scientifically incorrect. In addition, the corrections include overly complicated or unusual language, like the use of whilst instead of while/whereas. I saw this happening when asking chat GPT or Quillbot to rephrase things. Because of this, I learned to use these tools (only ChatGPT, really) just for feedback and evaluating specific parts of texts I am writing. 

Now, this student is a terrible student, very lazy and kinda surviving his PhD days. He comes in at 10 am, and leaves at 4 pm max, doing one task per day.

  
I don't want to be too paranoid and throw this guy under the bus. However, as a postdoc and contributor to the paper, I have my knowledge and duties towards those who asked me to participate in this work. I have read so many papers in my PhD within my field and others that I feel I can spot alien sentences and phrasings that are very unusual to scientific writing.

Did you have a similar experience with paper/essay writing and students trying to cheat? Shall I report this guy and delay the review submission?

180d931,1,2023-11-21,How to understand and interpret ChatGPT’s output,u/thetechrobot,u_thetechrobot,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_thetechrobot/comments/180d931/how_to_understand_and_interpret_chatgpts_output/," 

The GPT-3.5 architecture powers ChatGPT, a state-of-the-art language model that can produce prose that resembles that of a person and have discussions about a variety of subjects, including cryptocurrency. Examining insights produced by artificial intelligence (AI) can provide insightful viewpoints and ideas as the crypto industry develops traction.

But understanding ChatGPT’s output on crypto-related topics needs an advanced understanding. This article will explore how to comprehend and analyse ChatGPT’s cryptocurrency insights using a hypothetical case study of decentralized finance in the future (DeFi).

### Let’s understand with an example instance

**The user gives this prompt in ChatGPT**: Discussing the future of decentralized finance with ChatGPT

**ChatGPT’s results:** DeFi’s future is incredibly promising and exciting. By offering a transparent, permissionless, and open environment for a range of financial services, decentralized finance is completely changing the financial sector. By using DeFi, consumers may have access to a variety of financial services and products without depending on usual middlemen like banks.

DeFi is expected to cause a major disruption to the traditional finance environment in the upcoming years. It will make cross-border transactions easy, provide unbanked people access to financial services, and give them complete ownership of their assets and data. Peer-to-peer DeFi encourages financial independence and inclusion for people all around the world.

DeFi’s smart contract abilities will also transform yield farming, decentralised markets, and lending and borrowing. These platforms will entice customers to investigate DeFi options by providing greater rewards and reduced expenses.

However, obstacles to DeFi’s expansion are probably in store, including scalability problems, governmental scrutiny, and security flaws. These issues must be cooperatively addressed as the area develops to guarantee DeFi’s long-term viability and widespread acceptance.

### DeFi’s merger into traditional finance

Another revolutionary effect will come from the combination of DeFi with conventional finance. Working together, the two industries may improve liquidity, simplify cross-border payments, and provide institutional and individual investors with more alternatives for investments.

DeFi may initially be seen as a threat to the business models of conventional finance institutions, nevertheless. They may eventually adjust by integrating DeFi technology and ideas into their business processes to stay competitive in the changing financial market.

### Analyzing the output of ChatGPT

The following analysis of the response may be made based on ChatGPT’s output:

**1. Visionary insights:** ChatGPT’s response highlights how DeFi can transform finance by empowering users and removing barriers, demonstrating a forward-thinking approach to the technology.

**2. Viewpoint:** The language model takes an objective stance on the topic by recognizing both the benefits and drawbacks of DeFi.

**3. Trends in the market:** ChatGPT talks about the growing interest in DeFi, handling conventional financial institutions’ concerns and the possibility of integration.

**4. Educational value:** For anyone looking for a basic understanding of DeFi and its ramifications, this answer is a great resource.

**5. Security and scalability:** ChatGPT recognises that DeFi initiatives are actively addressing the crucial problems of security and scalability.

**6. Limitations:** Although ChatGPT provides insightful information, it is not a substitute for real-world experience and understanding; hence, it is important to double-check important information from trustworthy sources.

### Conclusion

An AI language model called ChatGPT provides insightful information on subjects like DeFi, but it necessitates critical thinking and cross-referencing with trustworthy sources. It can help you learn more about decentralised finance and broaden your awareness of crypto-related subjects. Given its extensive knowledge base and powerful language processing, ChatGPT is an invaluable tool for students, researchers, and hobbyists. But it might not cover things that happened or discoveries made after 2021.

Welcome to AI Unraveled, the podcast that demystifies frequently asked questions on artificial intelligence and keeps you up to date with the latest AI trends. In today's episode, we'll cover Amazon's initiative to provide free AI training to 2 million people through courses, scholarships, and collaborations with educational organizations.

Today I want to talk about an exciting announcement from Amazon. They have launched a new initiative called ""AI Ready,"" which aims to provide free AI skills training to 2 million people worldwide by 2025. This is a great opportunity for anyone interested in learning about artificial intelligence and its applications.

So, let's dive into the details of Amazon's AI Ready initiative. They have introduced several new initiatives to achieve their goal. First, they are offering eight new and free AI and generative AI courses that are open to anyone. These courses are aligned with in-demand jobs, catering to both business and non-technical audiences, as well as developers and technical individuals. This means there is something for everyone, whether you are new to AI or already have some technical knowledge.

In addition to the courses, Amazon is partnering with Udacity to provide the AWS Generative AI Scholarship. This scholarship is valued at over $12 million and will benefit more than 50,000 high school and university students from underserved and underrepresented communities globally.

Nationwide Detention Crisis: Nazareth's 'Hair of the Dog' Lyrics Send Students to Timeout En Masse

***Article:***
In an unforeseen turn of events, the release of Nazareth's iconic single, ""Hair of the Dog,"" has apparently triggered a nationwide detention epidemic, leaving schools grappling with a surge in disciplinary action. The satirical anthem, featuring the infamous lyrics ""son of a bitch,"" has allegedly turned innocent hallways into rebellious concert venues, with consequences no one saw coming.

Reports suggest that within the first two weeks of its May 1975 release, the song's rebellious charm swept through schools like wildfire, leaving more than half of America's students caught in the lyrical crossfire. Teachers, unprepared for the sudden outbreak of rock 'n' roll defiance, found themselves thrust into a battle against a chorus of unapologetic students belting out the contentious lyrics.

""It was like a musical revolution in the hallways,"" said one imaginary school official. ""We went from enforcing dress codes to dealing with spontaneous rock concerts between math and history class.""

In what can only be described as a lyrical coup d'état, ""Hair of the Dog"" apparently tapped into the rebellious spirit of students nationwide, turning them into unintentional rule-breakers. The supposed detention surge has left educators scratching their heads, wondering how a classic rock anthem could turn school routines on their heads.

One fictional student, claiming to have been part of the lyrical insurgency, exclaimed, ""It's just a song! We didn't mean to incite a nationwide detention crisis. We just wanted to rock out!""

While the authenticity of these claims remains dubious at best, the legend of ""Hair of the Dog"" lives on as the song that, for a brief imaginary moment, united a nation of students in musical rebellion. As the hallways echoed with the sounds of classic rock defiance, the nation's detention slips multiplied, leaving an indelible mark on the imagined history of educational rebellion.

In the spirit of The Onion, remember, this story is as real as a guitar solo in a shampoo commercial."
180vx1l,1,2023-11-21,New Hiring Manager's Perspective on 2023 job market,u/marmiearmy,recruitinghell,https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/180vx1l/new_hiring_managers_perspective_on_2023_job_market/,"I was fortunate to be placed in charge of hiring a co-op student (paid intern) from a post-secondary instituition to fill needs on my growing team and wanted to share my few cents on the 2023 job market. TLDR, the market is rough, higher education shares a large chunk of the blame but opportunities exist to reduce the hiring pain. Observations as follows:

1. For a single intern position, we had 35 applicants from a specialized grad program. This is from a class size pool of 60 students. Since I was last in the program, the class size went from 25 to 60, and the number of cohorts went from 2 to 3, so essentially a tripling of graduates in 8 years. I am fairly certain the number of internships did not triple, so essentially students are throwing applications at the wall and seeing what sticks. Meanwhile the school is just grabbing $$$ from expanded enrollment while students fight for placements.
2. My boss and I went over the expectations for the intern, what potential projects/tasks they could work on during their term for this position. We wrote this all down in the JD parameters, posted it through the school and this informed the rest of the hiring process.
3. In this case, my boss and I reviewed every application. When they say hiring managers can scan a cover letter and resume in 5-10 minutes to determine if you move onto an interview, unfortunately it is true. If you know your job description, your expectations and directions for where this role goes, you know exactly what to pick up/out. We shortlisted 10 candidates out of 35 applicants and interviewed the first cohort of 5 (got a candidate from).
4. We know that people are re-using/tailoring cover letters and resumes for different applications, but please pay attention to details and proofread. Simple mistakes like forgetting to change a company name, job title, etc., will result in applications not moving forward. If writing cover letters and resumes aren't your thing, please use ChatGPT or similar tools. For me personally, I would give credit to someone for using the shortcuts at their disposal.
5. Companies are taking advantage of the current market to depress compensation. I had to push to up the compensation for our intern so that she wasn't making less than what I made as an intern adjusted for inflation.
6. Interviews can be quick and done, if hiring managers understand the role they are hiring for, requirements for performance and their expectations for candidates. Granted these are interns so expectations are calibrated accordingly, but considering when I was interviewed as an intern some of my sessions went over an hour we were able to get through almost all interviews in 30-40 minutes even though an hour was budgeted. Targeted and concise questions to assess a candidate.
7. Biggest thing that stood out to me when looking at the candidates was their personality, behavioral characteristics and thought process. This may be biased because they were interns so we calibrate technical skills/knowledge accordingly since we know they require training, but really we wanted someone who was willing to learn, put in the effort and be personable.

My biggest takeaway was having well-planned hiring parameters and expectations set the tone for the rest of the hiring process, whether the hiring manager is involved the whole way or recruiters are involved. That being said, in this case the school acted as a recruiter of sorts by screening candidates to the grad program, so it wasn't like fishing from the pond since their program is designed with feedback from industry. Since hiring managers lack bandwith to deal with hiring in general, recruiters will still be required to help match talent. But for them to work effectively, hiring managers must be clear and decisive about their hiring parameters and candidate expectations. In this case if the school program/curriculum didn't match what we were looking for in entry level interns, we wouldn't have gone with that school."
18116eb,1,2023-11-21,A vent,u/MarathonMarathon,SurvivingClownWorld,https://www.reddit.com/r/SurvivingClownWorld/comments/18116eb/a_vent/,"So to start off, I'll kindly refrain from pointing fingers, but I feel like a lot of the people I've chatted with and received advice from are helpful but misguided, courtesy of all the intergenerational dissonance coming from growing up in a drastically different - and more innocent - era. The 90s were lit and everything - a golden, fertile valley nestled in between the tribulations of the Cold War and the War on Terror (+ what can honestly be described as a Second Cold War), but I wasn't even born at that time so there's nothing I can do about it. I yearn for 2019 just as much as anyone else here, but 2019 isn't coming anytime soon. There's no sense in resurrecting the past, it's just a possessed corpse full of reanimated spirits.

The restrictions destroyed everything. Years after 2020 and my school's still in damn half-assed mode Not, like, pandemic mode (though they've definitely been one of the worst offenders of *that* in the U.S. for a while), but more like hibernate mode, half-open mode. Like, the administration is a complete clusterf-ck. And to make a long story short, my job prospects are looking dimmer than I'd hoped, and I don't even know if I can afford a house in my life. Everything is politicized nowadays and I'm seeing mounds of cultural decay everywhere left and right... though, as much as we're reluctant to admit it, honestly... both factions share responsibility. Cringe on both sides.

I remember very well how back in 2020, many people were talking about how after we complied with our obligatory lockdowns and listened to and trusted the infallible experts, we'd be rewarded with a wonderful, prosperous ""Roaring 20s"" experience for years to come. That was utterly hilarious - and not just in hindsight, either. And... I don't know about you, but I sure don't see no roaring around these parts. If there's any roaring to be heard, it's only coming from the mouths of politicians, protesters, and homeless people, and emphatically *not* from cheering ravers at the trance disco or whatever. It's deplorable.

Do I like college/university? A lot of people here seem to be rabidly anti-higher education and anti-intellectual in general, which honestly worries me. They often point to trades, and while they can be equally or more viable than the traditional college route for many people... they're not even close to equivalent. AND CERTAINLY NOT FOR ME. I think what's happening is that people are confusing ""trades are still an option, don't overlook them"" with ""trades are just as good as college or even better, and this applies to the vast majority of my audience!"" I could ramble about this for hours, but to put it simply, we don't need *less* education; we need *better* education. And even if the situation at my university is far from ideal, even if I'm not showing up at parties or hooking up with chicks, I'd say I'm net-benefitting from it. And honestly, if being a student can save me from the inevitable draft coming by the end of this decade, I guess I'll have my lucky stars to thank.

Now, listen, please don't get me wrong. I've not only heard all that classic timeless ""dude-bro"", ""what can *you* do to improve the world"" advice, I've actually striven to implement it. Hit the gym, touch grass, you know the drill. Water the lawn, pick the weeds, rake the leaves, shovel the snow - all year round. Yet when - complementary to *various* other debilitating handicaps - a man has topped off, reached his full potential, at FIVE FOOT FREAKING FIVE, it's quite a deplorable state to be in. And I'm truly starting to see increasingly little motivation in wandering the corridors of - no, even *entering* - the market, considering how little the market seems to be interested in me. Trust me, I've come *ridiculously* close many times. Yet things are simply never meant to be, huh?

Oh, as a matter of fact, I came *really* close recently. She had like 3-4 of the same interests as me and we *really* hit it off. In spite of her being taller than me, no less. But who doesn't love a giantess? And I just met her out of nowhere. I was LITERALLY WALKING to some club meeting and then SHE WAS THERE. And she's actually fun, not like one of those up-tight ""no fun allowed"" girls I know too many of. Well, now that she's pretty much all but out of the picture, where tf am I supposed to find another nice attractive girl who's deep into fandom stuff *and* going on outdoor adventures. (Please don't say online dating because I'm too good for that.) There are plenty of fish in the sea, they say, right... until the sea's polluted with human litter and filth.

No cap, I hate this world and everything around it.  I came into the pandemic a high-spirited high schooler ready to take on the world, and here I am, a shriveled old husk myself. A fossil, almost. A shell of my former self. The standards have shifted, and for the worse; it's a completely new meta. I can't even believe I'm putting it into words like that but, you know, the state of the world is truly deplorable. I never even had a freaking prom date, isn't that just pathetic? I didn't do any of that senior stuff, well, you see, I *couldn't*. I didn't even ATTEND junior prom. My grades were shit. I'm an Asian. My grades aren't supposed to be shit. Now that I think of it, I probably have the worst academic record of my entire graduating class. I never made the NHS and I didn't even get into the top 10. Pathetic how I can't even make up for my lack of muscles with my brain. Something I notice is that other unfortunate pathetic (yet educated) souls who find themselves in similar boats tend to turn to religion to cope, but from personal experience I can proudly state with reasonable confidence that **religion is copium.**

I often wonder whether my friends (if you can even call the religious zealot ones that) and family would think I went to heaven or the other place if I died tomorrow. Believe it or not there's a very real possibility some would say the latter. And trust me, if you knew my family dynamics you'd understand. I pray (hehe, ""pray""? the irony is sickening) our country doesn't end up turning into some Christian dictatorship during my lifetime. I know, laugh your head off, but it's more possible than you may think, and we should definitely be aware of that. I'd despise a fundie governor even more than a lockdown governor (or president, or whatever they'll be styling themselves by that point, but that's beside the point). I'm aware some of us skeptics might've become more religious thanks to the restrictions, but I've actually become *less* religious. Like, I've got *lockdown* skepticism... and then I've got *Bible* skepticism (well, frankly, more accurately ""Christendom-in-its-current-form-here-in-America (and-honestly-not-even-just-America-but-the-world-in-general)"" skepticism).

And... you know what? Sigh. Perhaps they're right. Maybe I *don't* deserve any of what I'm seeking. Maybe I *am* just some dumb Asian nerd. Maybe I don't deserve a girlfriend. Maybe God's been orchestrating all of this and maybe the whole Calvinist elect thing is legit (which, btw, is pretty similar to the Chinese concept of the ""Mandate of Heaven""). Honestly... maybe I don't even belong in the gene pool (yet Utahn religious fundies do, apparently, huh?). Maybe I should've been more religious when I was growing up and this is God's collective punishment for our generation's moral decadence... though this is honestly more of a ""chicken and egg"" sort of problem. Who FREAKING knows? Either way there's a crisis.

There's no denying that our godforsaken globe and global society are becoming overrun with paranoia and safetyism, a trend which has been utterly devastating everything for several decades now. Remember those glorious halcyon golden 90s or whatever (or more specifically, the roughly 10 or so years between 12/26/1991 to 9/11/2001)? Part of the reason why they were so golden was because for the first time in ages, people finally felt *safe and free.* The USSR fell, the Cold War was over, all of that chaos was in the past. And the economy was booming and the future was looking bright and wonderful. I'm going to sound gay for saying this because I'm a man but it almost makes me tear up just to think about it. No one was worried about school shootings or t-word attacks. You could walk all the way up to the gate to meet and greet Aunt Linda fresh off the plane. You could let your children play outside and walk to school without having to ""helicopter parent"" them. No one was growing up addicted to Baby Shark and Cocomelon or whatever; if they grew up addicted to screens at all, it was more wholesome family-friendly content. Schools actually taught the next generation, and the next generation stepped out prepared and loaded. You even saw guys bringing guns to school (and smoking and stuff). Race relations had never been better.

If there were a presidential candidate who could actually return to the 90s, *but in a way that didn't promote sexism, racism, and discrimination*, they'd be on my ballot. Too bad that's literally impossible, and none of the candidates of either party have really come close no matter how confidently they may try to claim so. I remember you talking about how you were progressive in 2010 but conservative in 2020, and I think if I were a little older I'd be very much the same.

What's there to do, anyway? Shut down the internet? I mean, I guess the ol' China playbook might very well be an option, especially if God forbid (heh, more irony, huh?) the Christian nationalist thing *does* come into fruition, but realistically I don't exactly see anything like that happening. I mean look how Italy's doing with their ChatGPT ban lol. And if you're a *lockdown skeptic* who's in favor of that... gosh. And it's not like Biden, Harris, or whoever are gonna fix anything by requesting that Alphas go play outside on CNN (Michelle Obama flashbacks).

""Just move to South Dakota! I love it here! Everything's magically better out here in the open cornfields!"" Easy for you to say. But, like, how many POC do you know in your new hometown, anyways? My dating / social / sex life are already screwed up enough *here* as it is, and geographically I'm probably in one of the the best places to be... and let's just say I don't see things getting better in flyover states. I'm not anti-what you did, it's your choice, after all, but you're not everyone. I sincerely apologize if I'm coming off as blunt, but I'm just being realistic. I'm probably less likely to find someone of that specific type I mentioned earlier up there than down here.

Now, I sincerely apologize if I'm rambling incoherently because it's like 2 AM where I live. But I... okay, maybe ""hate""'s a bit strong of a word to describe my (and our shared) situation. But I *don't like* being here. I *don't like* any of this. And it's not like voting for the other color's going to magically improve anything - ""overnight"" or over the span of years alike. To address your main question, I'm not so much depressed as I am *disillusioned*, which might even be worse. And it's not just me, either. It's a fine privilege to be proud of, and a vast improvement over the other option (lol, as if there's only one other option?)... that's what everybody says."
1811fge,2,2023-11-22,Doing a maths paper instead of CompSci 101 for CompSci / IT Management? For 1st year,u/CudaNvrWong,universityofauckland,https://www.reddit.com/r/universityofauckland/comments/1811fge/doing_a_maths_paper_instead_of_compsci_101_for/,"Year 13 student, going for Bsc in CompSci / IT management. So far I have enrolled for 
 
S1
CompSci 101
CompSci 110
Physics 140
InfoSys 110

S2
CompSci 120
CompSci 130
InfoMgmt 192
Stats 101

(Not related but is this structure good should I flip any of those papers around to a different semester?)

However I’m thinking of changing CompSci 101 to a maths paper, but I’m a little unsure if I should. I already have strong coding knowledge as I did NCEA L1,2,3 Digital Programming getting Exellence in all the papers for all of those years, however I feel it was taught poorly in my school and it was mainly just alot of googling and in this year a lot of ChatGPT to build my programmes as teacher was useless, hence I enrolled for CompSci 101 just so I could get taught how to code properly the uni way. However I hear that CompSci 101 is for pretty much beginners who know nothing, and I don’t really want “too easy” of a paper if it’s not gonna benefit me that much in the long run as I want to get into AI and ML and all that complex CompSci Stuff. 

Hence where I am now. I’m thinking of doing a maths paper. I did NCEA Level 3 Calculus this year, getting high merits in the internals, and from just doing the Externals last week I’m most likely gonna get borderline achieve (Just passing) or maybe even some High Not Achieves for all those papers (Complex numbers, Intergration, Differentiation) hoping I should pass though. I do believe that I can do better in uni in getting better grades. 

What paper would you suggest for me to do. Ik the common option is maths 120/130 however would it be possible for me to do maths 108/162 as to me those don’t seem as intense 😂, and I tbh don’t really wanna do a pure maths Algebra or Calculus paper cause that just seems like to much effort if it’s not needed for the Degree, but if those are the only maths paper that is good/helpful for CompSci / Info Management then ig I will have to do it 😂

Also before you say “Do CompSci 101 in summer school” I don’t really wanna do summer school tbh. I want to enjoy my holiday 😭

Overall:
- Should I do a maths paper instead of CompSci 101 (knowing my situation written from above)
-  if “yes do maths” what maths paper should I do (read situation above) 
- Unrelated but if my structure for the papers I’m doing is all goods or should I switch up some papers that I’m doing to a different semester

181af8p,12,2023-11-22,Is this normal??,u/DeadlyJelly18,CollegeRant,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/181af8p/is_this_normal/,"Firstly some background. I'm in my first semester first year of uni so idk if this is common in other unis or not. I'm in informatics major on electromechanical and informatics faculty.

1. The school is accepting everyone without exception, if you have graduated high school, you're in. No enterance tests or anything.

The problem with this is that now you have great diversity in what prior education students had. You have students who didn't study IT or similar at all and students what are now starting their second degrees in same class. 

There are obviously some expectations about what knowledge you are supposed to have prior entering the university, but there is no filter for those who don't, so these people are entering the school hoping to somehow catch up but because it is university, and there is alot of stuff in first semester, catching up is almost impossible. 
I find that allowing this is cruel because you have plenty of young minds that are coming in with expectations only for their hopes to be crushed and to be thrown out after few months for not performing, and are left to waste a year of their youth doing nothing. (Because of the way our school system works here). Wouldn't it be better to have some filter for these people so they dont have to waste their and schools time and resources?

2. There are just shy of 2000 students in my faculty in my semester because of that, the problem is only about 200 will be accepted into second semester in this major. So drastic majority won't have space to continue their studies.

And because only those with best grades can continue, you are left to compete with people that have plenty more experience and knowledge. You can be above average student and won't be able to go on because there won't be space for you.

Now keep in mind this is not some top of the line school. This uni doesn't rank among top schools in the city, country, nor continent, even if you only list IT schools. There is no reason for this school to be this competitive.

3. Another reason why it shouldn't be this competitive, is what does the school actually offer.(note: Now i know I'm only freshmen but I'm friends with some upperclassmen and they're telling me it's similar there too.) 

For example, as a student of informatics, my main subject is about algorithms and programming. Tell me why do I only have one 40 min video on YouTube per week about this subject? I have other classes like physics (partially chemistry too and i don't understand why informatics student has to learn either of these) that i have scheduled  twice per week each time for 1,5 hours long seminars. Does this make any Sense?? What's even worse is that i have the most homework from that class and the knowledge i need to complete them is barely being introduced in classes?

 Programming isn't something you can find answers for in books or something, you need to actually understand it if you want to work with it. I'm getting 2-3 assignments per week from this subject and they're getting so advanced already that most classmates i talk to have to rely on chatGPT to complete them. Assignments are this advances while in those YouTube videos the professor is just scratch the surface of explaining user input (""hello <your name>"" type deal). It doesn't make sense for there o be such gap. 

And because they're trying to teach us through practice, i get barely any theoretical knowledge about programming.

And you have to be lucky to get a response from the professor in case you message them with a question. 

4. Oh and i forgot to mention, because there's is 2000 of us, we all have our classes through video call online :) so no space for questions or any collaboration with teachers or other students. 

I asked some upperclassmen and they said they haven't had it like this, they were present for their classes in school in smaller groups most of the time. (Except during covid shutdowns)

I also wasn't given an option to pick subjects not in which group i am. Which is also something upperclassmen had option for.

TLDR: the uni i attend is all over the place and feels cruel to the students with regards to the pace of teaching and assignments or what subjects students are made to study. On top of that all of it is online for some reason which is horrible with the amount of stuff to learn and communication with professors.

I feel like there is just no value provided from the school about why i actually went there and at this point I'm just questioning why I'm here and if i should change schools. So is this normal in other schools too?"

(I asked permission of TCSnowdream first)

I am from the UK and relocated to Thailand about ten years ago. Initially, I lived in Bangkok, where I managed an international school. This followed a period of working at another educational institute. As my daughter grew older, we decided to move to the Thai coast for a change of environment. I've focused on private tutoring since getting here and as Thailand is quite a popular destination, I've been teaching people from all corners of the globe.

When ChatGPT came out I was all over it. I've always lived technology even though I'm getting on a bit, and it wasn't long before I'd make some tools to make my life easier and also to allow my students to practice more using actual speech.

So recently ChatGPT released My GPTS, which allows regular folk to make any tools they want.

So I transferred the tool I made into one of those. I'm currently adding all the countries I taught, plus I'll continue to add countries as well.

Basically you need to be a ChatGPT+ subscriber, but after that it's free. You use the record button to manually record your speech or the headphones button to have dialogue (although I recommend the previous.

Speak about anything, for however long you're comfortable. The AI will give you feedback in your own language for how you did and an error to word ratio as a percentage. Like me, it focuses more on effective communication over grammatic perfection as that's often a massive barrier for learners. The aim is to allow students to practice freely, so they can make mistakes without being  judged. 

It's trained on notes I took over the years on students from different countries as I noticed trends in how they learned differently. 

Before chatgpt came along, I didn't have a minutes worth of experience in tech, building websites or anything like that. However, since diving deeply into GPT technology, I've become fascinated by what it can do. It's exciting to think about how it can further connect the world and break down language barriers.

There is no way to give feedback in the tool, but I would really love to hear from anyone who tries it. Any feedback would be fantastic.

One natural guess is that it is AlphaGo-style Monte Carlo Tree Search of the token trajectory. 🔎 It seems like a natural next step: Previously, papers like AlphaCode showed that even very naive brute force sampling in an LLM can get you huge improvements in competitive programming. The next logical step is to search the token tree in a more principled way. This particularly makes sense in settings like coding and math where there is an easy way to determine correctness. -> Indeed, Q* seems to be about solving Math problems 🧮""

""Anyone want to speculate on OpenAI’s secret Q* project? 

- Something similar to tree-of-thought with intermediate evaluation (like A*)? 

- Monte-Carlo Tree Search like forward roll-outs with LLM decoder and q-learning (like AlphaGo)?

- Maybe they meant Q-Bert, which combines LLMs and deep Q-learning

Before we get too excited, the academic community has been circling around these ideas for a while. There are a ton of papers in the last 6 months that could be said to combine some sort of tree-of-thought and graph search. Also some work on state-space RL and LLMs.""

https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/22/23973354/a-recent-openai-breakthrough-on-the-path-to-agi-has-caused-a-stir 

OpenAI spokesperson Lindsey Held Bolton refuted it:

""refuted that notion in a statement shared with The Verge: “Mira told employees what the media reports were about but she did not comment on the accuracy of the information.”""

https://www.wired.com/story/google-deepmind-demis-hassabis-chatgpt/ 

Google DeepMind's Gemini, that is currently the biggest rival with GPT4, which was delayed to the start of 2024, is also trying similar things: AlphaZero-based MCTS through chains of thought, according to Hassabis.

Demis Hassabis: ""At a high level you can think of Gemini as combining some of the strengths of AlphaGo-type systems with the amazing language capabilities of the large models. We also have some new innovations that are going to be pretty interesting.""

https://twitter.com/abacaj/status/1727494917356703829

Aligns with DeepMind Chief AGI scientist Shane Legg saying: ""To do really creative problem solving you need to start searching.""

https://twitter.com/iamgingertrash/status/1727482695356494132

""With Q*, OpenAI have likely solved planning/agentic behavior for small models. Scale this up to a very large model and you can start planning for increasingly abstract goals. It is a fundamental breakthrough that is the crux of agentic behavior. To solve problems effectively next token prediction is not enough. You need an internal monologue of sorts where you traverse a tree of possibilities using less compute before using compute to actually venture down a branch. Planning in this case refers to generating the tree and predicting the quickest path to solution""

My thoughts:

If this is true, and really a breakthrough, that might have caused the whole chaos: For true superintelligence you need flexibility and systematicity. Combining the machinery of general and narrow intelligence (I like the DeepMind's taxonomy of AGI https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.02462.pdf ) might be the path to both general and narrow superintelligence."

181xyx4,6,2023-11-23,I don't know if these will help anyone but they were a blessing for me.,u/ThePromptfather,ESL_Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/ESL_Teachers/comments/181xyx4/i_dont_know_if_these_will_help_anyone_but_they/,"Hi, I've been teaching in Asia for some time and when ChatGPT came out I decided to make some tools to make my life easier. I made a level checker, a speech analyser and a dialogue practice game. 

As you know different countries have different hang ups/linguistic challenges, so rather than make a one size fits all, I made them so that they were fine tuned to the cultural/language/societal difficulties each country faced, using notes I'd taken over the years. 

It didn't take a great deal of effort to make them tbh as I tinkered over a few months. There's lots of these things available now but not that focus on individual countries.

So far I've done China, Japan, Thailand, Russia, India (Hindi), Mexico.

They're completely free to use, although you do need a ChatGPT subscription, I'll make it available for the free version of GPT as soon as I figure out how. 

I made them so it will speak to them in their native language (you can override that by just asking for English) so that it's just focusing on them speaking, and I really pumped up the translation process and all my students were impressed at how natural it sounds.

It will ask them to talk about whatever they want, it asks about English goals etc to start and they press the record or headphones button to speak. It transcribes and analyses (it can't 'listen' like we do unfortunately just yet, so pronunciation it can't pick up on so well) for;

- grammar

- vocabulary 

- fluency

- cohesion/coherence 

It will only tell them the major errors unless the student asks for in-depth feedback and an error to word ratio score as a percentage. 

It focuses on effective communication over grammatic perfection and utilizes progress tracking so it will follow up and also will steer them to working on issues they're having.

It's a practise tool for them to use without pressure, they can use it before a meeting with a teacher/bank manager/hairdresser whoever, or just to go over things they need work on. 

Anyway, I thought I'd share them as I've had a lot from the community over the years on my main account, and wanted to give something back!

Here is the page with them on it:

If you have any feedback I would love to hear from you!

I made a language-learning & study tool: [DictionaryGPT](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-TXaJZtnSf-dictionarygpt). It is a multi-language dictionary that brings together the magic of ChatGPT and the wisdom of traditional dictionaries.

As a student myself, I understand how annoying it is to come across academic jargons when reading a paper, or how painful it is to memorize new vocabulary and grammar when learning a foreign language (sighs in French minor…).

ChatGPT and traditional dictionaries can help, but they either provide an overload of confusing information, or are not tailored to specific language-related questions.

My yoga class costs $2.75 (if paid per month) and $7.50 with a punch card.
2. A cold plunge in the river costs me nothing. I also acquired a bunch of friends who are willing to do it with me. A double bonus situation.
3. ChatGPT costs $20 per month. You can trick it into discussing your issues more willingly if you pretend to be a therapist who is asking about a client (that would be yourself) and the client's actual struggles. When talking from the client's point of view, ChatGPT will be sending you to a ""licensed therapist"", which is very annoying.
4. A massage can be included in the insurance or paid out of pocket, and it's a little pricey ($90+), but if you have a community college where there's a massage therapy program, the students in such programs need practice and you can sign up to ""help"" them and yourself 
5. Same with accupuncture, sometimes it can be community accupuncture that's either $5 or a sliding scale.
6. Book clubs cost nothing.
7. Library rooms to book for your interest-based meetings cost nothing.
8. Books are pretty affordable. Library books are free. Used books are cheaper and better for the planet.
9. Running costs nothing. Maybe just the price of a decent pair of sneakers. 
10. Volunteering costs nothing and is good for your mental health and for your community: museums, nature centers, schools, land trusts, wildlife rescues, animal shelters, theaters, cabarets, circuses etc etc all need volunteers.
11. Treating a coworker or a friend or a neighbor to a lunch will cost still less than a therapy session. And the talk can be as superficial or as deep as you both will find comfortable.
12. Inviting guests over for a dinner on a weekend is also less expensive than therapy.
13. Hot springs where I live are $25 per day. There are wild ones, those are free.
14. A hike in the woods is free. Snowshoeing or cross-country skiing is just the cost of the pass.
15. Watching a documentary is not very expensive, but can be very educational. Same with online courses, podcasts and audiobooks.
16. Writing down your thoughts is free.
17. Writing long thoughtful emails to your friends is free.
18. Chatting with people online is free.

182rm3u,1,2023-11-24,post in cmv within 4 days,u/BlackHoleEra_123,u_BlackHoleEra_123,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_BlackHoleEra_123/comments/182rm3u/post_in_cmv_within_4_days/,"I feel like my previous post concerning this was cheaply rebutted by pointing out the tone used in the text and using similar arguments found on Twitter/X that were easily debunked by context and professionals who knew what they were doing. There were 4 or 5 good talking points that find artists' faults BEFORE GenAI happened, but that's about it. Nothing else. There's also one guy that said I was angry over this issue—of course I'm angry, what reaction do you expect when I see artists being bashed and screwed over just because of the introduction of GenAI? Oh wait. It's the 'net. Typical.

Needless to say, I'm not impressed either. There's a lot more I could have done, putting in new issues to apathetic light, or closing holes in an argument like this. This issue is complex well enough that I can't focus on every talking point, and all I can do is rebut with what I have on my brain at the moment. But I came back, looked at my argument representing my view, and I ""upgraded"" it with some quoting and paraphrasing, bringing up things I didn't initially bring up, and refining what I did bring.

GenAI is still the same disgrace as it was, being used to replace artists and animators, scam innocent commissioners, confuse non-artists, its supporters radically defending it flaming, screwing over artists and saying phrases like ""Adapt or Die!"" to them, and don't get me started on the copyright violations, profiteering, and privacy breaches it does, due to how its algorithm gathers data and the way people use it.

The art world has never been in more turmoil because of this technology. Not only that, corpos are trying to lobby politicians to ensure that they can continue using their dangerous tech. Thank goodness for some politicians listening to our issues and workers' strikes concerning this immoral creation.

Because of the way GenAI advocates, or techbros as we call them, and artists just expressing their concerns, it will be very hard for me to listen to the side where GenAI is supported, and even harder, because I looked back, and the professionals just pointed out how terrible your arguments are. Every day, same old phrases. Some artists thought of the S word once this tech encroached onto creative industries. Some artists quit, which is really sad. It's also causing artists and writers to turn to GenAI simply because they saw its ""potential"", and so they start using it, actively defending it the same way techbros do. Per ""AaranTheArtist's"" words: ""I often run into people who say that GenAI software learns, understands, gets inspired, has beliefs, looks at artwork, reads articles. These kinds of ideas result from careless and unclear use of language."" And ""kortizart's"" words: ""A fun thing about generative AI discourse is when AI advocates claim aggrieved artists don’t know how the tech works. But when you ask AI advocates how it works, some anthropomorphized nonsense like “It 'learns' and is 'inspired' just like you!” always creeps up. It’s embarrassing."" This is how techbros defend their use of GenAI, anthropomizing it, which is just overall cringe.

Oh, if this is only about visual art, you're wrong. While StableDiff, NovelAI, and ChatGPT being one of the current dominant algorithms focusing on text2image and text2text generation, there's plans on making similar generation algorithms for music and animation.

If you're thinking of this: ""Oh, it's supposed to be a tool."" No it isn't. It never was actually. The tech was made by corporates without knowledge of the art world and made for profit. Why else would they lobby politicians other than wanting to continue using their generators without ethical vibe checks? Its purpose is to be a replacement, to replace artists. Thank goodness the politicians listened to the artists, and the tech finally being either ethically regulated, or banned. Call me a Luddite if you want, but at least the Luddites fought against automation and job exploitation by destroying all the spinning wheels and looms that were built to destroy their careers. It's why they're called ""elitist"" and their cause being framed as ""anti-technology"" by people, which are similar to what artists are called nowadays. The Luddites are also probably responsible as well for your works to have minimum wages and fair standards today. History, being written by winners, rewrote their story from a workers’ revolt fighting for fair treatment to a narrow-minded war against technological progress and technology itself.

Some people even refuse to pick up a pencil and whatever paper they have and draw, instead paying $40 for a monthly sub service to GenAI. That's enough to buy you what you NEED to make stuff. Instead you choose to blow it over an over-anthropomorphized algorithm with the intention of automating art, which is a mockery of art itself. But of course, you don't care, because ""you can't draw."" It's not hard. There's YouTube tutorials, which are very helpful. There's even FREE hour-long courses you can watch and take, but no, you'd rather pay an algo and type what you want to get a soulless image you'd stroke your ballsack to. ""Oh, but I don't have the time to draw!"" That's exactly the point. Art takes commitment, love, perseverance. It's a fundamental process that GenAI decides to spit on. The only part where art is ""democratized"" is when those dollar signs hit up. That word, democratized. Democratized. Sound familiar? Yeah, this word is used when cryptocurrency and NFTs hit mainstream media, two things that techbros love. Having photocopiers and counterfeiting machines in every house is ""democratizing"" money. ""B-but only the rich are really good at art!"" Maybe. But anyone can do art, rich or poor. You have absolutely no excuse for paying $40+ for GenAI and complaining art is expensive.

Don't compare this with the camera either. Photography is a wholly different medium than art. There's no ironclad evidence that artists were replaced by a damn flashing printing telescope, and even if it did, at least it took time and effort, which GenAI lacks. GenAI users comparing themselves to photographers is just as terrible to them as it is to artists. You technophiles adore progress without looking into how many ethical violations and dangers were in effect during technological... progress.

And I thought automation was supposed to help, not to harm? Automation is the antithesis of art itself. And let's not forget that since it's just an algorithm on steroids, it has a chance to bias and recommend rather than giving you what you want. Why else would their outputs change with the same prompt or give out images of a busty white woman no matter the words you type? And my favorite new reason is that GenAI and its users does not know what art fundamentals and principles are. Takes no skill, time, or patience which attract techbros that love to make a quick buck rather than appreciate well-crafted crafts. And I quote a Tweet by ""Pehdrigues"": ""another fun thing is that artists are actually trying hard to educate themselves on the technical aspects of it, being informed in a field so different from their own, the AI evangelists don't bother trying to understand how we learn art, our craft or even simpl\[e\] ethics."" And yet GenAI users still call themselves artists, as per ""BookSpotlight"" on Twitter: it's not art, it's a prompt in a program processed off other people's artworks. What exactly is an ""AI artist"" doing to make the final result? Absolutely nothing. The algorithm does it for you, and that algorithm is built off other's works. Art's fundamentals, anatomy, color, brushwork, perspective, and art's principles, creativity, time, effort, and messaging... GenAI crushes all these shiny diamonds. These traits are what makes art creative and unique, and excessive automation destroys those traits. And to anyone citing digital art as automation, at least that took a near-equal degree of skill, while GenAI has zero skill whatsoever. As per ""Kelly\_McKernan's"" Tweet, I say: ""The fundamentals of art and principles of design translate across all mediums, all disciplines of art. Skill is adaptive, and if you can draw digitally, you can draw traditionally, with a relatively minor adjustment in technique. GenAI requires no practice, skill, or ability.""

Let's talk ethics. According to various artists on Twitter, a generative algorithm is ethical and safe to use if:

The sources from where processed data was originally acquired is copyright-free, with consent, and compensation.

The algorithm respects privacy.

The algorithm recognizes the word ""no"".

The algorithm is not built with any malicious or problematic intention or motive such as copyright infringement, sudden layoffs for profit, no respect for consent...

Current GenAI violates all of said rules, and therefore, is unethical and built with intent to damage human condition. Per the words of Molly Crabapple in the LA Times: ""There is no ethical way to use the major AI image generators. All of them are trained on stolen images, and all of them are built for the purpose of deskilling, disempowering, and replacing real, human artists."" Speaking of ""deskilling,"" did you know that there is a potential for some of the students in schools to use or have used any one of the current GenAI programs? Oh yeah. I'm talking about dudes that cheat on their essays by using ChatGPT to write it all for them. One such case is a post on Reddit where a student's essay was found to use an ""AI language model"". Didn't even bother editing out the evidence. I'd like to say, because of this happening, some were caught, while others managed to get off easy, letting some even-more-incompetent idiots through our system compared to our slightly-less-incompetent selves back then.

I could go on and on about other things that are blatantly problematic, such as some early forms of GenAI using power equal to 550 tons of CO2 exhausted from power plants. But this is about art, not climate change, and judging by that statement, it's probably outdated at the moment.

In short and conclusion, GenAI is theft, Big Brother, and a terrible digital stalker. Built as a minter, not an art tool. Why else would they make this tech other than money and masturbation?

To artists, as per ""konjak's"" words on Twitter: ""Don't give in to AI. Your creativity is still you. Start now. Continue as you were. Whatever. It's for you, and we also have to wait longer than one year of panic to see how it pans out."" And as per my words, don't give up, keep doing what you love doing, and seek help when needed. To artists like Karla Ortiz, thanks for defending the creative industry.

To GenAI advocates: Teaching children that pressing a few buttons to get a generated image is an equivalent to learning how to draw is literally taking away the gift of art. You just want to replace artists for green strips of paper, treating them like freaks. Artists like Scott Christian Sava tolerated the tech you praised so much, using a generated image as a baseline and inspiration, and screwing over artists is how you repay them? Well guess what? You lose. You need us to make your generators work. You need them for DALL-E 2 to work. Know your place.

I would like to end this argument with this portion of a statement that is the definition of art: Art. Noun. ""The expression or application of human creative skill and imagination, typically in a visual form such as painting or sculpture, producing works to be appreciated primarily for their beauty or emotional power."" GenAI does not have that. GenAI damages that definition."

182zhb4,65,2023-11-24,What is your school doing to address AI?,u/actual-catlady,CanadianTeachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadianTeachers/comments/182zhb4/what_is_your_school_doing_to_address_ai/,"We used to have secure software that would lock a student's browser when typing an essay assignment (which wasn't perfect, but worked well enough overall), then the provincial government decided that wasn't necessary anymore, lol. So we've just been fuckin winging it. Students are turning in AI shit left and right, and even if we use multiple AI checkers, look at the doc edit history, and show students examples of how chatGPT spits out basically the same thing they turned in when I put the prompt in myself, they deny, deny, deny, and sometimes the parents get involved... ""how DARE you ACCUSE my child of using AI""... it's a fucking shit show and no one is doing anything about it, despite teachers BEGGING for solutions. 

Just curious to know if any other schools have found any success in mitigating AI. I am desperate lol.

And personally, it makes my blood fucking boil to waste my time marking a paragraph or a paper that wasn't written by a human. It feels so demeaning and like it's an insult to my intelligence and my education, which is part of why I'm so fucking angry about the whole situation and the lack of support we're receiving."
1833q4z,1,2023-11-24,SWE job future,u/temp_acct_918237,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1833q4z/swe_job_future/,"Let’s skip the debate on where AI will be in the next 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 years. 

For this exercise, let’s assume the latest shakeup at chatGPT is legit. 

(For those who don’t know, the CEO Sam Altman was shockingly ousted last weekend. It was revealed that his ousting had to deal with AI safeguards, specifically pertaining to a “major breakthrough” in AI called Q*, which has been rumored to be able to do math, which chatGPT previously couldn’t. It is said this breakthrough is at or nearing levels of AGI. Shockingly again, he was brought back aboard earlier this week in a complete 180 and they are getting rid of several board members)

Normally I’d think this “major breakthrough” was just another hype cycle. But the firing of a CEO, and then bringing him back within a couple of days, seems to indicate MAJOR disagreement within the company, which could potentially actually be due to a major breakthrough and disagreement on what to do about it). 

Regardless of if this is true or not, it has to make you feel uneasy if you are a student or newer member of the field. Even if the breakthrough isn’t as big as they claim, it’s hard to imagine major changes coming within the next handful of years due to the billions of dollars and top talent being poured into AI research. 

Do you feel like continuing to learn and put time into this field is a pointless pursuit? There is a very real possibility that within the next 10 years the number of employed SWEs will be drastically reduced (and wages via supply/demand). 

I’m starting to seriously consider going back to my union public transit job because it seems like everyone saying not to worry about AI are sticking their heads in the sand"
183b6f4,1,2023-11-24,Watched someone use ChatGPT on a quiz,u/Weary_Sundae_3411,uvic,https://www.reddit.com/r/uvic/comments/183b6f4/watched_someone_use_chatgpt_on_a_quiz/," During a recent lecture for PSYC100A I watched another student open up a weekly timed quiz and proceed to copy each question into the GrammarlyGO AI model, which appeared to produce the correct answer for nearly all the questions that I saw.

Do I have an ethical mandate to report this to the teacher? Quizzes are open-book, and worth 1.5% of our term grade. In my mind they are mainly used as aids for memorization and understanding of material for our tests, which are not open book. A large part of me thinks that using ChatGPT in this case is actually a disadvantage since it prevents actual consolidation of knowledge from these quizzes, but at the same time its clearly unfair for (I hope) the majority of students and a violation of academic integrity. 

Am I just being a naive, overly-sensitive snitch here, or should I report this? Is ChatGPT being used widely and I am just unaware of it? "

### Educators Strike Back?

How are teachers supposed to respond to this?  I think there are two possible responses to this.  One is the first, very understandable response, which is to attempt to catch the “AI cheater” in the act.  This reaction makes sense at the moment since educational organizations have not yet had time to understand and respond to the technology.  To help on that front, we have created a thorough review of how educators might catch the students who decide to become AI cheaters in the article at this link.

### If You Can’t Beat’em…

However, in this article, we will look at what I believe is the second possible response educators can have to this technology: rather than trying to constantly stay ahead of this ever-evolving technology in order to try and “catch the cheater,” can we rather ask if there is a way of using generative AI as an educational asset?  Could we possibly view [machine learning](https://ai-solutions.pro/what-is-machine-learning-a-beginners-guide/) and [Natural Language Processing](https://ai-solutions.pro/what-is-natural-language-processing-nlp-the-ultimate-beginners-guide/) as a natural next step in the advancement of technology, much like math teachers eventually accepted the use of calculators in math class?""

183olhe,27,2023-11-25,Dear applicant…,u/Pitiful_Ad_5938,Internationalteachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Internationalteachers/comments/183olhe/dear_applicant/,"We all acknowledge that this is a stressful period in the life of any international educator seeking a move for the following year.

As much as you may not be qualified for 60% or more of the jobs you apply for, please remain strong. Here are some of the rejection responses you may receive from schools, don’t be discouraged or feel unqualified (if you are indeed qualified) by such, understand that some of the people in the HR positions are simply callous. 

GROUP 1: The rejection email is straight to the point. However, the sender is somewhat respectful.
1. We regret to inform you...
2. You have not been selected...

GROUP 2: The rejection email is a nice package of bad news. You feel okay though not okay after reading the entire thing. However, at least they act like humans. Just keep going, don’t stop applying. 
1. We'll keep your details on file...
2. This decision was a tough one...
3. Your application was impressive, but...
4. We appreciate your time...
5. Thank you for your interest….

GROUP 3: The rejection email is typed by some devil 👿 or robot “which” lacks the basic build of being human. 
1. You're not the right fit for this position... 
wow, and such a person spent 4 years in college to become a human resource manager or admin. Can a teacher say this to a student, supervisor or HR and they remain in their job?

2. Your qualifications don't suit our needs.
Yes, we know that at some point, a candidate may not have the required qualifications, but there is much more than just qualifications when applying for a job. Maybe try to be nice in your response. Some applicants spend over 2 hours on just one application. Please respect them by generating a simple yet nice response for all those you deem unqualified. ChatGPT is free and can help you with this. Everyone is trying to survive, don’t give people heart attacks.

3. The overall standard was high... 
so what? You mean the candidate is of “low” standard? What is high standard anyway? Simply because a candidate is not your type doesn’t mean that they are of low standard. Does high standard mean having advanced degrees, a certain number of years teaching in a particular environment, what do you exactly mean?. Be specific with candidates please if you want to use such strong language.

4. We're going in a different direction...
Yes, it is obvious that when you reject a candidate, you are moving away from them but look for a simple nice way to tell this to the candidates. These are the same things teachers are asked during interviews. “How do you deal with a student whom you feel is unfit to be in your class for various reasons such as behavior”. Imagine if a teacher responds by saying that they tell the student that “I am now moving in a new direction, I have given up on you”.

5. We've already filled the position...
How does this help the candidate? Do you really think about what goes through the mind of an applicant upon receiving a rejection email? What if this was their 50th application? Please be nice to them. Use ChatGPT if you don’t have time to create a professional rejection email.

6. There were a large number of candidates...
Yes, we know. Unless the school is a shitshow, we know that there is always a larger number of applicants. Please appreciate the applicant, tell them that you carefully looked at their application/documents (even if it maybe a lie), give some general credit to their application etc, then inform them of the bad news/decision. Once again ChatGPT can help with this. Lastly, wish them good luck.

We're moving forward with other applicants...
Okay, but at least appreciate the candidate’s effort to join your team. 

GROUP 6: The entitled ones. This group of schools don’t send anything to all those that didn’t make it. In their job descriptions, they make it clear how they are on top of the food chain and so receive a huge number of applications. They also claim how “technologically advanced” their school is, yet the HR department cannot compose a single nice rejection email to be sent to all the unsuccessful applicants. Please don’t feel hurt by such schools. Some of them are practically locked up in the days when they were started and that could be as back as 1930. They are the NOKIA type of schools. Very nice, reliable, and overall a good brand but backward. 

GROUP 7: These schools are usually run by the founders themselves oftentimes without any western training.  As soon as they receive an application, they immediately respond. If it’s a positive response, the candidate maybe fine with such a quick response. However, if it’s a rejection, it is not right/professional to send a rejection to a candidate 10 minutes after they have expressed interest. Emails can be scheduled, why not schedule an email to be sent the next day? An extremely quick response (under 1 hour), especially in October or November maybe a red flag no matter the nature (positive or negative) 

Whatever, the case, whenever you receive a rejection, gather even more energy to keep going. From the time I started teaching, I have always encouraged myself to apply to all opportunities available, including the well known extremedy competitive schools. It helps you to build extremely competitive supporting documents such as cover letters and resumes. Some of the job descriptions from the top end schools is enough to guide you on how to write a competitive cover letter or resume. 

GOOD LUCK IN YOUR SEARCH."
183pfj9,1,2023-11-25,Directed questions on koans and the Gateless Barrier with zen student ChatGPT,u/chadpills,zen,https://www.reddit.com/r/zen/comments/183pfj9/directed_questions_on_koans_and_the_gateless/,"Let’s talk about gateless gate, use all translations of Wumen Guan, the original Chinese text 無門關, and Gateless Gate as your source. Do not use any other sources 

What is the gateless barrier?

ChatGPT: The ""Gateless Barrier"" (Wumen Guan) is a collection of Zen koans compiled by the Chinese Zen master Wumen Huikai. It is referred to as ""gateless"" because the koans are designed to transcend ordinary dualistic thinking and lead practitioners directly to a non-conceptual realization. The term ""barrier"" suggests a challenge or obstacle that practitioners must confront, emphasizing the transformative nature of working with these koans in Zen practice.

What is enlightenment? 

ChatGPT: In the context of the Gateless Gate (無門關), enlightenment is often portrayed as a direct, experiential realization that transcends ordinary conceptual understanding. It involves perceiving one's true nature beyond the limitations of dualistic thinking. The Gateless Gate uses koans to guide practitioners toward this profound understanding, emphasizing direct experience over intellectual comprehension.

Enlightenment, as depicted in the Gateless Gate, is not a conceptual achievement but a transformative realization that goes beyond words and concepts.

What occurs during this transformative realization? 

ChatGPT: In the transformative realization depicted in the Gateless Gate (無門關), practitioners experience a profound shift in their understanding. This shift goes beyond intellectual comprehension and involves a direct, experiential realization of one's true nature. The specifics of this realization are often ineffable, challenging to express in words.

During this transformative realization, practitioners may experience a dissolution of dualistic thinking. It could be a moment of clarity, where the barriers of conventional understanding are transcended. The Gateless Gate, through its use of koans, aims to catalyze and guide individuals through this transformative process, highlighting the direct, non-conceptual nature of the enlightenment experience.

How do koans catalyze this transformative realization? 

ChatGPT: Koans, as employed in the Gateless Gate (無門關), catalyze transformative realizations by disrupting habitual thought patterns and challenging conventional understanding. Koans are paradoxical or enigmatic statements that defy logical interpretation, creating a sense of perplexity or doubt in the practitioner's mind.

Through contemplating and engaging with a koan, a practitioner is encouraged to move beyond ordinary dualistic thinking and intellectual analysis. The inherent contradictions or illogical nature of the koan create a cognitive dissonance that can't be resolved through conventional reasoning. This state of unresolved tension serves to break down conceptual barriers and open the mind to a direct, non-conceptual experience.

The process of grappling with a koan can lead to a breakthrough, where the practitioner transcends ordinary modes of thought and directly perceives the truth that lies beyond linguistic and conceptual limitations. In this way, koans in the Gateless Gate act as catalysts for transformative realizations, guiding practitioners toward a direct, experiential understanding of enlightenment.

What advice would Wumen give for catalyzing a transformative realization? 

ChatGPT: Wumen, through the Gateless Gate (無門關), would advise practitioners to engage deeply with koans and to approach them with a mind that is open, receptive, and free from preconceptions. The essence of Wumen's teaching lies in direct experience rather than intellectual understanding. Therefore, he might encourage practitioners to go beyond analytical thinking and conceptual reasoning when confronted with a koan.

Wumen might suggest approaching a koan with a sense of doubt or perplexity, allowing the mind to dwell in the uncertainty created by the paradoxical nature of the koan. By immersing oneself fully in the inquiry without trying to resolve it through ordinary reasoning, practitioners may create the conditions for a breakthrough.

Additionally, Wumen might emphasize the importance of perseverance and patience in the face of the challenges presented by koans. The transformative realization often comes when the mind, confronted with the limitations of its usual patterns, opens up to a direct, non-conceptual experience.

In essence, Wumen's advice would likely revolve around a direct, experiential engagement with koans, encouraging practitioners to transcend ordinary thinking and directly perceive the truth beyond words and concepts.

What advice would Wumen NOT give for catalyzing a transformative realization?

ChatGPT: Wumen, based on the teachings in the Gateless Gate, would not advocate for a purely intellectual or analytical approach. He would likely discourage practitioners from seeking answers solely through conceptual reasoning or relying on scholarly understanding. The emphasis in the Gateless Gate is on direct experience beyond words and concepts.

Wumen would likely caution against treating the koans as mere puzzles to be solved through intellectual cleverness. Instead, he would discourage a superficial engagement and encourage practitioners to approach the koans with a sense of doubt and openness, allowing the inherent paradoxes to penetrate deeply into their consciousness.

In essence, Wumen would not endorse a rigid, dogmatic, or formulaic approach to working with the koans, as the transformative realization is meant to arise from a more profound, intuitive, and experiential understanding.

…

Discussion topics: 

1. Is the above good advice in how to read, approach, and reflect on the Gateless Barrier (無門關)? 

2. What other advice would be good for zen students who are interested in reading and studying the Gateless Barrier (無門關)? 

3. How is the approach of Wumen Huikai different from the approach of Huangbo Xiyun?"
183wl7y,1,2023-11-25,Craft your own way through college,u/JohnstonChesterfield,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/183wl7y/craft_your_own_way_through_college/,"I graduated recently. I’ve been asked by a lot of people what I would do differently if I were to go back and have yet to find an answer I’m happy with. 

I’m part of a bunch of student communities on Reddit. And a consistent thing I see popping up are students having challenges finding motivation. It’s sad to see so many students struggling to find passion for the material they study. School and learning can be amazing, but often we way we’re told to engage with it - work hard, focus, go to the library - can be draining and soul-sucking. 

I’m posting here to remind you to think out of the box. To craft your own learning practice. I spent way to many painful hours crammed in the library. Wondering why other students found so much more joy in the process than I did. Wondering if I even belonged there.   


The way you learn is just as creative, and just as unique, as any other part of you.   


If I were to go back to college now I would think more about how I learn and what I need to make that process a reality. I love stories, world-building, and character evolution. Think Pokemon, Avatar Last Air Bender, Dragon Ball Z. etc.  Even with work, I turn things into characters moving through worlds to arrive at a story I can step into.   


Here are tools I use to elevate my learning process and self-growth at work and that I wish I could have had when I was in college:

1. [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/auth/login): I use GPT as an easy way to explore new angles on ideas I'm working out. Get new perspectives and explore concepts through frameworks I'm used to: Explain quantum physics to me like it's an anime world
2. [Reflect](https://reflect.app/): A note-taking app that connects pieces using Ai so that it's easier to grow a web of understanding versus silos that you have to manage. This is great if you write a lot and don't want to manage a messy folder
3. S[pacebar](https://reflect.app/): A new interface for voice content that lets you turn meetings, conversations, lectures, podcasts, etc into a chat interface and memory you can do anything with.   


Stay curious out there and always look for new ways to approach learning 🚀"

It is widely held that studying economics makes you more selfish and politically conservative. We use a difference-in-differences strategy to disentangle the causal impact of economics education from selection effects. We estimate the effect of four different intermediate microeconomics courses on students’ experimentally elicited social preferences and beliefs about others, and policy opinions. We find no discernible effect of studying economics (whatever the course content) on self-interest or beliefs about others’ self-interest. Results on policy preferences also point to little effect, except that economics may make students somewhat less opposed to highly restrictive immigration policies.

That is from [a newly published paper](https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/soej.12672) by Daniele Girardi, Sai Madhurika Mamunuru, Simon D. Halliday, and Samuel Bowles.  This is a good example of a myth that got started with relatively little basis in fact.  At the very least it now has to be filed under “unconfirmed, likely false.”  Via [Stefan Schubert](https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://twitter.com/StefanFSchubert).

**Character Name:** Aisha İlkhan  
**Gender:** Female

https://preview.redd.it/0lfiuzulhq2c1.png?width=2160&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a094214576bf0721a4a11f077b027cbff1e67e0

She wears a pair of traditional green-colored boots, a red shalwar with tulip motives on the stacks, a short-sleeve orange jacket with white sheets over the light green shirt. She has reddish-brown hair and blue eyes.

## Bio

Aisha is the daughter of a pro-wrestler mother and a judoka father. Her family's past is filled with fairness, respect and tolerance. Thanks to them, she grew up as a likable child. In her spare times, she took lessons in pro-wrestling and judo, and improved her skills, ready to join the tournaments.

Her first tournament instead came from Liu Kang’s visit to the Earthrealm. He saw Aisha’s potential and asked her if she’s eager to join the said tournament. She in turn asked Liu if there’s another female Earthrealm grappler which Liu shook his head in disappointment. Determined to represent herself as the first Earthrealmer female grappler, she accepted his invitation. 

## Alternate Costumes

* Mamma di Colosseo: Based on Angela Belti in Power Instrict
* Twin Eiffel: An outfit based on Manon in Street Fighter 6 and Shermie’s hairstyle in the KOF series (sans the frontal hair)
* Furious Kutie: Based on Tsugumi Sendo with Terry’s hat in Fatal Fury: Wild Ambition

## Unique Gear

* Red Singlet
* Green gi
* Sandals

## Entrance Animations

**Offense:** Aisha knocks the opponent back with a drop kick and after they do their own pose, Aisha delivers “In this kombat, you’re not expected to survive!” while pointing her index finger at them and doing a double thumbsdown hand gesture.

**Defense:** She points her index finger at the opponent and shouts “You'll be unable to get back up after this kombat!""

## Character Victory Pose

She makes a victory pose a la Zangief’s perfect KO win pose in Street Fighter 6, but unlike Zangief, she lifts her face up and roars loudly like a lion.

## Kameo Victory Pose

She makes Sonya Blade’s famous Y-shaped win pose in the first Mortal Kombat game. Except she lifts her head up and smiles.

## Special Moves

**Sun Spider’s Quarry:** She delivers a jumping kick to the opponent. If it connects, she grabs the opponent’s neck and drives them down.

**Earthquake Smash:** Aisha grabs her opponent by the neck, then quickly turns around and slams them into the ground five times in quick seccession.

**Mergen’s Knowledge:** She gets into a defensive stance to parry her opponent’s close range attack. If she successfully parries, she jumps up and delivers a strong front kick to the opponent’s face, launching them backwards.

**The Conqueror’s Blade:** Aisha grabs the opponent and kicks them four times. She then wraps them over her shoulder and throws them down.

**Attack at Sunrise:** She runs forward and wraps her arm around the opponent’s neck, then delivers a high spin kick on their face.

## Throws

**Urtica Thorns:** She grabs the opponent by their arm and throws them over her shoulder.

**Lycodon Coils:** Aisha grabs the opponent’s arm and swings them to the opposite side while sweeping her leg to trip them up.

## Fatal Blow

**Nape Breaker:** She holds the opponent down puts them in a chokehold a la Guillotine Choke, but attempts to break their nape thrice with the last attempt being succeeded, twisting their neck. She then tosses them to the opposite side.

## Fatalities

**Blackened Heartbreak:** She grabs her opponent and launches into the sky. She then spins rapidly as if to bring them onto her back while performing a foot sweep to slam them head-first, dismembering their head. She gently puts her opponent’s headless body down and bows her head towards the screen.

**Millenium Driver:** Aisha runs up to the opponent and places her head between their legs. She then leaps up, flips her opponent upside down, places her feet on the underside of their arms, and drives them into the canvas, dismembering their upper arms from the shoulder and their head. She sits on her knees and breathes deeply with her eyes closed.

## Brutalities

**The Last Ride:** Aisha grabs her opponent by their legs and lifts them up to perform an elevated powerbomb. The opponent has their backs of the skull smashed, splitting blood over the head.

**Tail End Dislocator:** Aisha puts her head under the opponent's shoulder and lifts them up and then sharply drops their groin on her knee, causing their skeleton (the upper arms, shoulders, torso and skull are shown) to come outta their body. She then sits the opponent on their knee.

## Brutality Victory Pose

**Brutality Victory Pose 1:** Aisha puts two index fingers up in the air and cheers loudly.

**Brutality Victory Pose 2:** Aisha flexes her arms to do a tough pose as she turns her head and winks at the screen.

### Brutality Victory Quotes

* That’s the power of a grappler!
* It’s my principle. Unless you hit me, I don’t hit you.
* Thinking about you in the kombats won’t give you back to me.
* Anything but the kombat is a lie!

## Stationary Taunts

* She flexes her arms while looking toward the fallen opponent.
* She bends her one knee and bows before the fallen opponent.

### Stationary Taunt Quotes

* Nothing is impossible. Not if you learn how to grapple.
* May Koca Yusuf be blessed forever./Well fought, fellow kombatant. (only in the second stationary taunt)

## Walkaway Taunt

She walks away while pointing her index finger at her before getting into fighting stance.

### Walkaway Taunt Quotes

* Respect to the grapplers!

### VS. Liu Kang

Liu Kang: Isn’t Jax the closest to being a grappler?  
Aisha: No, only if he has a full-on grappling moveset, he can be considered such person.

Liu Kang: You’re one of the few who knows my chronokinesis well.

### VS. Raiden

### VS. Reptile

Reptile: Ever fought my previous self?

Reptile: It’ll be my pleasure. Because my heart hurts when we talk about them.

### VS. Shang Tsung

Shang Tsung: Your soul will be mine.  
Aisha: Unless I'll claim yours first!

Shang Tsung: He didn't just do that, but also disguised himself as Kronika.

### VS. Kitana

Kitana: Is there something in your mind?

### VS. Mileena

Mileena: **\*playfully\*** You’ll be covered with blood.  
Aisha: **\*to herself\*** Why did the trio interrupt your treatment?

Aisha: Let’s see if we can develop a permanent cure.

### VS. Kung Lao

### VS. Smoke

Smoke: When there's smoke, there's fire.

Smoke: At least his pyromancer brother stood by my side.

### VS. Baraka

Baraka: You look like you're used to seeing the likes of me.

### VS. Rain

Rain: All will be lost in time...  
Aisha: Like tears in the rain.

Aisha: You got some water for me?  
Rain: I'll only use my power for the greater good but for you, I'll make an exception.

### VS. Sindel

Sindel: Feeling joyful to see me?  
Aisha: Joyful? I'm glad you're still the sane Sindel.

Aisha: Your previous self during Kronika's days was nothing but a b\*\*\*\* who could lose her virgin-  
Sindel: Ahem! I get it, alright? No need to be a foulmouth.

### VS. Tanya

Tanya: The first female grappler from the Earthrealm.  
Aisha: And the different version of Tanya I'm seeing right now.

Aisha: Some “fans” found your face ugly.  
Tanya: I’ll shove it up their groin!

### VS. Reiko

Reiko: Scared of the war?  
Aisha: Scared of not being fair!

Aisha: This warmongering won't satisfy at all.  
Reiko: If it won't, your agonizing death will!

### VS. Kenshi

Kenshi: Do not feel upset for me, Aisha.  
Aisha: But the loss of your sight like that is worse than what Shang did.

Aisha: What Mileena did was repulsive!  
Kenshi: She was not herself because of the Tarkat virus.

### VS. Li Mei

Li Mei: You wear different, yet your color palette stays the same.  
Aisha: At least I didn't change that much.

Aisha: You wore less before, Liu Kang gave you modesty?  
Li Mei: Boon and Tobias did it, not him.

### VS. Nitara

Nitara: Mmm, so fresh, so warm.  
Aisha: You will not suck another innocent blood!

Aisha: Begone! You don’t belong to this kombat, vile creature!  
Nitara: So what does that make you?

### VS. Ashrah

Ashrah: Do I look good with my hat or without it?  
Aisha: Don't ask me at all. I get confused in such topics.

Aisha: Actually, scratch what I said. You look good with your hat.  
Ashrah: I knew you'd say this, but in truth, I missed wearing that hat.

### VS. Geras

Geras: Glad you survived both Shinnok and Kronika's chaos.  
Aisha: At least I'm still the grappler you saw.

Aisha: I thought Shang's existence ceased.  
Geras: We all thought so. Turns out he was a Titan all along.

### VS. General Shao

General Shao: Join me, Aisha. We'll guarantee you a conquest!  
Aisha: For a warmonger? Hardly.

Aisha: I wish there would be a good counterpart of you.  
General Shao: The word ""good"" will soon be irrevelant.

### VS. Havik

Havik: Join our realm, let your inner chaos flow like a river!  
Aisha: And I’ll die by that eternal curse? Pass on this!

Aisha: You're not Havik I've heard of.  
Havik: \*laughs maniacally\* That's right. I'm Dairou this time!

### Mirror Match

Aisha 1: The greatest start to fight is against herself.  
Aisha 2: Hence the “mirror match”.

Aisha 2: Is it just me or am I seeing another female grappler?  
Aisha 1: No, just seeing your other self.

## Test Your Might

She balls her fists into one big fist and strikes downward. If successful, she flexes her arms and shouts “A grappling victory!”, similar to Zangief’s win pose in Street Fighter II.

## Ending Narration

**Aisha (narrating):** It was so good to be back to the tournament as a full-on grappler. Even though Jax is the closest to being such fighter. But... \*sigh\* this tournament deserves more grapplers like me. First encounter during Shao's invasion was thrilling, but the second was darker... Shinnok almost razed the Earthrealm to the ground... until Cage family and their friends ended up triumphant. Just as we thought that it'd be over, the scariest and the most frightening being arrived on the stage: Kronika. She was paranoid with her perfection on all timelines. But I never believed her. Kronika and her goal went straight to Gehenna. After the defeat she deserved, both Liu Kang and Shang Tsung ended up triumphant in ther last fight. In the end, I was reborn as the same person before Kronika showed up. And in this tournament, I'll make my dream come true: A fighting community that consists of the brand new but full-on grapplers. They surely deserve a wide recognition. They surely... deserve to be treated fairly and humanely.

## Kameo Fighter Info

**Species:** Shokan  
**Debut Appearance and Date:** Mortal Kombat 3 (1995)

## Kameo Intro Animation

## Kameo Fatal Blow

**Slam Dance:** Sheeva stomps the ground causing the opponent to go in the air and land in front of her face first, as they lay on the ground, she tramples their back, crushing their spine, ribs, and organs. She then slams the opponent behind her.

## Kameo Brutality

**Devastating Dragon:** Sheeva performs her Throw (Forward), continuing to beat the opponent's back with her lower hands until their lower body comes off.

## Kameo Fatality

**Stripped Down:** Grabbing a handful of flesh in each of her four fists, Sheeva pulls the opponent's skin away in two pieces, in an upward motion. She then kicks the opponent's skinless body away.

Here's my MK fan character Aisha's Mortal Kombat 1 version. In this version, she wears the modest outfit. Of course, I included her MK9 clothes as the unique set. In the conversation with JCVD, she and Jean make a reference to the Turkish movie in 2006 ""Sınav"". Jean Claude Van Damme played as Levent Lemi's close friend in that movie."

So basically what I've done is expanded on all the ways one can earn extra money in the UK, and also separated them by category. This list is based on my own experience of using various online sites and methods to supplement my own income over the past years, and I'm hoping that it will be relevant and helpful to many people in this community.

As always, the best advice for someone who needs more income is probably to get a job or to work towards a promotion, however, these things can also take quite a long time to achieve.

This list is for people who are looking for ways to supplement their income right now, and who would benefit from having a little extra each month to tide them over until their situation improves.

Anyway, Here is the list:

# Testing:

**(1) Usertesting:**

With this site, you test out the usability of apps and websites and get paid for it. Many of the tests only take 10 minutes and pay around £8.50 per, which is really good. Of course, you won't qualify for every test you apply to, but even if you apply to 10 and only qualify for 1, you're still going to be earning around £8.50 for that half hour of your time, as it only takes a minute or two to apply for each test. There are also longer tests you can apply for, which pay much more.

Your work consists of interacting with 'prototype' or ‘in production’ websites or mobile apps while speaking out loud to share your thoughts, emotions, criticisms, and suggestions. For the longer tests, you will sometimes have to video call with someone while you are completing the user test, which may sound a little offputting at first, but you'll find that this actually makes the hour go much faster than if you were doing an hour of shorter tests.

**(2) Userlytics:**

Like with Usertesting, you are getting paid for your feedback as you test out the usability of apps and websites. Again, you will have to have your microphone (and sometimes video) enabled while you share your impressions of the video, website, prototype, app, etc. that you are testing.

This site also pays quite well for the time you need to put in per test. Typically, the shorter tests pay around £4-£8, while longer tests can pay up to around £70, though qualifying for these is not a common occurrence in my experience.

It's important to note, that with this site and all testing sites, different people will qualify for different tests based on the answers they give in the screeners, which determine if you are a suitable candidate for the test you're applying for. With this in mind, my advice is to stay determined and keep applying, because you never really know when you'll be the perfect candidate for a test, and sometimes the test you're a perfect fit for will be one of the highest paying.

**(3) Intellizoom:**

This site is very similar to the others in that you are being paid for your feedback.It contains ""Think out Loud"" studies which require you to talk as you complete various tasks. Like with the other testing sites, what you earn will depend on what studies you're a match for. This site doesn't have quite as high an earning potential as other testing sites, with studies that require you to record video and audio usually paying around £8.50, and standard studies paying around £1.50.

**(4) Testingtime:**

Again, with Testingtime, you're being compensated for testing apps, websites and other products.  Your value as a tester comes from the fact that you're helping to influence the development of future products and services.

**(5) Utest:**

This isn't a site I see mentioned too often. It's essentially the same as the others in that you'll be matched with testing projects based on the information you've entered on your profile. The majority of projects involve functional testing, where testers use an app or website and look out for bugs and issues.

# 

# Projects & Tasks:

**(1) Teemwork:**

A crowd-sourcing site where you can complete various jobs and tasks. There is a great variety of jobs available, with tasks such as translation, evaluation, and video/audio collection showing up frequently. It would take a long time to list the all various tasks that appear on this site, as there really is a varied amount of work available on a daily basis.

This site pays very well for the time you put in, with many tasks paying £25-£30 for less than an hour of your time. When you first sign up, you may not see a huge amount of jobs available, but I would recommend checking back as often as you can, as some days there is a lot more available work than others. This site also pays out to Paypal.

**(2) Appen:**

This is a site where you can apply to work on various projects online, including social media evaluation, translation, data collection, surveys, paid conversation and many more. The rate of pay is very competitive, with some jobs paying up to £20 per hour. Most jobs pay around £11-£15 per hour (which is still great for online work) and I have not found it difficult to qualify for projects.

The potential earnings from this site over the course of a year can easily enter the £100s or even £1000s, so if it's not on your radar it really should be.

Apply for as many projects/tasks as you can, it's well worth taking the time to apply because even if you get one project, that can be hours of work at a great hourly rate.

**(3) Clickworker:**

Like others listed, Clickworker is a 'task for pay' site. Very similar to Neevo in that the tasks you perform are used to help train AI.

There's a decent variety of tasks available, my favourite being voice recordings of various sentences and phrases. There are also many tasks that revolve around taking photos of random things. The payment is fast and reliable and uses Paypal, never had any problems with these guys.

My advice is to get onto the UHRS section of the site to earn more money, there's a banner at the top of your jobs section which you can click to qualify for UHRS. You'll need to do a sort of exam to qualify, but it's mostly just a test of your English comprehension skills as far as I remember.

**(4) Neevo:**

Companies submit projects to Neevo to help improve their AI systems. When you’re a match for a project, you’ll be asked to complete a set of simple tasks, which could be in the form of text, audio, images or even video.

It's a straightforward 'task for pay' site. They payout through Paypal and the variety of jobs is good. I check this site every now and then, I know it's a smaller earner so I don't like to give it too much of my time. My advice would be to keep your eyes peeled for higher paying jobs that come along, Some of the lower paying tasks aren't really worth it for the time you need to put in.

# 

# Studies & Research:

**(1) Prolific:**

This is definitely one of the top paid study sites around. With Prolific you get paid cash for engaging in the research of Academics and Universities from around the world. There are Surveys and studies about scientific research, new products and public opinion. From minutes to hours, to multipart studies over longer periods, there's a respectable range of studies to participate in.

This site pays out to Paypal, it has a range of interesting surveys, and studies pay a minimum of £6.50 per hour. Each study or survey tells you the amount you'll be paid for completing the task and also gives you the hourly rate of said task, which is very useful.

If you compare Prolific to other Study/Research sites, like Respondent or User interviews, for example, you might at first notice that the pay per task is much lower. However, what sets Prolific apart from sites with higher paying studies is the frequency with which you'll receive tasks. I often leave the Prolific tab open while I'm working on something else, and it's not unusual to receive 5-6 short studies over a 2-3 hour time period. The advantage here is that you'll receive tasks based on the information you've entered on your profile, whereas on other paid research sites, you would be applying for higher paying tasks with screeners, but it may not be often that you get accepted for the studies you apply for.

**(2) Respondent:**

I'm sure some of you have heard about Respondent, It's a site where you get paid for taking part in various studies. The studies can be both remote and in-person but these days most of the available studies are remote.

It doesn't take long to apply to studies so even if you don't qualify, you haven't wasted too much time. Also, the pay is excellent when you do qualify, with studies generally paying between £10-£150, depending on the type of study and the amount of time it takes (Generally ranges from 15-90 minutes).

It's not really a site that you can depend on for frequent payouts, but even if you land a few studies that pay £60 or £70 each, you're doing very well for the time you put in, so I do think this one is worth checking every day if you have 5 minutes to spare.

**(3) User Interviews:**

User Interviews is a site where you get paid to take part in various studies. There are normally a lot of studies available to apply for and the screeners are usually short and sweet.

This one has a high earning potential, due to the vast variety of study topics offered on the site. If you check your homepage frequently enough, it won't be long before you find a study that is looking for an applicant with your background/interests. Studies can pay anywhere from around £8-£200.

**(4) Grapevine Panel:**

A market research site where you get paid for your input as you participate in group discussions and one-to-one interviews. You'll be notified by email when projects become available and it pays quite well for the time you put in.

**(5) Dscout:**

So with this site you are rewarded for helping with Market Research. The way this works is that you are given ""missions"" where you offer your opinions/feedback on various products or services in exchange for payment.

The Pay is good and the payout is received promptly through PayPal. I also like that you answer photo and video questions, it keeps me a bit more engaged.

Although the pay per task is reasonable, I wouldn't say that the frequency of available tasks is its strong point. Check as often as you can for available missions and apply for all of them. It may take a little bit of time to get your first mission but once you do, more and more will appear.

**(6) Angelfish Opinions:**

Another market research site where you get paid to take part in focus groups and surveys. Pays £1-£100 per task.

**(7) People for Research:**

Get paid to take part in market research. This site pays very well, with many projects offering £40-£80 per hour.

**(8) Focus Force:**

A research group that pays for your opinions and various products and services.

**(9) Focus 4 People:**

Get paid up to £150 for your participation in various research projects.

# 

# Surveys:

**(1) Qmee:**

A site/app where you get paid to help influence products and services by completing surveys.One of the stand-out advantages of Qmee is that you can cash out whenever you like, from as little as 1p, and it also pays out to Paypal.

There is usually a decent amount of surveys available, and for a paid survey site, the pay is relatively good.

**(2) Attapoll:**

An app where you get paid for answering surveys.

The surveys have a star rating so you can see which ones are most popular amongst users. The payout is fast and I find myself using this app more and more when I'm doing idle things like taking the train or on lunch break.

You can cash out to Paypal once you have earned £3. As with the majority of paid surveys, you're certainly not going to earn a fortune, but if work is scarce on some of the higher earning sites, then it's always good to have these types of tasks as a safety.

**(3) Lifepoints:**

Another reliable Survey site, You share your opinions on numerous products and brands and get paid for it.

There's a nice variety of surveys available every month and at certain points throughout the year larger surveys appear which pay quite well, it's just a matter of checking your jobs page often enough to catch these. Also Pays out through Paypal.

My advice would be to be patient. Some days it may seem that there are very few surveys available, but check back the next day and there could be much more after appearing.

&#x200B;

# Matched Betting:

This one is quite a unique means to make extra money in a short period of time, It's called Matched Betting. It's a very simple process but it's imperative that you read the Guides in full before you begin.

Matched Betting is where you use bookmaker sites to complete various 'Free Bet' offers (e.g Bet £10, Get £30 in Free bets), but the whole idea behind the process is that every time you ""make a bet"", you match that same bet on the exchange (meaning the value of your qualifying bet will always be returned to you).

So for example, if I bet £10 for Real Madrid **to Win** on the Bookmaker Site at odds of 2.5, I then also make a Matched bet on the Exchange (This is a separate site such as Smarkets or Betfair) where I bet for Real Madrid **not to win** at odds of 2.5 (or as close as I can get to those odds). In this way, I am covered in all outcomes (win, lose or draw), and it allows me to fulfil the requirements of the bookmaker's offer (e.g Bet £10 and get £30 in Free bets). The money from my initial bet has now been returned to me and I also have a £30 free bet credited to my account.

When I receive my £30 free bet, It's the same process of matching again but this time using my free bet on the bookmaker site. This is where I secure a profit, because I'm not using 'real money', and even if I lose on the bookmaker site, I will be paid out on the exchange.

This one is great if you can spare some money to get started. Your money isn't 'invested' or 'tied up' in anything, It's just that you'll need cash in order to complete the various free bet offers. You can withdraw your money at any time, but most people leave £100-£200 in their accounts just because it's easier than depositing money every time you want to do an offer. Over the course of 30 days, that £100-£200 or so will grow to £600-£700.

The main advantage of Matched Betting is that it really doesn't take a lot of time to hit that £500 profit mark. Over a 4 week period, I worked my way down through the list of welcome offers, nice and handy, and having completed 20 offers at 15 minutes per offer, I came out at £470 for 5 hours total of work.

Not to knock paid projects/survey sites, but if you don't have the time or desire to invest in that kind of online work, the obvious advantage with Matched betting is speed and simplicity.

NOTE: If you have a history with gambling, do not come near Matched Betting. Matched Betting is not gambling, but the fact you will be using betting websites to facilitate a profit is too much of a temptation- It's not worth it.

# 

# Transcription:

**(1) Rev:**

With Rev, you'll be paid to transcribe speech in audio and video files. If you're unfamiliar with this type of work, all it is is converting speech into text, like creating subtitles for a video, for example.

As a Transcriptionist, you can earn around 20-90p per audio/video minute. As a Captioner, you can earn around 40-90p per audio/video minute. If you also know a foreign language, then you can earn even more. This site pays out to Paypal weekly.

**(2) Way With Words:**

This is another popular transcription site. You'll earn around 35p-£1.50 per audio minute, depending on the project, and you'll be paid into your bank account monthly.

# 

# Content Moderation:

**(1) Modsquad:**

This is a site where you get paid to moderate content and help manage various online communities. The upside of this type of work is that it's flexible and you can choose projects that align with your own interests and knowledge.

The amount you earn depends on what kind of project you're working on and what skills you have. If it sounds like something you might be interested in, then all you need to get started is a computer, an internet connection, and a phone.

**(2) Crisp Thinking:**

With Crisp Thinking, the type of work you're applying for is something known as a 'Risk Analyst Contractor'. I know, it sounds like a very niche type of job, but in fact, it is content moderation just like Mod squad.

Essentially your role is to identify risks in online content. You can apply for this project by joining the waiting list on Crisp Thinking, found at the bottom of the 'careers' page, reading: 'If you wish to apply for freelance moderation work, find out more here'

I have read that this work pays very well, which is why there is usually a waiting list, but if it sounds like something you could see yourself doing in your spare time, then you might as well apply and hope for the best.

# 

# Freelancing:

**(1) Fiverr:**

Offer your services as a Freelancer and get paid. You can earn a lot from the ""gigs"" you post, but you'll need to have some kind of service you can offer that people will pay for. I'd recommend taking a look at what other people are posting and seeing if you could offer similar work.

You'll need to think of some kind of service that you can charge money for, but this can be just about anything. This also means that there's unlimited earning potential because you're creating your own work.

**(2)  Freelancer:**

Another great site where you can offer your services as a Freelancer. You can post projects offering whatever category of skill you possess, be it ghostwriting, programming, data entry, or blogging. If you have a service to offer, then you can get paid for it on this site.

Like with Fiverr, I would recommend taking a look at the home page of the site to see what kind of services other users are offering. This will likely give you some ideas of the type of projects you could post, because even if you don't think you have a skill you could charge money for, you probably do.

**(3) People Per Hour:**

I like this one because you can send proposals to complete a certain task. For example, you might see a post where someone wants a person to write social media posts or proofread a piece of work.

There's always a good variety of jobs available, and the more you build up your profile, the more work you'll get.

**(4) Guru:**

Another popular freelancing site. Essentially the same as Fiverr or Freelancer.

# 

# Selling/Renting:

**(1) Vinted:**

This is a great Site/App where you can sell your old clothes. Maybe it doesn’t sound like your thing or you don’t think you have anything fashionable enough to sell. Believe me, You can sell any item of clothing here.

I’ve sold clothes here in the past and have been pleasantly surprised with a nice few sales. The process of signing up and getting started selling is very easy, and the items of clothing you list will likely receive attention even if you aren’t a top seller.

**(2) Facebook Marketplace:**

Sell your old stuff. This one should honestly be mentioned in every thread where someone has asked how to make some extra cash in a hurry.

We all have stuff we don't use anymore lying around the house and as obvious as it may sound, the items that seem old and worthless to you will be new and exciting to someone else.I'm talking anything, literally anything: Old clothes, books, plant pots, gadgets you don't use anymore, furniture, homemade crafts etc.

Old Clothes seem to really sell fast, which isn't surprising because people get excited when they see something that's their style and really cheap. So clear out your wardrobe.

If you're into crafts, you could sell stuff you've made there too. The point is, You could easily make £50-£100 or more if you do a thorough sweep of your house for stuff you don't want/use anymore.

**(3) Fat Llama:**

This is a site where you can rent out pretty much anything. I first discovered it when I was trying to find a cheap place to rent some tools.

You can browse the site and see what kind of things other people are renting out, you'd be surprised by the number of items in your own home that you might not have use for but others would be happy to rent from you for the day.

# 

# Something Different:

**(1) Rover:**

This one is quite a great site where you can offer your services as a dog sitter/dog walker. You can have dogs dropped off at your home and get paid to look after them for a duration of time.It's ideal for people who miss having pets or who get a bit lonely working from home, etc. The pay is usually around £20 per day for dog sitting, maybe £6-£10 for dog walking. If you're at a loose end anyway or just feel like having a furry companion during your free time, This site is a nice way to earn a little money and make some canine friends.

You just make a profile and enter your address so people in your area can find you, Bonus points if you have a dog in your profile photo with you.

**(2) My Tutor:**

MyTutor is an online-tutoring site, I don’t see this site mentioned a whole lot but it really is a gem. This one is ideal for students and recent graduates, but if you have skills or knowledge in any teachable subject then you should check it out. You don’t need any previous experience as a tutor to work here.

You can earn up to £20 per hour and the work is rewarding and meaningful because you are helping others to learn. It’s also very “social” online work, which some people may see as a nice change.

Also, If you like the idea of tutoring but don't have knowledge in any of the teachable subjects listed on My Tutor, There is also the option of teaching ESL, which you can do a quick TEFL course on and may be worth the investment if you think you'd be interested in that type of work. It can be quite a good earner too. You can do these classes freelance or work for an online company such as Preply or Hallo.

&#x200B;

# Bank Switching:

Bank switching has become quite well known on the sub, but understandably a lot of people are hesitant to try it out because it seems like too much effort or because it may affect their credit score.

I have done a few bank switches in the past year, and was pleasantly surprised by how easy they were. It's essentially free money for what usually amounts to less than an hour of your time.

The only thing I would say is that if you're applying for a mortgage soon, it is probably best to give these a miss, as they may affect your credit score.

With that said, Bank switching is a great way to earn a decent amount of extra cash (Up to £850), and you can actually earn more from these switch offers if you sign up through cashback sites, so you should check if there is a cashback offer available on Topcashack, Quidco, etc. before completing each switch.

**Note:** Below are short summaries of the requirements for each bank switch, however, you should go to the wesbite of each bank mentioned below and read the full details of each switch before you complete it.

&#x200B;

**(1) Nationwide: £200**

Complete a full switch to a FlexPlus, FlexDirect or FlexAccount and switch two direct debits to receive £200 to your bank account. You can easily set up direct debits such as Paypal and OnePounddd to meet the requirements of this offer. You'll receive the £200 within 10 days of the switch completing.

**(2) Halifax: £250**

Complete a full switch to either the Rewards Current Account or Ultimate Rewards Current Account and receive £250. No direct debits required.

**(3) Co-op Bank: £125**

Switch to Co-op Bank through a refer a friend link, Set up 2 direct debits, Deposit £800, Make 5 card payments and register for online banking. Then complete an online form with your details ( name, switch date and account number) and you'll receive £125 to your account.

**(4) Barclays: £175**

Download the Barclays app and open a bank account. Once open, join Blue Rewards in app. Then, go to the Products section of the app and select account switch. You will need to switch an account with two active direct debits. You will receive £175 to your account within 2 weeks of starting the switch.

**(5) First Direct Switch: £175**

Switch an existing bank account to First Direct, Pay £1000 into the account within 3 months of switching, and Receive £175 to your account. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

That's all that I can think of right now for this list. I hope this post is of help to some people and if you have any questions about anything I mentioned just ask and I'll do my best to answer.

Thanks for reading."

* **Timeline of OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman’s Shocking Ouster**  
Everything that happened since OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman was abruptly removed from his role:  
\- Friday, Nov 17:   
**Ilya Sutskever schedules Google meet with Altman**  
According to an X post from Brockman, OpenAI chief scientist Ilya Sutskever sent Sam Altman a message to schedule a meeting for Friday afternoon.   
**Brockman informed Altman was fired**  
Just after midday on Nov. 17, Brockman got a text from Sutskever asking him for a quick call. After joining the call a few minutes later, he was informed he was being removed from OpenAI’s board of directors but would maintain his role as president.  
**OpenAI publicly confirmed that Sam Altman has been fired**  
OpenAI published a blog post saying Altman had been fired due to not being “consistently active in his communications with the board”.  
**Microsoft issues statement on OpenAI**  
Microsoft is the largest investor and partner in OpenAI, has openly issued a statement keeping Altman’s ousting in mind, with CEO Satya Nadella.  
**Greg Brockman resigns**  
Considering the public announcement of Altman’s ouster, Greg Brockman announced his own resignation.  
**Increasing numbers of Resignations**  
After Greg Brockman’s resignation, many senior OpenAI executives resigned, with the company’s head of preparedness, Aleksander Madfry, and director of research, Jakub Pachocki.  
**- Saturday, Nov. 18:**  
**Altman will be back with a new AI venture**, Media company The Information reported on Nov. 18 that Altman had already started discussing a new AI-related venture with investors. Greg Brockman is expected to join Altman in whatever endeavor he moves forward with.  
**Microsoft is extremely upset about Altman's removal** and pressuring the board to bring him back as a CEO.  
**And the Board agrees to reconsider Sam Altman as CEO and Brockman as president**. But bringing him back may require the board to issue an apology as well as a statement that frees him of wrongdoing, sources told Bloomberg.

* **Microsoft Research explains why Hallucination is necessary in LLMs!**  
\- Microsoft Research + 4 others have explored that there is a statistical reason behind these hallucinations, unrelated to the model architecture or data quality. For arbitrary facts that cannot be verified from the training data, hallucination is necessary for language models that satisfy a statistical calibration condition. However, the analysis suggests that pretraining does not lead to hallucinations on facts that appear more than once in the training data or on systematic facts. Different architectures and learning algorithms may help mitigate these types of hallucinations.

Imagine this: it's 11:30pm, and you are frantically trying to finish an essay due at midnight. In a bid to save time, you turn to AI tools like ChatGPT for help. Once you have the AI-generated essay, you find yourself painstakingly paraphrasing each line, hoping to make it undetectable, to pass it off as your own work. This process, often fraught with stress and uncertainty, has become a common practice in a world where AI writing tools are just a click away. But here’s the catch – as AI detectors become more advanced, simple paraphrasing is no longer enough. This is where undetectable AI steps in, revolutionizing how we approach AI-assisted writing. In this post, we delve into the limitations of paraphrasing AI-generated content and explore how undetectable AI is reshaping the future of academic writing, offering a smarter, more secure way to harness the power of AI for your essays. 

## How Students Paraphrase AI-Generated Content

Students often turn to AI-generated content to assist with their academic writing, but to avoid detection, they engage in paraphrasing. This involves altering the structure and wording of AI-generated text while maintaining the original meaning. Techniques include changing sentence structures, using synonyms, and reordering content segments. However, this approach is usually taken to bypass plagiarism checkers and AI detectors, assuming that superficial changes can mask the AI's involvement. Here's a closer look at how students typically paraphrase AI-generated content: 

### 1. Word Substitution

**Using Synonyms**: Students frequently replace words in the AI-generated text with synonyms. This technique changes the superficial layer of the text while keeping the underlying ideas intact.

**Altering Technical Terms**: For subject-specific content, students might substitute technical terms or jargon with more common language or vice versa. 

### 2. Sentence Structure Modification

**Reordering Sentences**: Changing the order of sentences within a paragraph to make the flow of ideas seem different.

**Combining or Splitting Sentences**: Students often combine short sentences into longer, more complex ones or break down long sentences into shorter ones. This alters the rhythm and structure of the text. 

### 3. Content Rearrangement

**Reorganizing Paragraphs**: Moving paragraphs or parts of the content around to create a different progression of ideas or arguments.

**Adding or Removing Sections**: Students might add their own insights or remove sections from the AI-generated content to give the impression of a different focus or analysis. 

### 4. Introduction and Conclusion Rewrite

**Personalizing the Opening and Closing**: Rewriting the introduction and conclusion is common, as these parts are crucial in reflecting a student's personal voice and perspective. 

### 5. Incorporating Personal Insights and Examples

**Adding Personal Anecdotes or Examples**: Students may insert their own experiences, examples, or insights, which can significantly change the nature of the content and make it appear more personalized. 

### Limitations and Challenges

While paraphrasing can modify the AI-generated text, it poses several challenges:

**Time-Consuming**: The process can be time-consuming and might not save as much effort as initially intended.

**Risk of Losing Original Meaning**: Excessive paraphrasing can lead to a loss of the original content’s meaning or coherence.

**Potential Ethical Issues**: There are ethical considerations, especially in academic settings, where passing off AI-generated content as one's own, even when paraphrased, can be considered dishonest. 

## Why Paraphrasing Won't Work Against AI Detectors

Advancements in AI detection tools have rendered simple paraphrasing ineffective. These detectors analyze writing patterns, including sentence structure, word choice, and even the subtleties of style that are unique to AI-generated content. Simply rewording or reordering sentences from AI-generated content is often insufficient to evade such advanced detection. As these tools become more sophisticated, they can identify underlying patterns indicative of AI, regardless of superficial changes made to the text. 

## What is Undetectable AI?

Undetectable AI refers to advanced artificial intelligence systems that generate content virtually indistinguishable from human-written text. These systems, like StealthGPT, use sophisticated algorithms and natural language processing techniques to mimic human writing styles accurately. The key feature of undetectable AI is its ability to produce content that can bypass even the most advanced AI detection tools, making it a revolutionary tool in fields that require original and authentic content. 

## How Undetectable AI Prevents AI Detection

Undetectable AI, such as StealthGPT, is designed to generate content that evades detection by AI detectors, which are tools used to identify AI-generated text. This capability is crucial, particularly in contexts where the authenticity of human authorship is important. Here’s how undetectable AI manages to prevent AI detection: 

### 1. Advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP):

**Human-Like Language Modeling**: Undetectable AI utilizes sophisticated NLP models trained on vast and diverse datasets. This training enables the AI to produce text that closely mimics human writing styles, including the nuances, variances, and complexities of natural language.

**Contextual Awareness and Adaptation**: The AI can contextually adapt its writing, ensuring that the content is not just grammatically correct but also contextually appropriate and stylistically varied, much like human-written text. 

### 2. Avoidance of Predictable Patterns:

**Randomization and Variation**: To evade detection, undetectable AI avoids repetitive linguistic patterns and predictable sentence structures, which are common markers used by AI detectors. It uses randomization techniques to vary word choice, sentence length, and syntax.

**Emulating Human Idiosyncrasies**: The AI includes idiosyncrasies typical of human writing, such as colloquialisms, idiomatic expressions, and even controlled imperfections, to replicate the organic feel of human writing. 

### 3. Continuous Learning and Updating:

**Adapting to Detection Algorithms**: Undetectable AI systems are continually updated to stay ahead of the latest AI detection algorithms. They are trained to recognize and adapt to new patterns that detectors use to identify AI-written content.

**Incorporating User Feedback**: User feedback and interactions help the AI to learn and evolve, further refining its ability to produce undetectable content. 

### 4. Sophisticated Content Structuring:

**Logical and Coherent Flow**: The AI ensures that the content is logically structured and coherent, mirroring the way humans organize and present information, which is a challenging aspect for many AI detectors to analyze.

**Customization and Personalization**:

**Tailoring Content to Specific Needs**: The ability to customize content based on specific user inputs (like writing style, tone, or specific points to cover) makes it harder for detectors to identify a consistent AI fingerprint across different pieces of text generated by the AI. 

### Practical Example

For instance, when a university student uses StealthGPT to write an essay on a historical topic, the AI not only provides well-researched content but also presents it with varied sentence structures, personalized style adjustments, and a logical flow of arguments, making the essay indistinguishable from one written by a human. 

## Conclusion

The era of simply paraphrasing AI-generated content to bypass detection is becoming obsolete with the rise of advanced AI detectors. The future lies in undetectable AI, which offers a sophisticated solution to the challenges of authentic content creation. As we embrace undetectable AI, the focus shifts from evading detection to enhancing creativity and efficiency, ensuring the integrity and originality of AI-assisted writing in various academic and professional contexts. 

## StealthGPT: A Smarter Alternative to Paraphrasing AI Content

As a student in the digital age, where the boundaries of technology and academics constantly blur, it's time to rethink how you approach essay writing. Instead of spending hours paraphrasing AI-generated content, with uncertain results and the looming risk of detection, why not turn to StealthGPT? This undetectable AI platform is revolutionizing the way students create essays, offering a seamless, efficient, and most importantly, undetectable solution to your writing needs. With StealthGPT, you get the advantage of high-quality, original content tailored to your specific requirements, all while maintaining the authenticity of human-like writing.

The importance of international collaboration and cooperation  
Quantum computing is an emerging field of technology that has the potential to revolutionize how we solve complex problems that are beyond the capabilities of classical computers. The race to develop practical quantum computers is heating up, and many countries are investing heavily in research and development to gain a competitive advantage. In this context, international collaboration and cooperation are becoming increasingly important as a means to accelerate progress and achieve breakthroughs.  
The Importance of Collaboration  
Quantum computing is an interdisciplinary field that requires expertise in physics, computer science, mathematics, and engineering. No single country or organization can claim to have all the necessary skills and resources to develop practical quantum computers. Therefore, collaboration and cooperation are essential to leverage the strengths of different countries and organizations and to overcome the challenges associated with developing quantum technologies.  
Collaboration can take many forms, such as sharing knowledge, expertise, and infrastructure, coordinating research efforts, and jointly funding projects. For example, the European Union's Quantum Flagship program is a collaborative effort involving 12 countries and over 5,000 researchers with the goal of developing a quantum computer by 2025. Similarly, the US National Quantum Initiative Act of 2018 aims to establish a coordinated federal program to accelerate the development of quantum technologies.  
Collaboration can also help to address some of the ethical and societal challenges associated with quantum technologies, such as cybersecurity, privacy, and the impact on the job market. These challenges are not limited to a single country or region and require a global perspective and cooperation.  
The Benefits of Collaboration  
Collaboration can bring many benefits to the development of quantum technologies. Firstly, it can accelerate progress by avoiding duplication of efforts and leveraging the strengths of different countries and organizations. For example, a country may have expertise in quantum algorithms, while another may have expertise in quantum hardware. By collaborating, they can combine their strengths to develop a practical quantum computer faster than if they worked independently.  
Secondly, collaboration can enhance the quality of research by enabling researchers to access a wider range of resources, including data, infrastructure, and expertise. This can lead to breakthroughs that may not have been possible otherwise.  
Thirdly, collaboration can help to establish common standards and protocols, which are essential for the development of a global quantum computing ecosystem. This can ensure interoperability between different quantum computing platforms and facilitate the development of applications and services.  
Finally, collaboration can help to foster trust and goodwill among countries and organizations. Quantum technologies have the potential to transform many industries, including finance, healthcare, and transportation. By collaborating, countries and organizations can share in the benefits of quantum technologies and promote economic growth and prosperity.  
Challenges to Collaboration  
Despite the benefits of collaboration, there are also challenges that must be overcome. One of the biggest challenges is the need to balance national interests with the common goal of developing practical quantum technologies. Countries may have different priorities and agendas, which can make collaboration difficult. For example, a country may be reluctant to share its expertise and resources if it perceives that it will not benefit from the collaboration.  
Another challenge is the need to protect intellectual property rights. Quantum technologies are highly valuable, and there is a risk that intellectual property may be misappropriated or stolen. Therefore, collaboration must be accompanied by measures to protect intellectual property rights and prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information.  
Finally, there is a need to ensure that collaboration is inclusive and equitable. Developing countries and underrepresented groups must be given equal opportunities to participate in the development of quantum technologies. This can help to avoid creating a technological divide and promote global cooperation and harmony.  
In conclusion, international collaboration and cooperation are essential for realizing the full potential of quantum computing. The field is highly complex and multidisciplinary, and requires expertise from a variety of domains. By sharing resources and expertise across international borders, researchers can accelerate the pace of discovery and development in the field. Moreover, international collaboration in quantum computing can have significant implications for national security and economic competitiveness, and can also help to promote scientific diplomacy and build bridges between countries. As such, it is crucial that countries work together to ensure that quantum computing is developed and leveraged for the benefit of all of humanity.  
Long-term investments in research and development  
The race for quantum computing supremacy has been heating up in recent years, with countries and private companies investing heavily in research and development (R&D) to gain an edge in this emerging technology. The potential benefits of quantum computing are vast, from advancing fields like medicine and finance to revolutionizing cybersecurity and even transforming the way we think about computing itself. In this context, it's no surprise that governments and businesses around the world are pouring resources into this cutting-edge field.  
One of the most high-profile efforts to win the quantum computing race is the US National Quantum Initiative Act, which was signed into law in 2018. This legislation provides $1.2 billion in funding over five years to support quantum research and development efforts across government, academia, and industry. The initiative aims to establish a national strategy for advancing quantum computing and related technologies, with a focus on developing a quantum workforce and infrastructure to support this effort.  
Other countries have also been ramping up their investments in quantum computing R&D. China, for example, has set ambitious goals for becoming a world leader in quantum computing by 2030, with a $10 billion investment in research and development over the next decade. The European Union has also launched a major quantum research initiative, with a goal of developing a full-scale, quantum-based communication network by 2030. And Canada has been investing heavily in quantum research and development, with a focus on developing quantum technology for practical applications.  
In addition to government investments, private companies are also pouring resources into quantum computing R&D. Tech giants like IBM, Microsoft, Google, and Intel have all launched major quantum computing initiatives, with the goal of developing practical quantum computers and related technologies. Venture capital firms are also investing in quantum startups, with a focus on developing commercial applications of this emerging technology.  
Despite these investments, however, the race for quantum computing supremacy is far from over. There are still many technical challenges to overcome before practical quantum computers become a reality, and it's not yet clear which countries or companies will ultimately emerge as leaders in this field. In addition, there are concerns about the potential risks posed by quantum computing, particularly in the area of cybersecurity, where quantum computers could potentially break current encryption methods.  
To address these challenges and risks, collaboration and cooperation between countries and companies will be essential. The global nature of quantum computing research means that no single country or company can dominate this field alone, and international collaboration will be key to advancing the science and ensuring the safe and responsible development of this technology.  
One example of this collaboration is the creation of the Quantum Economic Development Consortium (QEDC) in the US, which brings together government agencies, industry, and academia to develop a national strategy for advancing quantum technology. The QEDC is focused on promoting collaboration and knowledge-sharing among its members, with the goal of accelerating the development and commercialization of quantum technologies.  
Similarly, the European Union's Quantum Flagship program is aimed at fostering collaboration and cooperation among researchers and industry partners across Europe.

The public sector, on the other hand, can provide the necessary funding, research facilities, and regulatory framework to support the growth of the industry.  
One strategy for collaboration between the private and public sectors is to establish public-private partnerships (PPPs). These partnerships bring together the strengths of both sectors and facilitate the transfer of technology and knowledge between them. In the context of quantum computing, PPPs can help accelerate the development and commercialization of quantum hardware, software, and applications.  
PPPs can take various forms, including research collaborations, joint ventures, and technology transfer agreements. For example, research collaborations can bring together researchers from academia, industry, and government to work on fundamental scientific questions related to quantum computing. Joint ventures can enable private companies to partner with government agencies to develop and commercialize quantum technologies. Technology transfer agreements can facilitate the transfer of intellectual property from public institutions to private companies for commercialization.  
Another strategy for collaboration between the private and public sectors is to establish innovation hubs and centers of excellence. These facilities can provide a platform for collaboration, innovation, and commercialization of quantum technologies. Innovation hubs can bring together researchers, entrepreneurs, investors, and policymakers to create a vibrant ecosystem for quantum computing. Centers of excellence can provide the necessary research infrastructure, funding, and expertise to support the development of quantum technologies.  
Innovation hubs and centers of excellence can be established at various levels, including national, regional, and local.

I am attending my last last last choice university, I applied to about 50 colleges/universities due to being poor. And still had to go to the school that was my last backup due to financial aid.

I am miserable, I have always been miserable, I am a hard-of-hearing student and am attending a deaf University, It is like being back at high school, I have zero ambitions and am passing because most of it feels like common sense. I want to leave, I have wanted to for a long time, I have been attempting suicide since being a freshman here, from jumping out of the window from the 7th floor to the parking garage, to pills. I have been suicidal for as long as I can remember. I have no fucking clue what to do.

The work is not the issue it never really is, I have never really needed to put in much effort, I feel so stupid for not being able to say I've learned something or I actually tried. It is like everything is busy work and ChatGPT can solve it, It's as if my brain won't let me commit to trying to do hard work. I feel like everything I say is an excuse. The issue is I am a friendless piece of shit, who is depressed and cannot for the life of me focus or commit to anything I try to. I have always been this way and yet I can't change.

I have done medication, therapy, impatient, and yet nothing. but I can't confidently say I have tried putting in the work. I just feel numb, burnt out, whatever, just unable to keep trying to find a sliver of hope to continue. I have told my mom, and she's trying to help me try to make a decision, but should I even be making one? Like do I take a Leave of absence? Withdraw? or keep going until my inevitable end? I feel like I have zero rights to even seek help, change, or even try, I feel worthless and this is incoherent nonsense.

If I leave for a semester I do not know if I could actually change, but a part of me is like ""This would be the first time in my life without school for more than a summer, maybe just maybe I can do a 180 and get ""better"""" But that starts to feel stupid and too dream like.

My head feels like its never gotten past sixth grade, I feel like I have not formed new thoughts in such a long time, I am always repeating shit like, I'm an ugly piece of shit, I'm worthless, I'm a burden. Like nothing has been new. I don't know how to change, I have no discipline whatsoever.

Im 19, I don't fucking see anything changing for me, I see me continuing uni then moving back home, and never being able to not be this way. Who am I if im not depressed, anxious, so damn self critical? At some point isn't it just me? Like doesn't it all just become my personality?

I have only ever read everyone's post before, and this is my first time actually posting, I hope I can get some sort of guidance. Honestly don't expect any response, I am lost, and will probably commit sooner or later."

In today's episode, we'll cover rumors surrounding a groundbreaking AI called Q\*, OpenAI's leaked AI breakthrough called Q\* and DeepMind's similar project, the potential of AI replacing human jobs in tasks like wire sending, and a recommended book called ""AI Unraveled"" that answers frequently asked questions about artificial intelligence.

Rumors have been circulating about a groundbreaking AI known as Q\* (pronounced Q-Star), which is closely tied to a series of chaotic events that disrupted OpenAI following the sudden dismissal of their CEO, Sam Altman. In this discussion, we will explore the implications of Altman's firing, speculate on potential reasons behind it, and consider Microsoft's pursuit of a monopoly on highly efficient AI technologies.

To comprehend the significance of Q\*, it is essential to delve into the theory of combining Q-learning and A\* algorithms. Q\* is an AI that excels in grade-school mathematics without relying on external aids like Wolfram. This achievement is revolutionary and challenges common perceptions of AI as mere information repeaters and stochastic parrots. Q\* showcases iterative learning, intricate logic, and highly effective long-term strategizing, potentially paving the way for advancements in scientific research and breaking down previously insurmountable barriers.

Let's first understand A\* algorithms and Q-learning to grasp the context in which Q\* operates. A\* algorithms are powerful tools used to find the shortest path between two points in a graph or map while efficiently navigating obstacles. These algorithms excel at optimizing route planning when efficiency is crucial. In the case of chatbot AI, A\* algorithms are used to traverse complex information landscapes and locate the most relevant responses or solutions for user queries.

On the other hand, Q-learning involves providing the AI with a constantly expanding cheat sheet to help it make the best decisions based on past experiences. However, in complex scenarios with numerous states and actions, maintaining a large cheat sheet becomes impractical. Deep Q-learning addresses this challenge by utilizing neural networks to approximate the Q-value function, making it more efficient. Instead of a colossal Q-table, the network maps input states to action-Q-value pairs, providing a compact cheat sheet to navigate complex scenarios efficiently. This approach allows AI agents to choose actions using the Epsilon-Greedy approach, sometimes exploring randomly and sometimes relying on the best-known actions predicted by the networks. DQNs (Deep Q-networks) typically use two neural networks—the main and target networks—which periodically synchronize their weights, enhancing learning and stabilizing the overall process. This synchronization is crucial for achieving self-improvement, which is a remarkable feat. Additionally, the Bellman equation plays a role in updating weights using Experience replay, a sampling and training technique based on past actions, which allows the AI to learn in small batches without requiring training after every step.

Q\* represents more than a math prodigy; it signifies the potential to scale abstract goal navigation, enabling highly efficient, realistic, and logical planning for any query or goal. However, with such capabilities come challenges.

One challenge is web crawling and navigating complex websites. Just as a robot solving a maze may encounter convoluted pathways and dead ends, the web is labyrinthine and filled with myriad paths. While A\* algorithms aid in seeking the shortest path, intricate websites or information silos can confuse the AI, leading it astray. Furthermore, the speed of algorithm updates may lag behind the expansion of the web, potentially hindering the AI's ability to adapt promptly to changes in website structures or emerging information.

Another challenge arises in the application of Q-learning to high-dimensional data. The web contains various data types, from text to multimedia and interactive elements. Deep Q-learning struggles with high-dimensional data, where the number of features exceeds the number of observations. In such cases, if the AI encounters sites with complex structures or extensive multimedia content, efficiently processing such information becomes a significant challenge.

To address these issues, a delicate balance must be struck between optimizing pathfinding efficiency and adapting swiftly to the dynamic nature of the web. This balance ensures that users receive the most relevant and efficient solutions to their queries.

In conclusion, speculations surrounding Q\* and the Gemini models suggest that enabling AI to plan is a highly rewarding but risky endeavor. As we continue researching and developing these technologies, it is crucial to prioritize AI safety protocols and put guardrails in place. This precautionary approach prevents the potential for AI to turn against us. Are we on the brink of an AI paradigm shift, or are these rumors mere distractions? Share your thoughts and join in this evolving AI saga—a front-row seat to the future!

Please note that the information presented here is based on speculation sourced from various news articles, research, and rumors surrounding Q\*. Hence, it is advisable to approach this discussion with caution and consider it in light of further developments in the field.

How the Rumors about Q\* Started

There have been recent rumors surrounding a supposed AI breakthrough called Q\*, which allegedly involves a combination of Q-learning and A\*. These rumors were initially sparked when OpenAI, the renowned artificial intelligence research organization, accidentally leaked information about this groundbreaking development, specifically mentioning Q\*'s impressive ability to ace grade-school math. However, it is crucial to note that these rumors were subsequently refuted by OpenAI.

It is worth mentioning that DeepMind, another prominent player in the AI field, is also working on a similar project called Gemini. Gemina is based on AlphaGo-style Monte Carlo Tree Search and aims to scale up the capabilities of these algorithms. The scalability of such systems is crucial in planning for increasingly abstract goals and achieving agentic behavior. These concepts have been extensively discussed and explored within the academic community for some time.

The origin of the rumors can be traced back to a letter sent by several staff researchers at OpenAI to the organization's board of directors. The letter served as a warning highlighting the potential threat to humanity posed by a powerful AI discovery. This letter specifically referenced the supposed breakthrough known as Q\* (pronounced Q-Star) and its implications.

Mira Murati, a representative of OpenAI, confirmed that the letter regarding the AI breakthrough was directly responsible for the subsequent actions taken by the board. The new model, when provided with vast computing resources, demonstrated the ability to solve certain mathematical problems. Although it performed at the level of grade-school students in mathematics, the researchers' optimism about Q\*'s future success grew due to its proficiency in such tests.

A notable theory regarding the nature of OpenAI's alleged breakthrough is that Q\* may be related to Q-learning. One possibility is that Q\* represents the optimal solution of the Bellman equation. Another hypothesis suggests that Q\* could be a combination of the A\* algorithm and Q-learning. Additionally, some speculate that Q\* might involve AlphaGo-style Monte Carlo Tree Search of the token trajectory. This idea builds upon previous research, such as AlphaCode, which demonstrated significant improvements in competitive programming through brute-force sampling in an LLM (Language and Learning Model). These speculations lead many to believe that Q\* might be focused on solving math problems effectively.

Considering DeepMind's involvement, experts also draw parallels between their Gemini project and OpenAI's Q\*. Gemini aims to combine the strengths of AlphaGo-type systems, particularly in terms of language capabilities, with new innovations that are expected to be quite intriguing. Demis Hassabis, a prominent figure at DeepMind, stated that Gemini would utilize AlphaZero-based MCTS (Monte Carlo Tree Search) through chains of thought. This aligns with DeepMind Chief AGI scientist Shane Legg's perspective that starting a search is crucial for creative problem-solving.

It is important to note that amidst the excitement and speculation surrounding OpenAI's alleged breakthrough, the academic community has already extensively explored similar ideas. In the past six months alone, numerous papers have discussed the combination of tree-of-thought, graph search, state-space reinforcement learning, and LLMs (Language and Learning Models). This context reminds us that while Q\* might be a significant development, it is not entirely unprecedented.

OpenAI's spokesperson, Lindsey Held Bolton, has officially rebuked the rumors surrounding Q\*. In a statement provided to The Verge, Bolton clarified that Mira Murati only informed employees about the media reports regarding the situation and did not comment on the accuracy of the information.

In conclusion, rumors regarding OpenAI's Q\* project have generated significant interest and speculation. The alleged breakthrough combines concepts from Q-learning and A\*, potentially leading to advancements in solving math problems. Furthermore, DeepMind's Gemini project shares similarities with Q\*, aiming to integrate the strengths of AlphaGo-type systems with language capabilities. While the academic community has explored similar ideas extensively, the potential impact of Q\* and Gemini on planning for abstract goals and achieving agentic behavior remains an exciting prospect within the field of artificial intelligence.

In simple terms, long-range planning and multi-modal models together create an economic agent. Allow me to paint a scenario for you: Picture yourself working at a bank. A notification appears, asking what you are currently doing. You reply, ""sending a wire for a customer."" An AI system observes your actions, noting a path and policy for mimicking the process.

The next time you mention ""sending a wire for a customer,"" the AI system initiates the learned process. However, it may make a few errors, requiring your guidance to correct them. The AI system then repeats this learning process with all 500 individuals in your job role.

Within a week, it becomes capable of recognizing incoming emails, extracting relevant information, navigating to the wire sending window, completing the required information, and ultimately sending the wire.

This approach combines long-term planning, a reward system, and reinforcement learning policies, akin to Q\* A\* methods. If planning and reinforcing actions through a multi-modal AI prove successful, it is possible that jobs traditionally carried out by humans using keyboards could become obsolete within the span of 1 to 3 years.

I will try to be as detailed as possible but I'm literally just getting into using AI/code for the first time so apologies if what I say doesn't make sense to you! I'm a senior studying education and I have to fill out several very long unrealistic lesson plans a week using a specific template. I've gotten good at using chatgpt to create lessons that I like and it will give me a plain text document of the lesson plan information, but I'm not sure how to transfer the information to the format that I use without just copying and pasting which of course takes unnecessary time. I've looked into Zapier and tried to play around with the openai playground but despite using guides etc. I'm stuck. I put placeholders in my original template and asked chatgpt to make the information it gives me match up with those placeholders but honestly I don't even know what that means lol or how to use them. Advice? I'd even pay someone to do this for me lol but again broke college student. Thank you guys!!"
185obdf,1,2023-11-28,Am I being too picky/sensitive?,u/PeachyPesco,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/185obdf/am_i_being_too_pickysensitive/,"Relatively new teacher here. I've worked two long-term sub jobs in the past, one 6th grade gen ed and one resource room middle school math position. In both cases, the teachers quit mid-year because the behavior of the kids was so horrible. Yet through both of those jobs, I had a deep love of teaching and my students. Part of it was the confidence that I was doing my job well because my admin would occasionally thank me for me work, part of it is the constant compliments from the younger kids (even if the behavior was a lot worse), part of it is having curriculum I could base lessons off of, and part of it is the joy of loving and trying so hard for students who just weren't appreciated by their previous teachers.

I'm in my first permanent position now as a high school teacher and I feel so hopeless everyday.

My current situation is:

* I have 5 prep periods. I have no curriculum or materials left from previous teachers. 
* There are such a wide range of student abilities that it feels impossible to differentiate and it feels like I'm letting everyone down — around 1/3 of my students are new to the US and can't understand basic English, 1/3 seem to have learned helplessness and just lay on TikTok or sleep all period, and the last 1/3 finish early then seem disappointed that there's not more to do in the lesson. 
* There is no system for discipline, other teachers are confused when I ask about it. The only option seems to be calling down to the office in an emergency, there's nothing in place for smaller things like cell phone usage or work refusal. I don't want kids to be punished, I just want there to be SOME type of consequence or discussion from admin. But because there is no disciplinary system, students constantly ditch class, and I have students hanging out from other periods in my room with no accountability. There are students in my class with 30-40+ absences with no office follow-up.
* I have no copies of IEPs or 504 Plans. I keep asking for them but the SpEd department either says ""you should have them already"" (I don't) or ""don't worry about it"" (I am).
* There is an expectation that students should be able to make up work from ANY point in the semester, so it feels like I am constantly teaching 10 different lessons at once. (and I thought I was lenient with allowing things to be turned in up to a month late with no penalty...) 
* My manager sends me emails and requests for things written, I am not kidding, entirely by ChatGPT. 

When I try to talk to others at school about the problems I'm experiencing, I just get responses like ""Welcome to \[School Name\]!"" or ""This is a lot better than it used to be."" It's hard for me to remember why I wanted to do this career. I'm so new, is this normal? Was I just treated like a princess in my last couple jobs because I took a sub position nobody else wanted??"

I'm a student and me and my team have the assignment to make a chatbot for our university. We need to make a chatbot that can help other students find information about their course. We will get our data from manuals of multiple universtity websites (as pdf). This data will be turned into Q&A data using ChatGPT 4. 

However, we are struggling to find a pre-trained LLM that fits our assignment. We've researched T5, BERT and GPT-2 but our teacher was surprised those were the models we researched, since there are more popular and newer models. Our chatbot must be in Dutch, but we can translate so the LLM doesn't need to be trained on Dutch data. The LLM can't be too big, because we don't have the hardware for very large models.

We are currently looking at openchat and falcon, both with 7B parameters. Are these good options or does anyone have any tips for better LLMs?"

18645ye,2,2023-11-28,How to write an online exam that is harder to cheat on than write,u/talondarkx,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/18645ye/how_to_write_an_online_exam_that_is_harder_to/,"Hi everyone, 

I am planning an online exam for my online course. The course is on management and secondary research methods, and in the past the exam had multiple choice questions and asked students to read a few articles and summarize the different parts of the journal articles. It is a first year class, so we're just trying to establish fundamentals. ChatGPT is, unfortunately, excellent at all of this. My students are almost all international students whose primary way of interacting with education is 'try to cheat first, do it honestly second'. 

(Many of you will think, ""why are there even online courses available then to this student population? This is an excellent question! But the answer is 'because it's cheaper' for the 'university' that is in reality a bargain basement college in disguise.)

 I am trying to figure out what hurdles I can throw up to make cheating harder. I know I can't stop it, but I don't want students to be able to copy the exam into ChatGPT and get a passing grade without effort. I also don't want to have to submit 40 academic integrity reports if 40 out of 100 students submit obvious ChatGPT answers.

I have a few ideas:

1. Ask the students to hand-write their answers and upload pictures of their responses. (I'm aware they can simply copy from ChatGPT.)
2. Ask the students to annotate the journal article as they read through it and upload pictures of their annotations. (This seems like a pain in the ass to have to manage files when grading an exam.)

Neither of these seem great, and I have no idea how to write multiple choice questions on management that are cheat-proof. Has anyone had any ideas that have, in your experience, seen success?"
1866eub,1,2023-11-28,Analysis can make GPT worse at mathematical reasoning,u/PiranhaJAC,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1866eub/analysis_can_make_gpt_worse_at_mathematical/,"I gave ChatGPT-4 a version of the [Petersburg Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Petersburg_paradox). It correctly deduced that the equation for the expected value is:

> E=(1/2)×1+(1/4)×2+(1/8)×4+(1/16)×8+…

It then launched the Analysis tool, and wrote the following code:

> # Calculating the expected value of the series
> expected_value = sum([(1/2)**(n) * 2**(n-1) for n in range(1, 1000)])  # Large number for approximation
> expected_value
 
And confidently returned 499.5 as the answer. When I pointed out that the approach of finding an approximation by adding many terms is only valid for converging series, it then correctly inferred the divergence and gave a sound answer to the original riddle.

This is an illustrative error. ChatGPT behaved like a high-school maths student who has learned to use his scientific calculator and now everything remotely mathematical looks like a numeric equation to compute. It's perfectly within the mathematical reasoning abilities of GPT-4 to look at that E equation and see that it's an infinite divergent sum - I've verified this by giving it the same puzzle with Analysis turned off. But when tools are available it's over-eager to deploy its fancy computation toy, and it blindly believes the output without sense-checking."

Anno  Domini is proud to welcome the return of Céline Lyaudet from Nantes,  France to San Jose for her second solo exhibit “Language of the Birds.”   Since her successful debut exhibit “Map of the Path,” Lyaudet has  continued her exploration of the mystical and the hidden realms of the  psyche. The title and current works in this series refers to secret,  coded, and mystical language used in alchemy and poetry. Lyaudet draws  inspiration from nature, ancient civilizations, and the wisdom of  mystical artists; she infuses her creations with spirit, symbolism and  profound meaning. Her paintings are rich with pigments she crafts  herself incorporating natural materials (such as wood ash or clay) as  part of her image creating ritual. These very materials used imbue the  painting with its own unique magic and vibrations, embodying the spirit  within the physical matter of her art.

""Today is going to be fuckin great""  Bortusk Leer (Amsterdam) 

Since bursting onto the street art scene of East London in 2007 with his bright coloured characters painted on newspaper.  
His  work has appeared on and livened up numerous streets, gallery and home  walls in places all around the world. From all over Europe, Argentina,  the USA, India and Australia to name but a few.  
He is now living and working mainly in Amsterdam.

Fed up with people being angry, disappointed, sad and disillusioned with life,  
Leer sees it as his duty to brighten up the world and spread some happiness.  
Over  a decade Bortusk has developed a signature voice and style, creating  manic, euphoric creatures (his monsters) plus other lively abstract  pieces, videos, TV shows and numerous psychedelic assemblages of  Neo-Pop-Art-Brut.

Fascinated by the Cobra-movement, inspired by futuristic heroes and influenced by all the children of the world,   
His  aim is not only to create as much art as he possibly can, but also to  put a smile on everyone’s face and spread some positive emotions whilst  doing so.

Living as we do now in a world of division, suspicion, potential lockdowns and endless bad news.  
Bortusk looks beyond this, some say his mission is naive while others bless him for it.  
Leer  himself does not fear naivety, he fears cynicism. Loudly and gamesomely  Leer attempts to question our mental, social and political barriers.  
He tries to disrupt our fears and our expectations.  
Finally, his effervescent work challenges the inner child in us all to come out and play.

“I just want to cheer people up a bit, as there’s far too many miserable bastards out there!”  \~Bortusk Leer

ENVIANDO FLORES A MI TIERRA  
Featuring: Sofía Córdova, Delvin Lugo, Christian Rodriguez 

ENVIANDO  FLORES A MI TIERRA, loosely translated to “sending flowers back to my  homeland”, features the works of Sofía Córdova, Delvin Lugo, and  Christian Rodriguez. Honoring their origins while embracing the journey  of the Latino diaspora, all three artists capture similarly unique  stories about the transformative nature of immigration. What happens  when one leaves behind the familiar for the unknown? How does one choose  their new place of belonging? How do we continue to appreciate the  memory of what once was, while living through all that was left behind?

Performance by Batey Tamb  
Batey  Tambó, a women of color-led cultural group in Oakland and San  Francisco, is deeply rooted in the Afro-Indigenous Puerto Rican Bomba  tradition. Co-director Denise Solís, founder of the all-female ensemble  Las Bomberas de la Bahia, is a pioneer as one of the first women to play  the Subidor (lead drum) in Bomba. Julia Caridad Cepeda, also  co-director, comes from the esteemed Cepeda Family with an 8-generation  history in Bomba. Together, they lead Taller Bombalele Bomba Classes,  fostering the tradition in the Bay Area.

Batey  Tambó's mission is to engage in discussions on racial, gendered, and  geopolitical contexts through Bomba. This musical tradition, born from  the transatlantic slave trade, served as a tool for survival and  communication among freed Africans and indigenous peoples in Puerto  Rico. Batey Tambó, through Taller Bombalele, offers classes, workshops,  and performances to honor the diverse histories of the Latinx Diaspora,  promoting healing and liberation. ""La Bomba es Vida.

Heesoo Kwon, Leymusoom Garden: Following Naked Dancing and Long Dreaming 

In  her first solo museum exhibition, Leymusoom Garden: Following Naked  Dancing and Long Dreaming, Heesoo Kwon explores her spiritual journey  connecting Korean shamanistic and indigenous perspectives to the land  with her female ancestors. Her multimedia installation extends the queer  feminist utopian digital space of Leymusoom to the mysticism of the  garden, deepening her connection to the land and women’s freedom and  desire. 

Also on view:  
Adia Millett, Wisdom Keepers

Wisdom  Keepers, a solo exhibition by Adia Millett, explores the parallels and  interplay between a craftswoman and a warrior. In both cases “martial  arts” is an intricate set of techniques and skills used with the  intention of protecting, preserving, and building a community and its  culture. While the tools used in this process differ for the soldier and  the quilter, put side by side a shared story is revealed, providing a  new perspective of our ancestral past, and perhaps our future. Millett’s  new work is a response to an in-depth look at the African-American  quilt collection at the Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive  (BAMPFA). The four quilts on loan from BAMPFA present the viewer with a  foundation for which Millett’s lineage of fabric, formal composition,  and use of color palette derive from.

I thought that both the number (some courses had 4 exams) and the length of the exams (some of them were up to 3 hours) was excessive. However, now that I'm teaching, I see why. If you don't have exams, you can't be sure the students aren't cheating--whether it's copying from other students or using ChatGPT. Unless your coursework has some very specific technical questions that Google or ChatGPT won't be able to answer, chances are, at least some of them are cheating, especially students from certain countries where cheating is more widespread. 

Moreover, having exams prepares you for the world of work, where technical interviews are basically oral exams."
186nl43,1,2023-11-29,Demystifying the ChatGPT API: A Deep Dive into OpenAI's Powerful Language Model Integration,u/samsmithhh1,u_samsmithhh1,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_samsmithhh1/comments/186nl43/demystifying_the_chatgpt_api_a_deep_dive_into/,"In the ever-evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, the ChatGPT API has emerged as a game-changer, ushering in a new era of interactive and dynamic conversations. Developed by OpenAI, the ChatGPT API allows developers to integrate the power of ChatGPT into their applications, products, and services, opening up a myriad of possibilities for innovation and creativity.

## Understanding ChatGPT

Before delving into the API, let's take a moment to understand the foundation upon which it is built - ChatGPT. ChatGPT is a language model that belongs to the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) family, known for its ability to generate human-like text based on the input it receives. Trained on diverse and extensive datasets, ChatGPT is capable of understanding context, generating coherent responses, and simulating natural conversations.

The original ChatGPT was introduced as a research preview, allowing users to interact with the model on the OpenAI website. This provided valuable insights into its capabilities and limitations, paving the way for the development of the ChatGPT API.

[ChatGPT API](https://preview.redd.it/h69ygg3wy93c1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=23903f061ba875f3a7623dffa8d5ea2d48a88314)

## Introducing the ChatGPT API

The ChatGPT API takes the capabilities of ChatGPT to the next level by enabling seamless integration into third-party applications. This opens up a world of possibilities for developers, businesses, and individuals seeking to enhance their products and services with natural language understanding and generation.

### Key Features of the ChatGPT API

1. **Interactive Conversations:** One of the standout features of the ChatGPT API is its ability to engage in dynamic, back-and-forth conversations. Unlike traditional models that generate responses in isolation, ChatGPT excels in maintaining context over extended interactions. This makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, from chatbots to virtual assistants.
2. **Multi-Turn Conversations:** The API supports multi-turn conversations, allowing developers to pass a series of messages as input. Each message contains both the role (either ""system,"" ""user,"" or ""assistant"") and the content of the message. This facilitates a more natural and interactive flow of communication.
3. **System Level Instructions:** Developers can provide high-level instructions to guide the behavior of the model. By using system-level instructions, they can influence the tone, style, or specific aspects of the responses generated by ChatGPT. This level of control ensures that the AI aligns with the desired user experience.
4. **Flexible Integration:** The API is designed for ease of integration, supporting a variety of use cases. Whether it's powering a chat interface, automating content creation, or assisting users in complex tasks, the flexibility of the ChatGPT API makes it a versatile tool for developers.
5. **Token-Based Pricing:** The API follows a token-based pricing model, where users are billed based on the number of tokens processed. This allows for fine-grained control over costs and ensures that users only pay for the computational resources consumed during API interactions.

### Use Cases and Applications

The ChatGPT API has found application across diverse domains, showcasing its adaptability and utility. Some prominent use cases include:

#### 1. Customer Support Chatbots:

Enhance customer support systems with intelligent chatbots powered by the ChatGPT API. These bots can understand user queries, provide relevant information, and offer assistance in a conversational manner.

#### 2. Content Generation:

Automate content creation processes by leveraging the natural language generation capabilities of ChatGPT. From writing articles and blog posts to generating creative content, the API can be a valuable tool for content creators.

#### 3. Virtual Assistants:

Build virtual assistants that can assist users in various tasks, from setting reminders and answering queries to providing recommendations. The API's multi-turn conversation support ensures a smooth and context-aware interaction.

#### 4. Programming Help:

Develop interactive programming assistants that can understand and respond to user queries about code. This can be particularly beneficial for learners and developers seeking instant guidance.

#### 5. Language Translation:

Integrate ChatGPT into language translation applications, allowing users to engage in natural language conversations to facilitate seamless communication across different languages.

#### 6. Educational Tools:

Create interactive educational tools that offer personalized learning experiences. The API can be employed to answer questions, provide explanations, and engage students in dialogue.

### Harnessing the Power of ChatGPT API

To leverage the capabilities of the ChatGPT API effectively, developers need to consider certain best practices:

#### 1. Context Management:

Given the model's ability to understand context in conversations, [developers should carefully manage](https://www.reddit.com/user/samsmithhh1/comments/184xa3q/revolutionizing_crm_unleashing_the_power_of/) and pass relevant context from previous turns to ensure coherent and meaningful responses.

#### 2. System Level Instructions:

Experiment with system-level instructions to fine-tune the behavior of the model. These instructions can be used to set the tone, specify the format of the response, or guide the model in generating content that aligns with specific requirements.

#### 3. Error Handling:

Implement robust error handling mechanisms to manage unexpected user inputs or disruptions in the conversation flow. This ensures a smooth and reliable user experience even in challenging scenarios.

#### 4. Cost Optimization:

Optimize token usage to manage costs effectively. By understanding the token-based pricing model, developers can make informed decisions about the length and complexity of conversations to balance cost and functionality.

#### 5. Security Considerations:

When integrating the API into applications, prioritize security measures to protect user data and ensure a secure interaction environment. Implement encryption and follow best practices for data handling.

### The Future of ChatGPT API

As the ChatGPT API continues to evolve, we can anticipate advancements in its capabilities, improved model versions, and expanded use cases. OpenAI has demonstrated a commitment to refining and enhancing the API based on user feedback and requirements.

The widespread adoption of the ChatGPT API is indicative of the growing demand for intelligent conversational agents across industries. From revolutionizing customer interactions to transforming how we create and consume content, the API has the potential to redefine the way we interact with AI.

## Conclusion

The ChatGPT API represents a significant step forward in the realm of conversational artificial intelligence. Its ability to engage in dynamic and context-aware conversations makes it a valuable tool for developers seeking to integrate natural language understanding and generation into their applications.

As businesses and individuals explore the possibilities offered by the ChatGPT API, we can expect to see innovative solutions across various domains. Whether it's revolutionizing customer support, automating content creation, or enhancing educational tools, the API opens the door to a new era of interactive and intelligent applications.

As we look to the future, the continued refinement and expansion of the ChatGPT API are likely to shape the landscape of AI-driven conversations, unlocking unprecedented opportunities for creativity, efficiency, and user engagement. The journey of [ChatGPT API](https://www.cronj.com/blog/chatgpt-api-revolutionizing-streamlining-sales-for-businesses-cronj/) is not just a technological advancement but a transformative force in how we interact with and harness the power of artificial intelligence."
186r2ym,7,2023-11-29,First year in Bachelor of Computing Experience,u/Ok_Pudding_4763,curtin,https://www.reddit.com/r/curtin/comments/186r2ym/first_year_in_bachelor_of_computing_experience/,"Hi,

To preface this, I have recently completed my first year at Curtin as a full-time student. I went straight from high school to Uni

I noticed when applying for Curtin, in particular the Bachelor of Computing degree, that there wasn't much documentation about personal experiences with the Computing degree. So, in this post I plan to provide an account of the units I did, and how I found them.

**Year 1 Semester 1**

The first semester was difficult to say the least. Despite this though, I really enjoyed it. If you're worried about your performance in the first semester, just try to make it through. You'll find that there is an adjustment period (at least if you're joining from high school), and you'll be used to the intricacies .

Here are the units I did:

\- Fundamental Concepts of Data Security \[ISEC2000\] (9/10)

This unit was good fun and very easy. You don't really need to attend the lectures in person. Just follow along the lecture slides from home and do all the required work. All the tests were open book and were quite straightforward. ChatGPT is your friend for generating notes for these in-class assessments.

\- Programming Design and Implementation \[COMP1007\] (7/10)

This is your first real taste of University, I would say. This is a really important course, so pay attention. It's also really hard! I tell you what, I was disgusted when I just failed my assignment. I still averaged a 65% due to a great exam performance but after the in-class test and the hand-in assignment I was in bad shape... Make sure you attend the lectures and the workshops. They are good fun. If David is your lecturer he is a blast! Great guy and really tries his best to keep the class engaged. He will save you from damnation in this course. The first few weeks are quite straightforward but I recall the course becoming markedly more difficult as soon as Object Oriented programming (OOP) was introduced. **If there's one piece of advice for this unit, understand OOP, and understand it well!** If you can do that, you should pass with flying colours. Minus marks in this course for the pseudocode...

\- Introduction to Software Engineering \[ISAD1000\] (4/10)

Boring! Essentially, a repackaged PDI with easier concepts and more focus on testing and basic systems design. It's still difficult though and can be a lot of work. One thing I did enjoy about these courses were the workshops. The tutors in there were really chill and offer great advice with Uni at a time where it is much needed. The lectures were really boring. Don't bother attending, just read the slides. That's pretty much what is done in person anyways. Make sure that you start the assignments with a lot of time before hand (this goes for all coding assignments).

\- Indigenous Science Course \[NPSC1003\] (?/10)

Snoozefest. Irrelevant to the degree entirely. It's so irrelevant it's not fair to rate it. Focuses mainly on sourcing, academic integrity and english proficiency, which is necessary for Bachelor of Science, but not so much for Bachelor of Computing. I will say though, use this course as an opportunity to boost your average! It's really easy and you won't get many ""free"" grade boosters again...

**Year 1 Semester 2**

This was way more fun for me compared to Semester 1. I hit my academic stride and managed to get good results. Just keep pushing along. By this point you should be familiar with OOP, but by the end of the semester you will make leaps and bounds in your programming knowledge, and the fundamentals of OOP will be second-nature.

Here are the units I did:

\- Unix and C Programming \[COMP1000\] (8/10)

Learn pointers, and you will be fine. To be honest, I didn't really understand them until the end of the second assignment and I still averaged 98%. This course is marked **REALLY** easily. Just make sure you read the assignment specifications and you will be fine. Follow along with the lectures and you will be chillaxing. I would definitely attend these lectures as there are live demo's and its kind of interesting to see.

\- Data Structures and Algorithms \[COMP1002\] (9.5/10)

This. This is the course where by the end of it, you feel like a programmer. Essentially, DSA is PDI on steroids. But don't worry, you'll be much better equipped to handle the learning curve this time around. Please, for the love of god, **do the practicals!** Yes, they are only worth 2% of your grade each, but they will save you **HOURS** during the final assignment. Specifically, **DO THE GRAPH AND HASH TABLE PRACTICALS!** I cannot emphasise that enough. I loved this course, even though the lectures were uninspired and boring. Don't worry about attending lectures for this one, unless you are struggling with a topic. Even then, you are much better off going to the workshops. Go to the workshops! This course felt like a sheep in wolf's clothing. If you do the work, you will not only pass, but excel. Don't fear this course because an older student made it seem like it was the end of the world. Definitely be a little bit scared of it though.

\- Requirements Engineering \[CMPE2002\] (6.5/10)

This course is an interesting one. It's the only course that you get to ""choose"" in the first year. Also, there's no coding! It expands upon the system designs bit of ISE but its much less of a drag... DEPENDING on who you get in your group. **The most important part of this class is to choose your groups wisely!** You do not want dud members... I would say **attend the first few workshops, find the smartest people, and band together.** The lectures are boring, and the work is a bit of a drag at times, but its very unique compared to other courses. I feel like systems design is underrated and will be valuable to know in the future. Attend the workshops as it will be great for your exams. I should have attended the workshops more for this course.

\- Linear Algebra and Statistics for Engineers \[MATH1019\] (5/10)

Boilerplate math class. Pretty straightforward. The content is pretty much what is on the tin: statistics and linear algebra (specifically vectors). Don't need to attend the workshops (do the worksheets from home) and you only need to attend the laboratories up to the Lab Quiz. Following that, you will never even think about the lab component of the course again. If you do well on the quizzes and the in-class the eTest is straightforward.

I hope this serves a purpose to any one interested in B-Comp. Do not worry about being under-experienced with programming or being ""dumb"". I had no previous coding experience prior to the commencement of this course and I am averaging in the 80's. Keep an open mind, get through the first semester's learning curve, and you will be laughing. "

# Top Paper Highlight

[**The Anatomy of Machine Learning-Based Portfolio Performance**](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4628462)

This financial economics paper focuses on improving the understanding of how various firm characteristics and machine learning methods contribute to successful stock return forecasts.

&#x200B;

1. **Background**: The paper addresses a gap in the understanding of financial strategies that use machine learning to forecast stock returns. While these strategies have been effective in generating profits, particularly through long-short portfolios (buying stocks with high forecasts and selling those with low forecasts), the specific reasons for their success remain unclear.
2. **Methodology - Shapley Values**: The authors propose a methodology based on Shapley values, a concept from cooperative game theory. Shapley values are used to fairly allocate the contributions of individual predictors (or groups of predictors) in prediction models. This approach allows for a detailed understanding of how different factors contribute to portfolio performance.
3. **Shapley-based Portfolio Performance Contribution (SPPC)**: The paper introduces the SPPC method, which is versatile and can be applied across various prediction models, strategies, and performance metrics. Unlike conventional model interpretation tools, SPPC directly measures the impact of predictors on portfolio performance.
4. **Empirical Application**: The methodology is applied in a comprehensive study using the XGBoost algorithm and 207 firm characteristics to forecast individual stock returns from 1973 to 2021. The long-short portfolio based on these forecasts showed impressive performance, with high Sharpe and Calmar ratios and significant alphas.
5. **Analyzing Predictor Contributions**: The authors group the firm characteristics into 20 categories based on economic concepts and use SPPC to estimate their contributions to portfolio performance. Key groups like Risk, Earnings, Seasonal momentum, and Momentum were found to play significant roles in the portfolio's success.
6. **Insights and Implications**: The SPPC method not only quantifies the contribution of different predictor groups but also offers insights into the changing dynamics over time. For example, it was observed that the performance of the XGBoost portfolio declined after 2002, partly due to changing contributions from the Risk and Momentum groups.
7. **Conclusion**: SPPC is presented as a valuable tool in the financial machine learning pipeline, providing transparency and economic relevance to the results.

187c28b,5,2023-11-30,Question about using ChatGPT,u/IDontEvenKnowAlt,UCDavis,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCDavis/comments/187c28b/question_about_using_chatgpt/,"TLDR the best I can down below.

This might be me worrying too much, but it's weighing on my mind. I have a decently small essay due this weekend, and due to the amount of assignments and responsibilities I've had piling up, longstanding mental health issues I've been working through recently, and recently losing a loved one in my family, I've been feeling incredibly overwhelmed as of late, almost to the point of burnout. 

It was at this point I decided to turn to ""the dark side"" and use ChatGPT to help me write my essay. I'm very aware of the limitations of the engine as simply a language model trained to provide information that *sounds* correct but may not be so. Thus, I aligned my approach to *only* treat it as a tool, like my assistant, doing all the grunt work while I direct the ideas, *meticulously* inspect what it gives me for errors (which it almost always has) and ensure it still aligns with the points I want to make. 

Part of what I had to do was explain a certain piece policy for my essay, so I copy-pasted the parts of the original text outlining the provisions and told it something along the lines of ""summarize the following policy in detail in several paragraphs, with specific percentages, categories, and values mentioned."" Knowing how fickle ChatGPT can be I went line by line, changing words, and overall making sure it still made sense and aligns with my ideas. Overall, I'd estimate that I end up changing about 40-60% of the words that ChatGPT gives me.

Where it really helps me is with *structuring* things. Writing (from what I understand) is mainly about choosing the right words and knowing how to structure your ideas and paragraphs and such. Even though the words and ideas it gives me might kinda suck, it provides a good scaffolding. Writing is something I'm pretty strong at but it's always hard figuring out where to start while writing, and it's easy for me to get caught up with and spend a lot of time figuring out how to structure things. It's way easier to take something that serves as a good foundation, then build and edit upon that, than to build the entire thing from the ground up on my own. I'm even open to editing the structure itself. It just feels a lot easier to edit something to be accurate and fit my own ideas, than to actually write it myself.

I feel like the fact that I am able to look at what ChatGPT gives me and know whether it's right or wrong speaks to how I do genuinely know the material and what I am talking about. I almost feel like I'm a teacher on this topic, and ChatGPT is a student who's work I'm critiquing. It's like a fill-in-the-blank--yes, the structure is laid out for me, but I still need to know what to fill in. 

However part of me still fear and feels guilty about having this ""fill-in-the-blank"" foundation instead of building it from the ground up. My objective at the end of the day is to always be able to look at my essay and feel confidently that it is my work and my ideas, however I still wonder if it is laziness or even cheating, since it provides such a great advantage, having access to this pre-built writing structure. 

I'm definitely able to write, but I just don't want to put the effort into writing from the ground up, conventionally. Especially with all the stress I've been under, being able to use ChatGPT as a tool like this helps so much. But I feel pretty paranoid about the potential academic dishonesty consequences, with how severe they can be.

I feel l ike there's a deeper question about education and such here. With ChatGPT, I can produce a good product that is mine, but I didn't produce it by solely my own skill and hand. If the goal is to produce a good, original product, then this is good. However if the goal is to measure how good I am at writing on my own, and my capacity to do so, then this would obviously be a failure. I've come to realize something, and this is definitely a generalization--but to me it feels like school is about *strengthening your skills by producing quality products* while the professional world is about *producing quality products by using your skills.* I may not be exercising my writing-from-the-ground-up muscles by using ChatGPT like this, but I am producing a quality product (I hope) that's mine. 

You could argue that it's a crutch, but I feel like crutches are problematic due to them not being around forever--however with AI tools like ChatGPT, it almost feels like the opposite is true, we're only going to see *more* AI in our life and I definitely feel like as time passes working with AI like this will be normalized. 

This was long as fuck and definitely an essay in it's own right lmao, but I definitely needed to get it out. 

TLDR: is it ok for me to use ChatGPT as solely a tool with me proofreading and ensuring it aligns with my ideas and such while just using the structure and foundation it provides me"
187imqp,1,2023-11-30,Bakit kayong mga poor lahat na lang sinisisi nyo sa government?,u/Next-Fishing-3152,adultingph,https://www.reddit.com/r/adultingph/comments/187imqp/bakit_kayong_mga_poor_lahat_na_lang_sinisisi_nyo/,"Wala sa government yan, nasa tao yan. Basta ang topic about poverty, hindi nawawala ang ""government"" sa comment section. Partly may kinalaman ang government pero ang biggest factor ay nasa tao mismo. Ang tanong well disciplined ba ang mga filipino people? Ultimo pag flush sa public toilet, simple traffic rules at pagtapon ng basura sa trashcan hindi nyo nga magawa. Kaya kayo mahirap dahil lahat na lang sinisisi nyo sa government. It's the government, it's the economy, it's my boss, it's my parents, it's my neighbor, it's my job, it's my city, because God want me to suffer.

My analogy to that is like a professor and students. Kahit ang Professor ay once a week lang magturo or hindi magaling magturo pero kung responsible kang student at masipag mag aral, papasa ka pa din sa quizzes at board exam. Pero kahit pinaka magaling na professor pa yan kung pala absent ka at hindi nakikinig sa klase, babagsak ka pa din sa exams. Parang ganyan sa government. Wala sa government yan, nasa tao yan. Kahit bulok government natin if legit na magaling kayo, magagawan nyo yan ng paraan to succeed.

Tutal lahat na lang sinisisi nyo sa government, if magka rashes ba ako or magka pimple sa ilong, ang dapat ko sisihin si Bong Bong Marcos?

Kahit richest countries including Spain, England, Canada, Ireland and France to name a few ay madami ding homeless. Does it mean bulok din government nila? Again, nasa tao yan. If your life stinks, it's your fault. Lame people, blame people. I recommend you to watch Asian boss videos on YouTube.

Mas matalino pa ang AI kesa sa inyo.
I asked ChatGPT: Why do people like to blame others for their misfortune?
ChatGPT: ""Blaming others can be a defense mechanism to cope with personal failures, as it shifts responsibility away from oneself. It may also result from a desire to protect one's self-esteem or preserve a positive self-image.""

And lastly I wanna share this with you. I want you to watch this 5 minutes video clip or just in case kakatamaran nyo pa panoorin ang video, I'll post it here na lang.

7 things poor people do that the rich people don't.
1. Poor people watch T.V
Rich people read books.

2. Poor people get paid based on time
Rich people get paid based on results

3. Poor people blame others for their misfortunes
Rich people take responsibility for their own failures

4. Poor people focus on savings
Rich people focus on investing

5. Poor people think they know it all
Rich people continuously learn

6. Poor people believe that money is the root of all evil
Rich people believe that poverty is the root of all evil

7. Poor people have a lottery mentality
Rich people have an action mentality

187k24r,2706,2023-11-30,Cheating with AI and Invisible Ink at the Same Time,u/BlackOrre,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/187k24r/cheating_with_ai_and_invisible_ink_at_the_same/,"One of the English teachers came to me one morning and asked me for one of the blacklights in the chemical storage closets. I don't normally interact with this teacher, so I asked why. The English teacher said she wanted to read invisible ink. I had one of those invisible ink pens with the light attached to it, so I gave it to her.

How this teacher operates is that she gives students 5 in-class essay prompts. The students are allowed to bring outlines to the in-class essay, but they are not allowed to bring anything else. They are required to submit the in-class essay along with their outlines. 

A student decided to write down entire essays in invisible ink on the back of the pages where the outlines were and used an invisible ink pen's light to see the essay and copy it down practically word-for-word. 

I said to the English teacher that at least the student put thought into the prompts and synthesized five essays. If only that knowledge stuck around in the student's head. 

The English teacher simply told me, ""Don't get your hopes up."" 

The student used ChatGPT to write the essays because they copied the ""Certainly! Here are ..."" They did this not only on the back of the outline but also on the actual in-class essay. 

This feels like a sitcom scenario. I'm not creative enough to make something like this up. I also will need to deal with this student in a few years."

187pbl2,1,2023-11-30,Chance a very anxious latino student for Cornell ED.,u/Advanced-Story8039,chanceme,https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/comments/187pbl2/chance_a_very_anxious_latino_student_for_cornell/,"I know we're 15 days away from the decision notification, but my anxiety has reached a maximum and I want to know what to expect. 

Intended major: Human Ecology; Human development

**Demographics:** Half Italian, half Peruvian

**Hooks:** I come from a very diverse family setting, with members from opposite career choices; I have a ""learning disability"" that was previously treated with medication and I worked very hard to overcome it as I decided to drop off the treatment.  

**Application type:** ED, international first year student

**Financial aid:** Middle household income; possible yearly contributions in the 30-40/year range. 

**Unweighted GPA:** 16.33/20 according to the Peruvian grading system (9th and 10 grade are tough because I was going through some issues with my treatment, but I ended 11th grade with a 18/20 unweighted GPA, and there's an overall very strong upwards trajectory)

**SAT:** 1480 (790 math and 690 R&W). I plant to take the SAT one more time in December and estimate a 1520-1550. This will be… practically useless for Cornell, though, lol. 

**Predicted IB score (I think I'll actually get a 41):** 42/45 (7s for English B HL, Business HL, Environmental systems and societies SL, and 6s for Physics HL, Spanish A SL, and Math AA SL). Also, I did my extended essay on Business. I applied with my predicted score.

**Activities:** 

Founded engineering club (11th and 12th grade)

Founded human ecology club (11th grade)

Founded two businesses and made 5k from sales (11th grade)

Invested my earnings so I could buy school stuff (11th grade)

**Essays:**

I told ChatGPT to grade them, and I got a 83/100 for the CommonApp's, 85/100 for the Cornell supplement, and 85/100 for the CHE essay. I did five trials for each and got the average score.

The only problem is, I made one rather obvious punctuation mistake in the CommonApp essay and a typo for the CHE essay. 

**Recommendation letters:**

I got one from my Physics teacher, who knows me for three years. I'm very confident it's in the 80-90/100 range. 

I got the other one from my environmental systems and societies teacher, who also knows me for three years. Like with my Physics teacher, we created a very nice bond, so I'm estimating it's in the 80-90/100 range. She hinted that I should feel very satisfied with her recommendation letter.  "
187qumn,1,2023-11-30,(Productive) AI education for educators. What do we need?,u/GFOTY916,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/187qumn/productive_ai_education_for_educators_what_do_we/,"I know I know, professional development meetings are not always popular among teachers, and (at least in my experience) are sometimes a waste of time to meet some bureaucratic regulations. BUT, I notice a trend of lack of education, or accessibility to the education, around AI for teachers. I know we were all talking (mostly negatively) about ChatGPT and its potential harms in the classroom this past year. A lot of teachers I know have a defeatist, or fear based mindset towards AI in general. If we could have an effective, productive sort of PD or workshop for teachers, led by a researcher in the actual AI field, what would you prefer that look like? What questions would you want answered? 

  
I'll start - I'd love to have a session just brainstorming mindful ways to incorporate ChatGPT into lesson plans - something like having the student write an essay to a prompt, and then give the same prompt to ChatGPT, and observe the differences. This could be an opportunity for the student to learn about and develop their own unique voice and writing style, provide a mirror for content they may have missed, as well as a chance to critique any shortcomings of the ChatGPT's response. As a mirror and/or a collaborator, AI is an amazing tool for artistic creation. It's not going away, so the fear-based avoidance is anything but solution-based, in my opinion. 

What issues would you like to discuss, if a PD like that existed? What questions would you want answered? Do you think there's a gap between the (often, gate-kept) AI/tech industry and education sectors? If your district funded an opportunity to attend a tech/AI conference, would you embrace it?

(For context, if it matters, I'm a prior high school English teacher and now do consulting in Trust and Safety for tech companies around humanitarian issues. So that's where my curiosity about this is coming from.)

TLDR:  If we could have an effective, productive sort of PD or workshop for teachers, led by a researcher in the actual AI field, what would you prefer that look like? What questions would you want answered? "

187wbwq,1,2023-11-30,Questioning the use of ChatGPT in big corporations,u/throwaway_5910,Hasan_Piker,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hasan_Piker/comments/187wbwq/questioning_the_use_of_chatgpt_in_big_corporations/,"As we all know, ChatGPT's been out for a year now, and I personally find that it's a great tool to use, if used properly and *ethically* (how this is achieved is up to debate).

It poses many questions as to how much we value people today, because AI-tools like these have already replaced people, not just because they can automate tasks.

ChatGPT is a serious threat to young students, as well as anyone else who might feel like they could abuse this thing (people with mental health issues come to mind). Students and poor mental health go hand in hand (obviously), so the path of least resistance becomes the most viable option, which I'd argue is really bad in this case.

As young students who learn less because of tools like ChatGPT optimizing for ""speed"" essentially, their impact in the workplace suffers, and they are **more** likely to become another cog in the machinery. As you'd expect, big corporations love this, but if this continues, I believe we need to get ready for a really bumpy ride soon.

People in positions of power already don't care about doing things the right way, so who can guarantee that someone isn't using ChatGPT to do their biding at work? Some guy could just feel lazy one day and copy-paste some stuff they get from ChatGPT, which is just a fancy language model posing pretending to be intelligent, and could *easily* miss the bigger picture.

The use of this tool worries the fuck out of me, and although the model is trained on people's inputs, it does not matter, because the tool itself is affecting *people*. Software geeks have it all wrong, I'm afraid, and the only they see is a tool that lets them get things done faster (which isn't always the best approach). People in large tech communities mostly focus on the technicalities right now, especially because of all the pointless OpenAI drama going on. FOMO's a real bitch, but luckily someone's living under a rock.
