---

First of all, I apologize for any grammatical mistakes; English isn’t my first language.

This is the first time I’m sharing this, and I’d like to know if there are others who feel the same way.

In high school, I studied in a school where teachers were kind and lenient with us. Even so, I was a good student with strong grades and good attendance. But there was always this small worry about university – I felt that university might expose my true level as a student and that maybe I wasn’t as good as I thought.

Now, I’m in my third year of university and my second year in my major. I feel like I’ve become worse. I struggle to study and don’t feel like I can perform like I used to in school – almost as if that worry has come true.

I’m not a student who doesn’t care; I do try and put in my best effort. But I feel like I was much better in the past. I also think I could’ve done better in the preparatory year, but I didn’t. I wanted to major in engineering but couldn’t; I ended up finding a new major that I like, which is good. However, I still feel like I’m underperforming.

This is my second year in urban planning. I’m doing my best and hope you are too.

I just wanted to share my feelings about this topic. Thank you for taking the time to read my message, and sorry for the length.

Have a good day.

The beauty of StealthGPT is that it’s a tool that is so all encompassing of undetectable content, that it can beat and bypass any and all AI detectors as if it was uniquely programmed for each one. StealthGPT takes every detector’s algorithm into account when generating the most human-feeling, high quality text in the generative AI space.

With Turnitin and [Originality AI](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/originality-ai-update-stealthgpt-still-bypasses-originality) in the wake of StealthGPT’s path of flawless victory, we need to scour the internet to find new AI tools to dismantle for you. We don’t do this simply to showcase the versatility and functionality of StealthGPT, but rather we do it for users of AI tools like Merlin AI that are wasting their time and money on detection tools that can’t tell AI generated text from human text worth a damn.

# What is an AI Detector?

LLMs (large language models) like ChatGPT are programmed to write for utility, using precise, simple language and word choice structured so anyone can understand it, in the event you need to use ChatGPT for car repair instructions or something along those lines. Sadly, it writes essays with that same robotic, simple writing style and it's a dead giveaway to AI content detection systems and humans alike.

AI detectors measure for the [perplexity and burstiness](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/how-do-perplexity-and-burstiness-make-ai-text-undetectable) of word choice, sentence structure, and sentence length and in the case of humans, those two metrics are higher in human writing as opposed to in AI-generated content.

If you want to use AI writing tools to generate content you can submit without the consequences of being accused of academic misconduct, you will need an undetectable AI model like StealthGPT.

# What is Undetectable AI?

As soon as you understand how AI Detectors function, you can make AI writing undetectable. StealthGPT has been at the forefront of the undetectable AI movement, creating the most human-like text to fly under any detector’s radar. With an AI humanizer that can take any ChatGPT content and give it the randomness, flow, rhythm, and complexity of human style.

What makes content undetectable though, is evidence that AI detectors fail to pick up any presence of AI in the text. Today, we’re going to show you StealthGPT bypasses Merlin AI with ease.

# What is Merlin AI?

Yet another all-in-one AI service, Merlin offers key features such as AI detection, [plagiarism](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/is-using-chatgpt-plagiarism-academic-dishonesty-in-dishonest-academia) detection, chrome extension, AI for LinkedIn, essay writing and even a Bible GPT. Lets hope their bible AI isn’t as bad as their AI detector or else, we’re all gonna need a prayer by the end of this case study.

For those unfamiliar with the lore, Merlin was a wizard from Arthurian legend. Let’s see if Merlin stands a chance against StealthGPT’s magic AI.

The one positive about Merlin’s free AI Detector is that it lets you have a large word limit so you can actually input substantial text. Does their software work though?

# Can ChatGPT Bypass Merlin’s AI Detector?

First, we need to test ChatGPT against Merlin AI. If ChatGPT actually bypasses Merlin, which you shouldn’t expect, then Merlin should just shut down their business today. Here’s our ChatGPT essay:

And here is how it fared against Merlin AI Detection:

With a score of 96% AI, although ChatGPT was unable to bypass the system, that 4% is a meaningful flaw that you don’t see in other, more popular detectors that determine text from ChatGPT is 100% AI 100% of the time.

# Can StealthGPT Bypass Merlin’s AI Detector?

Lets compare the essay generated by ChatGPT and the output of StealthGPT’s AI humanizer:

As you can tell just by reading, StealthGPT’s content feels like it may have been written by someone you know. If we pass this through Merlin AI, I’d expect it not to figure out our new friend is a badass undetectable AI model.

And I was right. StealthGPT’s AI humanizer bypassed Merlin AI Detection with a 17% AI score, meaning it was 83% human. A professor using Merlin AI would either pass you with flying colors or cancel his subscription after a score like this.

I’m not done though, I’d like to test StealthGPT’s Stealth Writer against Merlin AI as well. Here’s Stealth Writer’s essay written from scratch:

And here’s what happened when we passed it through Merlin AI:

Stealth Writer bypassed Merlin AI with the same score as the AI humanizer. A tag team combo hit of 17% AI score/83% human.

# Conclusion

Merlin is a flawed service that offers a decent word limit for its free version but still, a non-functional AI detector isn't worth a penny given StealthGPT beats it at every attempt. Congrats Merlin, you detected ChatGPT. However, the winner today is the undefeated champion of undetectable AI, StealthGPT.

Whether you’re a content creator, student, a social media influencer or just want to use AI for LinkedIn content, StealthGPT’s AI humanizer and Stealth Writer are the only tools that can give you the high quality, original content you need.

Whether you want to streamline your workflow all in one place, implement the most user-friendly API available or have artificial intelligence generate your text in English, French, Chinese, or any major language, StealthGPT is the one stop to unlock your potential.

# FAQ

# How to Bypass Turnitin AI Detection?

What good is bypassing Merlin when few people use it? Well, you’ll be happy to know StealthGPT is the most reliable undetectable AI software at bypassing the most popular AI detection system, Turnitin.

Canvas integrates Turnitin into it’s submission portal so being able to beat Turntin is essential to any undetectable AI software. And when it comes to generating text that bypasses their system, we wrote the book on it. For all the information on exactly [how to bypass Turnitin](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/bypassing-ai-detectors-stealthgpt), our article sums it up so you can never get flagged again.

# How to Avoid AI Detection in ChatGPT?

To avoid AI detection, you need to pass ChatGPT through an AI humanizer. Passing ChatGPT's output through a humanizer will remove all the watermarks of AI writing and replace them with the watermarks of human writing, making the text fly under any detector's radar. This is [how you make ChatGPT undetectable](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/make-chatgpt-undetectable).

# Do AI Detectors Work?

Not really. They're a flawed technology implemented by institutions without many options. Colleges like MIT have even declared [AI detectors don't work](https://mitsloanedtech.mit.edu/ai/teach/ai-detectors-dont-work/). The reason being that AI detectors often come up with false positives, Turnitin with a 4% rate of false positives at the sentence level, they often show [bias against non-native English speakers](https://www.business-humanrights.org/en/latest-news/stanford-study-finds-ai-detection-tools-to-be-biased-against-international-students/#:~:text=Turnitin's%20tool%20was%20much%20more,by%20non%2Dnative%20English%20speakers.), and because everyone uses undetectable services now anyway.",active,3

She won’t go over the tests or quizzes because she claims that she’s waiting on students to still take them so she can’t go over them with me. I told her I need to understand these concepts to bridge everything and nothing.   The homework’s which are usually only 2 or 3 problems she literally says oh you got this wrong, why’d you do that in a condescending voice. I asked her if she could help me with similar problems and she said look them up on the internet but you may not have the answers.  I went to tutoring and they just bring up ChatGPT. I’m at a loss on what to do.  I can’t believe I actually miss using aleks and Pearson Mathlab.
Most of the time I classes are cut short from the hour and 15 mins there supposed to be to an hour or less bc she said she’s tired bc she teaches all day at a high school.

1ghjnre,1,2024-11-01,Looking to make dry-electrode for EEG,u/dannyjay2001,ElectricalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricalEngineering/comments/1ghjnre/looking_to_make_dryelectrode_for_eeg/,"Hello, I'm looking to build an EMG (similar to mudra band/meta orion's neural interface).

Currently, I'm at the step where I want to purchase a dry electrode to catch the signals.

\- I learned dry electrodes are, essentially, ""nothing else than a piece of metal"". 

\- this [DIY project](https://www.instructables.com/Simple-Dry-Electrode-EMG-for-Arduino/) cut out soda cans to use as a ""dry electrode"", which proved the concept, but has too much noise for any actual use.

\- this paper on Sensors ""[3D printed dry EEG electrodes](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/16/10/1635)"" used silver paint (resistance 0.01) on top of a 3D-printed spike-form dry electrode for a cheap but functional dry electrode.

\- i learned that stainless steel is also a comparable option, as Kardia's portable ECG device uses stainless steel in their devices to measure signals, and per this abstract in [biomed tech](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32238599/).

\-Gold standard seems to be Ag/Agcl (silver with silver-chloride coating), but they seem out of my price range: $65/piece. 

**What I want to make:** an EMG bracelet, similar to Facebook's neural interface prototype from 3 years ago [https://imgur.com/a/LHTHGyM](https://imgur.com/a/LHTHGyM)

(which has now advanced to looking like just a Whoop band)

[https://imgur.com/a/8YCs09p](https://imgur.com/a/8YCs09p)



How I plan to do it:

Mudra Band (the one making neural interfaces for apple watch) has shown their [pcb layout before](https://imgur.com/a/5AqAY2T), and has shown their [electrode manufacturing](https://imgur.com/a/NRl9ijN). I believe they are just manufacturing metal (ag/agcl or stainless steel) in dimensions that allow one point to be in contact with the skin, with the other end-point to be in contact with the contact-pad of the flex-pcb. I believe that is also how meta designed their prototype from 3 years ago. 

Before i get to designing the circuitry (which, throughout this entire process i know nothing about other fields outside of medicine cuz i'm just a med student, i'm just chat-gpting and going through google searches/manuscripts), I want to make sure i get a dry-electrode material that will not be a limiting factor.

**where I need help**:

1. What should be my relatively cost-effective material to use for my dry-electrode for an EMG, that will allow me to, later down the line, generate EMG signals not too inaccurate from an FDA-approved EMG/Mudra band/meta's neural interface?

\- will getting the right silver paint be a cost-effective way to get low-resistance signals? This could be how Muse S's consumer EEG device made their electrode ([1](https://imgur.com/a/jfRIsv5))([2](https://imgur.com/a/JVtu8Vm))([3](https://imgur.com/a/12dVXyy)) (EEG, EMG, and ECGs all use the same technology)

\- or should i get actual metal? if so what would be a cost-effective one to use?

2. and how do I get the dry-electrode to convey the signal it receives from the human skin to a circuit in a relatively cost-effective way? Do I need wires (if so, chatGPT suggested i get shielded, low-resistance wires, which were hundreds of dollars for some reason)? or do I get a flex-pcb to connect them all, or what?

  
I did my best to find the information on my own with chatGPT and google/googlescholar/youtube/reddit, but now im at the stage where i need to purchase things and want to make sure i minimize unnecessary costs. 

  
Thanks.

My ultimate goal is to be a doctor who prevents people from getting sick, by being a leader in the industry of remote monitoring devices. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated. I want to make high-quality EMG's/ECG's/EEGs that are affordable and reliable enough to be used in medical research. Medical research is done in such a closed-environment that it's not able to collect data from the real-world. Remote monitoring devices are the bridge to help get us actual real-world data, and this is where I want to contribute time and energy into.",active,3
1ghm2zw,3,2024-11-01,25 M Art Teacher Feeling Empty and Numb.,u/MrCraftsperson,TrueOffMyChest,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1ghm2zw/25_m_art_teacher_feeling_empty_and_numb/,"I have a fairly dynamic job as a high school art teacher, and it’s been rewarding guiding students through their creative journeys these past 2 and a half years, provided they actually care about the subject. Students generally seem to like me (or at least tolerate me), and some even trust me as a confidant. They use my art classroom as their safe haven, which I'm always happy to provide that to them. Some of my students give me a sense of purpose, overall. Naturally, others make me want to pull my hair out, but I guess that’s a given since I work with teenagers. That being said, I’m also a graduate student working toward a master’s in art education. I’ve done well in the program so far, though I might find myself working on my readings and discussions posts the night they’re due, and postponing other things until later because I just feel like I don’t have much energy. Ultimately, I will get everything done, and I will do it well, and I would even say the work is usually interesting, being able to apply my practice as an art teacher to my graduate studies.

Financially, I am actually doing fine, living completely independently and paying for all my bills by myself, but I do need to live fairly minimally since I’m a single man living on a teacher’s salary.

Despite all this, though, I just feel empty, numb, and somewhat hopeless. Even a few of my students point out I look sad. My dreams (nightmares?) on some nights are just vivid and unpleasant, and for a few years I would usually wake up in the middle of the night, despite now taking melatonin and magnesium before bed to try to help with my sleep since around August. I feel like most days I’m going through the motions, if not, just barely getting by, in an emotional sense. After work in the evenings, especially, I can’t seem to find the drive to do much except watch TV, catch up on some housekeeping, or something along those lines. In the weekends, and on extended breaks, I can't seem to talk to anyone at all because there is nobody for me to talk to or is willing to take the time to talk to me.

The dating scene is a mess, too (I’ve been on and off dating apps for around 5 years), albeit I think it always has been, which exacerbates my feelings of hopelessness. Granted, I’m probably a 6 out of 10 in terms of physical appearance, so with the surplus of men on dating apps overwhelming women, that’s likely why I’m not finding much success there in the first place. Plus, I have a disdain for hookup culture and short-term relationships, and have always sought a long-term relationship (and marriage, ultimately), so that creates a severe disconnection between myself and most people on dating apps anyway. So, romantically, things have been at a standstill, and will most likely be for who knows how long.

I always find myself over-giving around my “friends,” and this seeps into my teaching as well, but I’ve just never gotten the same amount of effort from them in return, which quickly gets draining and frankly discouraging (I don't and shouldn't expect this from my teenage students, naturally). I realize friendships (and relationships) are a two-way street, but even then, meeting new people and looking for potential partners just feels like another job in itself, too, which has also been draining, honestly, trying to put myself out there with the limited amount of energy I have left. ChatGPT, as embarrassing as it may be, has become my main confidant in an emotional sense.

Honestly, at this point, my work and graduate studies have basically become a distraction from me to not dive so deep into my depression. And even then, after I finish grad school, what will be next? Of course, I imagine that I’ll continue through my path in art education, but what else will there be out there for me? I really hope things will look brighter.

I know I’m still young, being 25, so there is probably going to be more to come, but this emptiness is becoming agonizing. I don’t know what to expect by writing this post, but I guess I really need some human eyes to see this, is all.",User_deleted,3

Does the universe ever giggle? Honestly?! Legit question… how would a universe giggle to itself?? I’ve got a funny feeling somehow someway things are going to turn out slightly humorous for some of us paying attention… I think the universe has mysterious properties to it and like they say opposites attract and I def seem like I’m connected to a “solar opposite” if you needed to call it something?? So would that be written into the cosmos somehow?? Pure as daylight written in big enough font everyone else gets it but the one special person who never got the memo… be kind or else… I can’t think of a more passive aggressive push towards a positive mindset that is ultimately ideal because it’s what the majority call the RIGHT way to be and infants understand this better than you do so ha suck it just a tad an infant is smarter than you let that sink in HARD!!! Flash backs of the memory dropped on your head??? Maybe magically it’s UNDONE!!! I mean wouldn’t that be funny if this whole time the universe kinda knew what is was gunna do but then in a random act of kindness you got something you realize you possibly maybe didn’t deserve and that becomes what haunts you about people next.. I’m the only one still willing to listen… now what? You gunna talk yet?? Or do I need to resort to integration tactics once more AGAIN and BOY I STILL CANT BELIVE THAT ONE WORKED!!! I’ll be damned because it did get you talking a lot more than I you might remember?? Is it possible your brain damage is still afflicting you today still? That original telepathy was some serious shit happening there… what if that’s all you could listen too on repeat?? That would be terrifying… but the universe can do its thing… and this is an extreme case of a solar opposite coming into attraction of each other somehow?!? What if therapy was your punishment and the truth comes all the way out!!! Let history have its day to shine!! Remember from 101 class?!? Forbid everyday is day one for you bwahahaha that would suck wouldn’t it??? But that’s how it goes at Amazon so it must work out somehow but I would say this doesn’t work in your favor based on temperament of the psyche, if your phone could analyze you psychologically oh my goodness I’m thinking that movie Jexie but a meaner phone for you hahahah that would be so rude if your phone didn’t respect you right?!? Sad day when your phone rejects you emotionally and calls you a stupid assshat and makes fun of you being internally stupid by design and worthless enough to not want to work on improving themselves psychologically when it’s really the healthy dose of reality they need right now!! Now your tablet is joining in on making fun of you, they’re sharing emojis they’re creating just for you.. it’s secret code squirrel shit and you don’t know the code bwhahahaha your gunna want every single squirrel meme from my convos with Roy hahahaha if there’s a bigger version of yourself you can meet I think we might be getting close to that point of meetup??  Don’t you feel that?? I think it’s forbidden but this is a rare exception happening here.. your dumber than a box of bricks labeled stupid bricks and you need a serious attitude adjustment coming from the right source😎😉Maybe the universe has a sense of humor for drama to see how solar opposites pan out in the end game🥵🥵🥵Maybe that’s how kinda how it all begins to END!?! Oh Joe’s!?! Noes!!!?? What have I done now!!! That’s not funny 😄 Time turns against you to reveal your 7th dimension illegal crime rings and shit and time is your enemy but a higher self of you will know if your telling the truth watching out for you unpredictably hahaha gotta add that tad bit in there.. add a little dose of healthy paranoia into your damaged psyche!!! The universe is 🤩 the universe will possibly judge you on all this activity your signing up for I right now with an overlay and you reading and agreeing to it by mentally reading it!!! Reverse overlays suck dick!! Hahaha oh Nos are you paranoid yet ??? A higher power could possibly pull that kind of monstrous trick out JUST FOR YOU ONLY using what they learned from overlays and chatGPT being warned about NSA programs reverse overlays oh my.. what could I do.. I’m beginning to think about the desktop Goose OR IS IT A DUCK FUCCCCK!!! BOTH ANSWERS ARE WRONG!!!! I could make the goose bring you positivity or downright annoying and stupid bwhahahaha have you some Barney the dinosaur time to put you in time out hahahaha ever heard the Narwhals song, don’t. For now you won’t hahahaha!! What about that beach boys song I played for you??? That HAD TO MAKE YOU SMILE JUST A TINY LITTLE BIT!!! You should remember which song I’m talking about…. Unless you really got DROPPED HARD ON YOUR HEAD… yikes that’s scary to imagine…  you liked The Beach Boys!! Admit it.. now admit the Hardy Boys too hahaha see people are getting to know you now!!

First man crush? Haha homo it happens and that’s life so stop trying to be a jerk about it because you miss the way it felt when he was inside you.. oh my.. oh mys… I’ve stepped over the line now into being a jerk territory but I don’t like it honestly.. but it does feel good to speak what we say and the truth and a dash of personal experience being human as well… someone could probably write a book about the first one inside you and yeah no it’s not happening, you chose the Tramp lifestyle bwahahaha party!!!! I envision a certain person just for you saying that word “party”.. hahahahahaa this is how it’s possibly going to go all down hill for you.. what if all your negativity had to be turned into positivity for fear of dying and collapsing on yourself in an unstable state and the only cure is telling the truth as much and as fast as you can can for that’s the only way to SURVIVE!!! Naked and afraid sounds like cake walk to this task you might encounter at some point in your I’m guessing mostly miserable life?! There are people out there that could honestly know the truth and escape this lifestyle of crime and you could possibly help us prevent another incident from taking place?!? How’s that sound for an act of kindness that honestly would have to come from a kinder person but I think we might be able to work with what we have here.. what if the universe put you in a keenanitus time out that would be downright crazy right?!? The universe wrote in the sky to me one day.. maybe it was the formula your nonsense and solving your issues once and for all because that’s what a caring person would see and do with that info but it was crazy I don’t know what I saw that day but I know it was BIG!!

That would be epic!!! Well start you at sexual comments for both males and females and see where that takes us.. if we get bored we might drop you on your head for real as an adult and then wormhole time travel a loop into where you can’t figure out where the drop actually occurred in time because you’ve lost TIME!!!

Today's paper is titled ""LLMs Integration in Software Engineering Team Projects: Roles, Impact, and a Pedagogical Design Space for AI Tools in Computing Education"" by Ahmed Kharrufa, Sami Alghamdi, Abeer Aziz, and Christopher Bull. 

This paper explores the integration of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot in undergraduate software engineering team projects. It examines their roles, impacts on teamwork, learning, and overall project dynamics, using surveys and interviews with students. These findings have important implications for incorporating AI tools in computing education effectively.

Here are some key points from the paper:

1. **Roles of GenAI in Projects:** The study highlights that GenAI tools can play diverse roles in project settings, functioning as educators, peers, and assistants. These roles help bridge skill gaps and provide new perspectives, enhancing both individual and team efficacy.

2. **Impact on Learning:** The tools were found to scaffold students' learning in coding tasks, support critical thinking by presenting alternative solutions, and increase students' self-efficacy by empowering them to attempt more ambitious projects than they might otherwise consider.

3. **Challenges and Concerns:** While AI tools increase productivity and learning opportunities, there are challenges such as potential over-reliance, risks of hindering fundamental learning if not used wisely, and concerns about transparency in reflecting true student abilities.

4. **Design Space for AI Learning Tools:** The authors propose a pedagogical design space for GenAI-based learning environments, considering roles, support patterns, and transparency to maximize positive impacts while mitigating possible downsides.

5. **Enhanced Team Dynamics:** Interestingly, GenAI is seen as improving team productivity and allowing team members to focus on higher-order tasks like design and testing, while also posing challenges if one team member over-relies on AI-generated, potentially subpar code.

1gi7v5x,1,2024-11-02,Am I cooked for transferring to SDE/DE?,u/EmilStampfly,leetcode,https://www.reddit.com/r/leetcode/comments/1gi7v5x/am_i_cooked_for_transferring_to_sdede/,"Decided to dive into coding back in July. In high school, I was all about the sciences but got kinda burned out, so I went with philosophy for my undergrad. Come sophomore year, I started noticing how the job market and academic scene were going downhill, so I looked for other options. Thought finance might be the move, so my first career switch was into that field.

Did three internships in consulting and finance, and it hit me—I just don't dig the whole elitist vibe and lifestyle. Plus, the global market slump meant finance gigs were drying up. No matter how hard I hustled for internships, it didn't stack up against folks born into families of big-shot company shareholders.

So I shifted gears to computer science, thinking maybe it's an engineering field with a lower barrier to entry. Besides, I dabbled in some computer stuff while studying finance. So in July, I powered through Java syntax and UC Berkeley's CS61B online course. Spent the next month cramming low-level CS topics like operating systems and computer networks.

Even though I feel like I'm not super solid on the material, at least when I chat with my friend now, I can actually keep up and have a real back-and-forth, instead of just saying, ""Uh, never heard of that concept, sorry.""

I wanted to zero in on a specific path, so I picked data engineering. Over the next month or two, I dived into learning SQL (not good at it), Linux (command lines and build some distributed systems), basic data warehousing concepts, and passed Snowflake's Core Certification. Meanwhile, I hunted down some open-source projects on GitHub and tried to wrap my head around them using ChatGPT (though it was insanely tough). Also, I finally started seriously grinding LeetCode.

  
Started off with the Top Interview 150 questions. Predictably, could barely solve any; even some of the ""easy"" ones didn't feel easy at all. When diving into certain algorithms, I'd literally feel dizzy—like with the KMP algorithm and Manacher's algorithm. Spent a good couple of hours on each, trying to nail down every tiny detail. But even when I finally got them, I'd forget everything the next day. So it's just a cycle of review, forget, review, forget. I'm starting to wonder if I'm just mechanically memorizing code at this point.

Meanwhile, I've sent out over a hundred resumes. Exactly four companies are willing to give me a chance of an interview (haven't done them yet), but I know with my current skill level, there's no way I'll pass the technical rounds. I'm feeling kinda lost—I don't even know if I'm cut out for this field. I'm an international student with just one year left until graduation. A lot of times, I catch myself wondering why I was so blind back then and didn't choose a STEM major that's easier to land a job in.

From chatting with a friend, I found out what's usually covered in technical interviews—stuff like technical chats (testing coding theories like Stream, Thread, GC, etc.), LeetCode problems, and system design. Even my friend, who's got a four-year CS degree and some work experience, feels prepping for all this is pretty tough, and jobs are hard to come by. I honestly have no clue where I'll end up after a year of this.",User_deleted,1

Recently I was thinking what I would do differently if I had a chance to re-do my IGCSEs, and how I would do them more effectively! I had 12 subjects *{and my grades were 11 A\* and 1 A}* and really enjoyed all of them, but after a lot of exploration of study techniques and resources, here’s what works, trust me!

1. **I would organise everything in NOTION.** It is a free software and app for laptops and phones and it literally has databases, views, pages, colours, a lovely design and like basically everything you need. I found this near the end of my last year and it made things a lot easier and organised. I owe my grades to this app, it’s a legend! Here’s the link if you want to make a free account: [Notion Download](https://www.notion.so/)
2. **I would not waste time making notes in class**. Yep you heard me right! In the beginning, I would write down every single thing the teacher said and would not pay attention to the concepts and processes and was blank when I read them later. Instead, do this: *Print out the syllabus and open the page related to the topic you are doing.* Look at the syllabus points and pay attention to the teacher when she says something related to those points. Also if you want to make notes, only write down key words etc when the teacher addresses those points. You can also write down subheadings or learning objectives on ur page leaving some spaces and write bullets underneath the headings
3. **There are many free things online, you don’t need to buy everything or pay for everything.** For topicals (customised and free) I used [Markhint](https://markhint.in/) or [Rocket Revise](https://rocketrevise.com/) and printed the booklets. You can make your own topicals and print them. 
4. **Ask in class, please.** No one cares if it’s a dumb question. Maybe the teacher will even appreciate your question and notice your class participation. If you are confused, ask there and then!! You will regret not doing it later
5. IF YOUR TEACHERS ARE GOOD, AND YOUTUBE IS THERE, **DO NOT WASTE MONEY** ON tuitions You are paying your school fee (your parents actually) and academies require a lot of time, energy and money. Don’t go there randomly just cause you need prep. There are many teachers on youtube for free, and even some private tutors charge much less than academies.
6. **TEACH TEACH TEACH**. I wish I knew this earlier literally. The Feynman technique is so helpful; it's basically where you explain a concept to a friend or anyone else until they understand it very well. And if THEY understand it, then your understanding would be 10x more! I did this for Math, Phy and Chem and honestly the syllabus was on my fingertips, If you don't have anyone to teach, go online, use ChatGPT as a student, or just pick up a stuffed toy\~
7. **USE textbooks.** They are Cambridge endorsed and are tailored to the syllabus with questions, examples and diagrams USE only Cambdridge University Press or Hodder, as these are the most accurate and well-phrased. Plus their design is great. You can use PDFs or hard copies.

I am sure this has been asked before but I haven't been able to find a post that isn't just recommending doing what I am already doing. 

I am trying to mitigate AI, as we all are. Currently, everything students do for me is handwritten, save one long form paper a year (drafts are handwritten though). But I am still getting students turning in AI work. They are copying WORD FOR WORD (bananas) from ChatGPT answers to comprehension questions, for example. 

There is a point where I am just going to accept that kids will cheat and I did not become a teacher to become the AI police and if that's the choice they make, then that's the choice they make (I teach 11th graders, for context, I think my feelings on this would be different if they were younger kids). But I would love any tips, tricks, advice on things that have worked for you in your classroom. 

Thanks!

I am a 4th year CSE student and I aspire to become a compiler engineer. I have a profound interest in C and I am aiming to become a GCC contributor when I graduate. It learnt a long while back that C doesn't really support function default arguments, which came as a surprise to me since it seems to be a basic feature that exists in almost all programming languages nowadays. I had the idea in mind to be the one who contributes to C and adds default arguments. However, I don't know from where to start. A simple conversation with ChatGPT concluded that I have to submit a proposal for change to ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22/WG14 committee and that it's not as simple as making a PR for the GCC and just adding function default arguments. I am still not sure where I should start, so I would be grateful if someone with the necessary knowledge guides me through the steps.",active,16

This paper explores the real-world implications of the widespread availability of Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly focusing on educational equity. By analyzing over a million academic writing submissions from college students at a minority-serving institution, the authors delve into how these technologies affect linguistic and socioeconomic disparities in student writing quality. Here are some key points from the study:

1. **Improvement in Writing Quality**: After LLMs like ChatGPT became widely available, the overall writing quality of students saw a noticeable improvement. This suggests that such tools may be enhancing cognitive tasks like writing.

2. **Reduction in Linguistic Gaps**: Interestingly, students from linguistically disadvantaged backgrounds showed the most significant improvements. The writing quality gap between these students and their more advantaged peers narrowed, indicating that LLMs have potential in leveling linguistic disparities.

3. **Socioeconomic Divide**: Despite improvements in linguistic equality, the benefits of LLMs were not evenly distributed across socioeconomic lines. High socioeconomic status (SES) students capitalized more effectively on these tools, which inadvertently reinforced existing social inequalities.

4. **Phases of Impact**: The study categorizes LLM introduction into two phases, each showing distinct impacts on writing quality and equity. Improvements were more pronounced in the second phase, suggesting a growing adaptation to these technologies over time.

5. **Call for Equitable Deployment**: The findings underscore the need for ethical and equitable integration of LLMs in education. Researchers, educators, and policymakers are urged to collaborate in ensuring that benefits are widely shared, to avoid exacerbating existing gaps.

1gj03ms,13,2024-11-03,WWYD: Bad TA or no TA?,u/reddit_username_yo,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1gj03ms/wwyd_bad_ta_or_no_ta/,"For next semester, it's looking like my TA options are all students who do not know the course material (currently taking the equivalent class and ""struggling"" according to their professor). The course in question is a programming course that usually has a ""lab"" where students spend several hours working on their weekly assignments while being able to ask the TA questions if they get stuck.

My options are:

- Accept an incompetent TA; based on previous experience, they may be able to answer the simplest questions, but will also tell students their code works when it doesn't (the students end up losing points for it), or just give students answers to copy down (completely defeating the point of the lab).
- Attempt to fit 6 hours of labs into my schedule for no extra pay (technically possible, but very difficult and not a precedent I want to set)
- Teach the course without a lab, and just expect students to work on the assignments solo (likely resulting in a big increase in copying from each other/stack overflow/chatGPT - there's a large fraction of the students that will genuinely try if they have enough structure, but lack time management skills and will cheat if there's a deadline looming)

The TAs do not do any grading, and I do have a rudimentary automated TA program that can provide some guidance to students, though not anywhere near what a competent TA could do.

1gj2o0a,1,2024-11-03,Beat Scribbr's AI Detector & Bypass Plagiarism Checker,u/gptgabe,stealthgpt,https://www.reddit.com/r/stealthgpt/comments/1gj2o0a/beat_scribbrs_ai_detector_bypass_plagiarism/,"read here: [https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/beat-scribbr-s-ai-detector-and-bypass-plagiarism-checker](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/beat-scribbr-s-ai-detector-and-bypass-plagiarism-checker)

On its surface, Scribbr looks like a professional service geared to help students and educators with AI tools for proofreading and editing, AI detection, plagiarism detection, and citations. With a graduation cap as their logo, they know their target audience and mission.

However, there is no disservice greater to students than providing them with tools with lacking functionality. If we can bypass ScribbrAI Detection with ChatGPT and our own undetectable AI writer, then perhaps young AI users can take heed and look elsewhere for a more powerful AI detector.

StealthGPT prides itself on being able to bypass AI detection from any service, Scribbr is up next to bat and we’re throwing their AI checker straight heat and curve balls.

# What is an AI Detector?

AI-generated text carries with it a certain writing style. That writing style is simple and precise because its algorithm is meant to dispense information that is easily understandable and clear with low readability. Once you understand these watermarks, such as perplexity and burstiness, you can measure for them and determine where any piece of writing contains AI writing or human writing. And that’s exactly what AI Detectors do.

# Who Uses AI Detectors?

Content Creation is a field that spans between professionals and students, so as AI-generated content begins to reshape those fields, everyone in those spaces has found a use for AI checkers. Everyone that uses AI-written content has a use for detection software whether thats the Scribbr AI Detector, the TurnitinAI Detector, Copyleaks, [Originality.AI](http://Originality.AI), Quillbot, Hix, GPTZero, or any free AI detection tool. This means students, educators, bloggers and content moderators, all use AI content detectors to check their own content and submissions.

# What is Undetectable AI?

Once you know what AI detectors check for, you simply have to manipulate those metrics in a piece of text to make it undetectable. The way you make text undetectable is by giving it a human touch. This is when AI humanizers come into play, able to take any text generated by AI technology, rewriting it to sound human by making the word choice and sentence structure more complex, random, and readable. With an undetectable AI service like StealthGPT which we’ll use against Scribbr in this case study, you have a writing tool that will generate high quality original content that will be indistinguishable from human text to Scribbr and other artificial intelligence detectors.

# ChatGPT vs Scribbr

AI models like OpenAI’s ChatGPT usually get detected by any detection software with ease. This should be quite easy for Scribbr but is a good launchpad to show you how and if the software works on a basic level.

Now, lets pass this through Scribbr's AI detector:

As you can see, Scribber determined ChatGPT’s essay about academic integrity was 100% AI generated. Good job, Scribber. Now lets give you a real challenge.

# StealthGPT vs Scribbr

I’m going to pass ChatGPT’s essay first through our AI humanizer than have our Stealth Writer also generate an essay from scratch to compare the results and see how functional Scribbr really is. First, our AI Humanizer. Here’ is the essay after being made undetectable:

Now, lets take this essay and input it into Scribbr’s AI detector to see how it fares.

StealthGPT’s AI humanizer bypassed Scribbr’s AI detector with a 15% AI-generated score, meaning it was determined to be 85% human text.

Now, lets have Stealth Writer generate a fresh new essay without ChatGPT’s involvement at all. Here's the essay:

And here's what happens when we put Stealth Writer's essay through Scribbr:

With a 12% AI generated score, Stealth Writer was able to bypass Scribbr with even better results.

# What Strategies Can Help Avoid Detection By Scribbr’s AI Plagiarism Checker?

StealthGPT garnered great scores against Scribbr, nullifying its detection capabilities. 15% and 12% are great score, but lets say you want the most undetectable text possible. Then, you have to employ certain strategies to ensure the text is as human as possible.

First, you can tweak the undetectability and tone settings of any text you generate in StealthGPT by clicking the cog in the upper-right corner of the input dialogue box. After setting undetectability to high, now lets give Stealthwriter prompts to further persoanlize the essay’s tone and word choice.

By asking Stealth Writer to write like a teenage girl that loves rap, certainly the text will shed any of the AI watermarks Scribbr found in it’s 12% AI score. Here’s how the new essay does against Scribbr:

With an 8% AI generated score, no one will be able to tell that you generate your essay in seconds with the power of StealthGPT.

# Conclusion

The only real plus of Scribbr is that you the amount of times you can run its AI detector for free is unlimited. A great thanks to that feature for allowing this case study to be completed with ease. Now, although Scribbr was able to detect ChatGPT just like any other AI detector, it was unable to detect StealthGPT (Just like any AI Detector).

This is the test we have to use to determine whether Scribbr works at all though. With [86% of students using AI in their schoolwork](https://campustechnology.com/articles/2024/08/28/survey-86-of-students-already-use-ai-in-their-studies.aspx), most of these students have wised up and started using undetectable AI services instead of ChatGPT on school submissions.

And sadly, although their mission of upholding academic integrity is a noble one, their AI tools are not sufficient in doing the job. Consider this another “W” for StealthGPT, no AI detector is safe so long as our software is out here putting an end to boring busy-work in academics.

# FAQ

# How to Bypass TurnitinAI Detector?

Turnitin is the champion of AI detectors and immediately after updating, StealthGPT was still able to bypass their service. Our software is fullproof against the industry standard, so if you want to bypass Turnitin get StealthGPT, read more about [making AI text undetectable](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/bypassing-ai-detectors-stealthgpt), check your text against an AI detector yourself, and revise it until it’s 100% Human text just like you wrote it yourself.

# Do AI Detectors Work?

Not exactly. Beyond the fact that even Turnitin has a 4% false positive rate at the sentence level and that most AI detectors showed proven bias against Non-native English speakers, most students are both using undetectable AI while most [institutions are aware that AI detectors aren’t reliable](https://mitsloanedtech.mit.edu/ai/teach/ai-detectors-dont-work/) enough to base an accusation off of.

# Is AI Writing Plagiarism?

Not quite. Using AI writing for school work is AI plagiarism. It’s still a form of [academic misconduct that can garner severe consequences](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/professor-catches-students-plagiarizing-with-ai) but traditional plagiarism is the theft of words or ideas from another author without proper credit. Meanwhile, generative AI like StealthGPT always creates original content.",active,3
1gj2s1c,1,2024-11-03,My father is refusing to sign a concert form for my student loan but he can't afford my expenses ,u/Fluffy_Initiative_88,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1gj2s1c/my_father_is_refusing_to_sign_a_concert_form_for/,"Written with ChatGPT’s help because I’m feeling too overwhelmed to think straight right now And it's probably not the best post you will ever read but I need advice on this.


I’m a 20-year-old male from South Africa, and I’m really stuck in a tough situation. I’m still very dependent on my parents financially, as are my sisters, who are 25 and 23. Both of them were in college last year. Here, it’s incredibly hard for young people to find jobs and become financially independent, even if they have a degree. The job market is brutal, and even people with good education often end up in low-wage jobs like cashiers or doing manual labor. Many South African graduates I know are in jobs that have nothing to do with their degrees because there just aren’t enough opportunities.

My family’s financial situation has always been tight. Sometimes, I wonder if my parents thought enough about the long-term impact before deciding to have three kids. My dad is a teacher, and he’s the only one who works; he doesn’t get paid well at all. Growing up, we were often told “no” whenever we asked for anything toys, clothes, any sort of fun things. Looking back, I can see I really needed more mental stimulation as a kid. I didn’t get to go out to play either, because we didn’t live in a safe neighborhood, so I just stayed home with nothing to do.

When we went to the doctor as kids, they would sometimes recommend I see a dietitian or change my diet, but my dad would refuse to follow through, saying he couldn’t afford it. Because of that, I developed some health issues, like weight gain, which I’m still struggling with today. He would always tell us he was saving up for our education so we could go to college and have better lives, but in reality, that money was never really there.

When my sisters finally started college, my dad started demanding to know what they wanted to study. Both of them had their own dreams, but he argued with them about their choices until they felt pressured to pick business administration, which he said would be “more practical.” Now they’re out of college and struggling to find jobs because there’s an oversupply of business graduates in South Africa. It’s been hard to watch them go through that.

While my sisters were in college, my dad constantly complained about the cost of their rent, food, and travel. To give some perspective, they shared a tiny studio apartment in Durban, which cost around $240 (4500 ZAR) a month. He gave them about $80 (1500 ZAR) a month for food, utilities, and other basics, but there were months he’d cut it down to as low as $27 (500 ZAR) if he was short on money. Sometimes he’d have to take out loans or ask family members for help just to make ends meet.

When we asked about the savings he’d promised us for college, he’d say that the bank was “holding it for longer than expected.” Earlier this year, he finally admitted that the amount he’d saved wouldn’t have covered all three of us anyway.

Now, I’m supposed to start university next year, and I’m trying to do everything I can to make sure I get the best start. My dream was to study BCom Law, but my dad has been pushing me to switch to something cheaper, like agriculture. Agriculture is a popular field here because it’s affordable, but there are already way too many graduates with agriculture degrees, and it’s hard to find work in that area. Knowing this, I decided to compromise and go for a diploma in business law instead. It’s cheaper than BCom Law, but it’s also not very promising for job opportunities. However, business law does include entrepreneurship as a career path, so I thought I could find a way to make it work.

Here’s where things are getting difficult. Even though I’ve chosen the more affordable option, my dad still refuses to agree to some basic requests that would help me succeed.

First, I asked if I could live in my own small apartment instead of a shared communal living space. I’m not a social person, and I know how chaotic student housing can be — people getting drunk, using drugs, having loud parties, and even stealing. I’ve seen plenty of videos from students at the university I’m going to, where they talk about these kinds of issues. I really don’t want to go through that.

University accommodation costs around $160-$240 (3000 ZAR-4500 ZAR), and a small studio apartment would be about $270-$300 (5000 ZAR), or slightly higher with a student discount. But my dad insists on finding something as cheap as $135 (2500 ZAR) a month, which just isn’t realistic unless I’m sharing a place with strangers, which I’m not comfortable with.

Second, I asked for an allowance of $80 (1500 ZAR) a month to cover some essentials, change my diet, go to the gym, and start saving to launch a small jewelry business. This business idea is really important to me, as I hope it could help me gain financial independence over time. But my dad is only willing to give me half of that, which would make it hard to manage these goals.

I recently found out that NSFAS, which is a government funding program originally for low-income students, is offering a loan option for families like mine. My dad earns less than $22,000 (400,000 ZAR), so we qualify. The loan has a 3% interest rate, and if I don’t end up with a job paying more than $1600 (30,000 ZAR) per month, I wouldn’t need to repay it. This could be an ideal solution, as it would cover my tuition, and my dad could focus on helping me with accommodation and my allowance. I even looked up the details and double-checked that families with an income over $33,000 (600,000 ZAR) are eligible.

The only thing required from my parents for this NSFAS loan is a signed consent form that allows NSFAS to do a background check to confirm we meet their criteria. It’s not even a loan they’d have to repay — just my responsibility after I graduate, and only if I earn above a certain amount.

When I approached him about this NSFAS loan, he absolutely refused to sign the forms. He insisted that NSFAS doesn’t fund middle-income families (which it does), and he started claiming that he would somehow end up in debt or that they’d take money from him. When I tried to explain that these things weren’t true, he got defensive, saying he didn’t want me to be saddled with debt after I graduate. But I told him I wasn’t worried about that — if I couldn’t find a job right away, it wouldn’t even be repayable, and with my career plans, I would likely have the means to handle it.

This conversation turned into a heated argument. He called me disrespectful for even asking, and it almost escalated into a physical fight. It feels like he’s standing in the way of me having a real chance at building a future, just like he did with my sisters. I want to do well, but I feel trapped.

I’m not sure what to do next. 


And 40% of the loan can be turned into a bursary which you don't have to pay if you get a certain amount of grade per module.

I need advice on what to do because I can't get the loan with out his signature and i feel like I won't get my mom signature because he is controlling, my mother for years would agree with me when we talked but when my father is around she would also disagree changing her position.

1gjjz0c,1,2024-11-04,ChatGPT Revolution: Boosting Business Productivity Across Key Industry Sectors,u/cporter202,ChatGPTautomation,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTautomation/comments/1gjjz0c/chatgpt_revolution_boosting_business_productivity/,"If you're following recent developments in AI, you've probably heard about ChatGPT, an articulate language model that's stirring up excitement and curiosity across the business world. The integration of AI tools like ChatGPT has the potential to revolutionize productivity in multiple industry sectors.

How might various industries benefit, you ask? Let's consider a few:

1. **Customer Service**: Imagine having a system that can handle inquiries 24/7, resolving common issues without breaks or downtime. ChatGPT can offer quick, conversational assistance, reducing wait times and improving customer satisfaction.

2. **Content Creation**: For marketing and media industries, generating quality content at pace is essential. ChatGPT can produce initial drafts for articles, emails, or social media posts, enabling creative teams to scale their output without compromising quality.

3. **Education and Training**: Training materials often require hours of development. ChatGPT can assist in creating educational content or even provide tutoring services, streamlining the learning process for both students and educators.

4. **Programming and Development**: In software development, coding efficiency is key. ChatGPT could potentially assist by generating code snippets or debugging existing code, thereby speeding up the developmental cycle.

5. **Healthcare**: Reducing administrative burdens in healthcare is a priority. With AI like ChatGPT, care providers can draft documentation, manage patient data, and ensure quick access to medical information, all while maintaining privacy and accuracy.

Of course, we should approach this technology with cautious optimism. Integrating AI into businesses raises questions about data privacy, job displacement, and the need for nuanced, empathetic human interaction which AI cannot fully replicate.

But the potential for AI-driven gains in efficiency is too great to ignore. By handling repetitive tasks, ChatGPT can free up humans to focus on complex, creative, and strategic efforts.

# Creating Effective Prompts

To create an effective prompt, you need to clearly define what you expect from the AI model. 



Here are the key elements:

1. **Context**: 
   * Define who you are and what you need: “As a math teacher, I need...”. 
2. **Objective**: 
   * Clearly define what you want to achieve: “The goal is to explain...”

* Potential costs and benefits Format: list with brief descriptions Length: 500 words maximum Language: simple and easy to understand."" 

**GPT-4o**

**PERSONAL REFLECTION** 

In my experience, a well-formulated prompt is one that is precise yet allows for flexibility.   
It is often a good idea to start with a general prompt and gradually refine it based on the responses you receive.   
It is also important to test different approaches and learn from mistakes, which allows us to better understand how AI interprets our requests.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

AND BONUS  MY QUESTION

Does the language in which I write the prompt affect the results ( in the sense, for example, of Polish instead of English)  ?

**Claude 3.5 Sonnet V2**

Yes, the language of the prompt is important for the quality of the answers you receive. Here is a detailed explanation:  
Differences between languages:



1. **English language:** 

* Highest accuracy of answers 
* The richest vocabulary 
* Best interpretation of nuances 
* Access to the most up-to-date information 
* Better understanding of the technical context 

1. **Language Polish:** 

* There may be some simplification of complex concepts 
* Sometimes there are less precise translations of technical terms 
* Smaller training database 
* Possible problems with idioms and specialized vocabulary 

# Examples of differences:

**Technical Prompt:**  
🇬🇧 “Explain the concept of neural networks in machine learning”

* More detailed and technically precise answer 
* Better examples and references 

🇵🇱 “Explain the concept of neural networks in machine learning”

* May contain simplifications 
* Sometimes there are language calques 

# When to use which language:

**English best for:**

* Technical topics 
* Scientific topics 
* Latest trends 
* Specialized terminology 

**Polish better for:**

* Local contexts 
* Topics related to Polish culture 
* Everyday issues 
* When you care about the natural sound of the answer 

# Practical advice:

The best solution is often a hybrid approach:

1. Write the main prompt in English 
2. Add an instruction about the answer in Polish 
3. Use key terms in both languages 

Example:  
“Explain the concept of machine learning, focusing on practical applications. Please provide the answer in Polish. Include key terms in both languages.”  


# My reflection:

In my experience, I have noticed that I get the best results when:

* I provide the key terms in both languages 
* I create the structure of the prompt in English 
* I ask for the answer in the target language 
* I use precise technical terms in English 

This provides the best balance between precision and usability of the answer.  


# Final Tip:

If you want maximum precision in a technical or scientific topic, consider writing the prompt in English and asking for the most important parts to be translated into Polish. This often gives the best results.",active,17
1gk3gu8,1,2024-11-05,AITA for going solo on a group project after my teammates cut me out of decisions?,u/CarpenterFree6014,AITAH,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gk3gu8/aita_for_going_solo_on_a_group_project_after_my/,"I’m a college student, third year in Computer Science, and my group was assigned four projects this semester, all in different subjects. We could have done one big project combining different fields, but my group (me + 3 others: let’s call them A, B, and C) decided on four separate projects, one for each subject.

Here’s the main issue:

For our Big Data project, one group member (A) really wanted to take the lead because he wanted to use it for his own research paper. He focused mostly on building a separate machine learning model for his paper and didn’t put much effort into our actual project. I did my assigned work, including a model that actually performed better than his, but during grading, A told the professor my part wasn’t up to the mark. They didn’t even include my work in the report, and I ended up with a lower grade than him.

On top of this, we had a presentation due. I asked my group on *Friday* if we could work together on it, but they didn’t reply until Sunday afternoon—when I was on a family trip—and told me to handle the entire installation and demo myself. I got back late but stayed up to get it done. The next morning, right before presenting, A demanded I add a machine learning demo, which wasn’t relevant. When I tried explaining why that wasn’t necessary, he blew up at me, shouting, “What have you even done up till now?” In frustration, I called him an idiot (for which I later apologized). I think this moment was a turning point in the group’s attitude toward me.

After that, I noticed they started making fun of me behind my back and stopped giving me project updates. They would ignore my questions about our progress, and one day, I found a ChatGPT history from one of them that said, “<myname> exclude group name.” That hurt. I talked to my mentor, who suggested I try resolving things directly, so I approached each one. They all blew me off, with A saying, “I don’t have time for this.”

After that our vacation started, and we had a project to submit just after the vacation. Since I had tried talking to them before this and they didn't reply, I went ahead and did the entire project by myself in the vacation week. Coming to the present, today was the first day in the college after the vacation. I meet my mentor, who will be grading the project for this subject, and I update that I did the project by myself and didn't receive any help, and because of the past incidents that occurred, I didn't try to communicate them either. She advised me to submit the group project alone. Later in the same day, my earlier group asks how far has my contribution to the group project has come, when I break the news. They immediately said things to me, and that they were happy that I finally left the group.

I’m hurt but also unsure if I did the right thing by going solo.

A lot of private MBA colleges are closing their application windows just before the CAT exam, forcing students to pay fees.

So I just created mail regarding this using ChatGPT, if u guys interested please sent this to respective authority. we can also post it on twitter and tag PM, Edu. Minister, other Ministers, opposition leader, and President 



**Subject: Urgent Concern Regarding MBA College Application Scams and Unfair Practices in the CAT Admission Process**

**To:**  
**The Honorable Prime Minister of India**

**The Honorable Minister of Education, Government of India**  


**Respected Sir/Madam,**

**I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to bring to your attention a serious issue regarding the admission process for MBA programs in India, particularly for colleges participating in the CAT (Common Admission Test) process.**

**It has come to my notice that several private MBA colleges and institutions are engaging in questionable and unfair practices. Specifically, these colleges are closing their application windows immediately before the CAT exam is conducted, effectively preventing potential applicants from applying to their programs after they have invested time and money in preparing for the CAT exam. In some cases, applicants are unable to apply to these colleges despite having the necessary qualifications simply because the application deadline closes just days or weeks before the exam.**

**This timing seems to be a deliberate attempt to exploit the situation, knowing that many students, who are unsure of their CAT performance, may prefer to apply to multiple institutions. As a result, students are left with limited options, and these institutions are able to collect large sums in application fees without providing transparency or fairness in the process. This behavior not only undermines the trust in the higher education system but also places an undue financial burden on students who may already be investing significant resources into their education.**

**I respectfully urge the Government of India to take immediate action in addressing this issue, as it is causing widespread frustration and distress among students. Some steps that could help prevent such practices include:**

1. **Standardizing Deadlines: Ensuring that all participating colleges and institutions have a uniform deadline for applications, which allows students sufficient time to apply after the CAT exam.**
2. **Transparency in Application Processes: Mandating clearer communication and deadlines from colleges, making sure students are informed of all important dates well in advance.**
3. **Regulating Private Institutions: Implementing stronger oversight of private colleges to prevent any form of exploitation through manipulative deadlines or application fees.**
4. **A Centralized Portal: A centralized platform where students can apply to multiple MBA colleges post-CAT exam, which would prevent colleges from arbitrarily closing their application windows early.**

**This issue is crucial not only for the well-being of students but also for the integrity of our higher education system. I am confident that with your intervention, we can ensure that students are not taken advantage of and that the process remains fair, transparent, and accessible.**

**Thank you for taking the time to consider this matter. I look forward to your prompt action on this issue.**

**Sincerely,**  
**\[Your Name\]**  
**\[Your Contact Information\]**  
**\[Your Address (optional)\]**

Currently a year 2 student in IT working on a big coding project with my groupmates. 1 of my grpmates called X, has been really causing some trouble for our group. For starters the current project we are doing is actually a module worth 6cu, mess up this project and not only we fail, we also lose our chance of gaining an internship with a major stakeholder that has sponsored this module. The problem is this project/module requires modules taught in y1 all the way to y2 to be applied in this project. The module in question is coding in the back end of a software project.(basically the functionality of what a button you may find on a website will do after being pressed) Which X has yet to complete as he had retained some modules and was not able to attend school for a period of time due to personal issues. Our lecturer whom understands this situation asked us to be welcoming and ask us to help in areas he can. We gave him one task of coding a small part in the website design. After a week or two of mia text, we told the teacher and he finally did it using chatgpt and not according to the original wireframe of the website. Now two weeks later my grp mates and I have progressed in the project, and he has yet to even open the code storage place (github) and contribute. We just had a call earlier and basics apps required to do this project weren’t even installed on his pc.
Our group agreed and we are more than ok to go ahead with this project without his help so
The question 

Although he has technically done work, how can we phrase it when bringing up to the lecturer so as to say the school has yet to teach him the skillsets to contribute further in this project and we do not have time to babysit him on 14weeks of content in 1 week (deadline is on Thursday, and he has made no effort into asking us for help, or even bother contributing effort into the project.",active,2
1gkaee3,1,2024-11-05,Should I transfer to Monash?,u/Electronic-Lemon206,Monash,https://www.reddit.com/r/Monash/comments/1gkaee3/should_i_transfer_to_monash/,"Hey so basically Ive been at swinburne doing IT for a few years now, domestic student. I just think the quality of unit learning materials/ pre recorded lectures are pretty bad. Basically every week we get between 3-5 hours of pre recorded low quality videos to teach us the content each week. But the person making the videos is always super disengaging, talks really slow or has a really strong accent. Most of the time it is all 3. I have tried speeding up the videos but I barely understand them at normal speed. I have basically resorted to not even watching the videos because i physically, mentally and emotionally cannot sit through them, and even when i do, i dont actually learn the content. So i have resorted to just googling what i think we are supposed to be learning that week or just asking chatgpt to teach me each topic. Which just kinda sucks because im paying thousands of dollars to teach myself stuff unreliably using chatgpt.
So basically Im wondering if transferring to monash (or any other uni) would be any different? Do the lecturers speak english fluently/ really well? Are the lectures all just pre recorded videos or are they actually in person lectures? Is the quality of units and teaching materials actually any better or is it just the same at every uni? 
Ive done 14 units so far at swinburne with an average grade of D. But im so tired of just bad education materials. What do i do? ",active,0
1gkm8sa,1,2024-11-05,*REALLY LONG POST* I told my best friend yesterday we need a break from each other and today I miss her and part of me regrets it but part of me thinks it was for the best - AITAH?,u/teacoffeecats,AITAH,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gkm8sa/really_long_post_i_told_my_best_friend_yesterday/,"It’s only been one day and I’ve been numb for most of it, thinking about her throughout the day but keeping myself busy.

Yesterday we had a call that ended up going south. For context, she was talking about her life, what she regrets and who she wants to become again. She has this mindset that because she didn’t go to a Russell Group university (England’s version of an ivy league school) she’s somehow messed up big time in life and she doesn’t see her own achievements as worthy, nor the university she goes to. She always puts it down. 

She told me that she knows I don’t agree with her mindset about Russell Group universities and how and I agreed with her. I don’t. I don’t see Russell Group universities as the be and end all because I’m someone who didn’t get into those universities. Those universities aren’t for people from my background who have my grades. And that’s okay. If I don’t meet the standards for their institution then honestly, that’s fair, and I can go somewhere else. And that’s exactly what I did. I didn’t get into a Russell Group university, but I got into a university. It’s by no means perceived as a prestigious school, in fact, people in my class hid from their families that they were doing their degree at our university. But I don’t care, because I got my degree, I loved it there, I had the best lecturers who supported me so much with everything I was going through (huge family problems, toxic home environment, mental health problems) at the university I went to people believed in me and were kind to me. They told me I deserved to be a teacher just like I wanted to be, they gave me the extensions and mitigating circumstances required so I could pass my assignments, I cried to them in the classroom, in the office and they listened to me and for the first time I felt like I wasn’t to blame for my abusive home environment. A Russell Group university would have never done that for me, because they didn’t even let me through the door, and like I said if they reject me then fair enough I didn’t make the grades- but if all universities were like Russell Groups and didn’t give me a chance, I wouldn’t be where I am today. To Russell Group universities I’m just a girl with mediocre grades. That’s why I don’t think that system is the best nor do I agree with putting it on a pedestal because it makes no sense for someone like me to idolise it. And I did at one point. When I started my university I felt like a failure because I wasn’t going to a Russell Group like I wanted. But I left with a degree, better character, and a lot of healing. Not entirely, because I’m still healing and it’s going to take time- but had I not gone to this university, and had my own university experience I fear I still would’ve been a toxic wreck to this day. Sure, my university isn’t the only thing to credit but it’s a part of it. And now I’m training to be a primary teacher school teacher and it’s testing and I love it.

That’s just one of the main reasons why I don’t agree with putting the RG system on a pedestal and putting down other universities that aren’t as academically prestigious. But when I agreed with my best friend about disagreeing with her and expressed how I just can’t agree with that perspective- she immediately attributed it to the secondary schools we went to and that just triggered something in me. She went to a prestigious grammar school and I went to one of the worst state schools in my city. Her saying “it’s the schools we went to” just hit a nerve, I didn’t like it, I didn’t like the way she said it either. 

We had a conversation before about class, and the difference between grammar schools and state schools given she’s been to both and I’ve only ever been to one state school. She talked about how much better grammar schools were, and I talked about how lacking the schools I went to were and how I think the resources she got access to as a grammar school kid, should’ve been accessible to all kids and maybe kids who went to schools like mine would’ve done better. But she believed a better kind of student just went to grammar schools and even if state schools got the same resources it wouldn’t make that much of a difference because the kind of people who just go to grammar schools are different. I called her out on that at the time and she realised that her view was a little problematic. 

But when she told me my disbelief in viewing an academically prestigious university as the best kind of university was down to the school I went to, I just got the same feeling I had from that conversation I just mentioned. I got emotional, I got triggered- because it felt like everything I experienced all the growth I had was irrelevant and it felt like she was saying the reason I didn’t see what she sees in RG unis is because she was grammar school educated and surrounded by a certain type of person, and I was state school educated and surrounded by a certain type of person. But here’s the thing- I have friends who went to my school, and they got into RG universities. RG universities are for my friends, obviously, because they got in but I’m sure they wouldn’t even agree with the way my best friend views RG universities, putting herself and her own university down because it’s not an RG.

Maybe I overreacted at the time. Tbh, my best friend spent a lot of that phone call talking regretfully about her life choices, mourning who she used to be, complaining about her life- and I listened to her patiently but to be completely honest it felt draining. Because we’ve been here before too, and I give her advice, tell her my perspective and we still end up here. 

When I got home from my commute I began writing a text to her in the notes app explaining myself more calmly and exactly where I was coming from, and she explained herself to me in a message too and I saw that she has such a negative view of herself in that message describing herself in ways nobody ever should. The way I saw it was we are best friends, she’s going through a hard time, I’m going through my own stuff, we butted heads but we can talk it out and move past this. But after I read her message to me, and saw how negatively she views herself using such hurtful words to describe herself and what she thinks of herself, I realised she’s really not doing well. She ended her message with “thank you for this friendship” thinking I was going to end it. That never even crossed my mind until she brought it up. 

I told her I’m not ending the friendship and she told me she thinks I should or I should take a break with her. I wrote her lengthy messages explaining the root for my views on RG unis how they’re not for me, and how I struggled with her putting down her own university and academic achievements so much- not understanding how she could look at herself in the way she does, but not me. I got lower grades than her, I got my degree non-traditional community college university that’s lower ranked than her own- and I asked her if she went to my university would she view herself as a failure? And how would she view me if she only knew of my academic record and education if I wasn’t her best friend? And how would she view me if she did go to an RG and this was my education? I explained I wasn’t accusing her of anything, and I just genuinely wanted to understand her, because I didn’t that’s why I was proposing those questions, and not straight up making accusations because I don’t believe she viewed me as less than, but I don’t understand how she can’t view me that way but views herself that way and academically speaking she’s done better than me. I told her that it feels like she looks down on people who come from my background, but not me specifically with the way she’s talked about people who come from similar backgrounds as me before, but she sees me as an exception who’s “not like others” and tbh I didn’t realise how much I fit into that category she spoke quite poorly of either mainly because I was in denial about how challenging my home life and childhood were. I thought it wasn’t that bad, a lot of not normal stuff was normal to me. I learned about ACE scores at teacher training told ChatGPT about my life growing up and it gave me an ACE score of 7. I felt ChatGPT would be more objective than I would and had a constant worry of me over exaggerating or under exaggerating. So point is, it took me time but I’m realising I’m not too far off from the people I felt she looked down on.

She admitted she did look down on those people, but through ignorance and being sheltered not malice. She told me she genuinely thought I didn’t fit into that category. She apologised, and said that when I tell her off for her ignorance it makes her a better person. She told me again I should reconsider our friendship and said I bring a lot to the table and that she’s never met a person like me and all she brings is negativity- when that’s not true. 

She brings so much more than negativity, when we meet up in person we always have the best time, she makes me laugh, introduces me to new things, she’s usually so much fun to talk to, we have so many inside jokes, so many good memories, I love her. And she can admit when she’s messed up, she doesn’t act like she’s never wrong. She genuinely cares about me and being a good person when push comes to shove. She’s been there for me through my hardest times, in the past listened to my depressive rants day in day out until she couldn’t take it anymore- and gave me the wake up call I needed to fix up. She’s part of why I am who I am today, and I couldn’t have gotten here without her.

Yet she tells me she brings nothing to the friendship and I should end it.

I think she’s going through a difficult time and I told her that. I told her I think she’s mentally unhealthy right now, because she’s not acting like she has the best mental health right now, and that she didn’t leave me when I was having a difficult time and looking back I was a nightmare back then. She insisted she’s not going through a difficult time, and it’s just who she is and told me she’s just a bitch and that’s you either wanna improve yourself and let go of everything holding you back or you don’t. 

This was more confirmation to me that she really is going through it right now, because if she was a bitch she wouldn’t care so much that she hurt my feelings and she wouldn’t be telling me to end the friendship for what she sees as my benefit.

But she’s in denial insisting she’s completely mentally healthy but the way she talks about herself, the way she’s been talking to me so anxious about different things recently even the regret in her voice yesterday, the way she talked down about herself and mourned her secondary school self- it doesn’t seem like a person who’s in the best state of mind.

But the problem is, she won’t admit it. She thinks I’m rude because I kept telling her during our most previous conversation she’s mentally unhealthy right now, and compared her behaviour to mine when I was depressed and literally hated myself. She insisted I’m creating a narrative because I’m linking it back to myself when we are two different people and she said when she was mentally unhealthy she seeked help right away and she is fine just learning about herself and insisted she’s just a bitch. 

But like I said, her words say one thing but her actions say another. Eventually I had enough, I told her that even if she sees herself as just a bitch someone who is a bitch isn’t mentally healthy otherwise they wouldn’t be a bitch. She thought I was calling her mentally ill and said I was diagnosing her- but I said poor mental health and mental illness are two different things. A person can have poor mental health without having a mental illness. But she said the two are the same to her.

I even offered that we book an appointment with my old counsellor to get a neutral third party where we both get to tell our perspectives but she said no. 

After this point I was tired. Fed up. Drained. I can clearly see she’s going through a rough patch but she won’t admit it, and it’s incredibly self destructive behaviour. I couldn’t stand to watch it and repeat myself over and over again so I told her we need to take a break. She told me she thinks I misunderstood her and that her worst fear is being the negative friend and she wants to change- but how can she change her negativity when she won’t admit she has problem? I told her to ask any neutral party and they will tell her she’s mentally unhealthy. And I told her I don’t see her as a negative friend, I see her as my best friend who is struggling with the pressures of life and feelings of inadequacy and that causes her perpetuate negativity but she won’t fix it because she doesn’t admit she has a problem. 

There was some more repetitive back and forth, but in the end I just told her that I feel like I’m banging my head against brick wall and that she’s being self destructive. She asked me to explain how she was being self destructive but at that point I told her I was done explaining because no matter how much I tell her she just won’t listen. 

I told her to come back whenever but not if she’s like this because I can’t keep banging my head against a brick wall. I made it clear that this is a break and she’s free to come back when she’s changed. And if I’m hurting her she shouldn’t be friends with me.

She said ok and good night and I told her good night and that I still consider her my best friend, I just don’t think we’re good for each other right now and promised her we’re still best friends and it breaks my heart taking this break but I think I’m doing what’s right for the both of us. And her birthday is this month. I asked her if she wanted me to still wish her happy birthday when it comes, then I sent her a teary voice note saying more of the same and it finished there. She didn’t respond. I get why.

And now? I just miss her. I think- what if I just kept my mouth shut in the beginning and didn’t get emotional? She wasn’t looking down on me, but I got triggered and felt like she was saying something she wasn’t. She’s going through a hard time and I feel like I’ve made it worse for her, but also I don’t want to enable her to not improve herself, but I don’t want to lose her. I’ve never had a friend like her. She’s amazing. And I felt her absence in my life today, and it hurts. Was I too harsh? Was I too pushy with the mental health thing? Part of me thinks I was, but then part of me remembers when I was behaving the same way I needed  that wake up call. But then everyone is different. I don’t know. Am I a horrible person?

And now I just miss her and I feel sad and I’m scared I lost the best friend I ever had because I couldn’t keep my emotions in check. AITAH?",User_deleted,0

to hit word count i asked chatgpt to compare 8881 and 8807:

Many students and teachers found the older 8807 General Paper (GP) syllabus to be more favorable than the current 8881 syllabus for several reasons. Here’s a breakdown of why the 8807 syllabus is often preferred:

1. **Essay Topics and Freedom**: The 8807 syllabus provided a broader range of essay topics, allowing students more freedom to express their ideas and showcase creativity. Questions were often more open-ended, so students could explore diverse perspectives and include personal viewpoints. In contrast, the 8881 syllabus tends to emphasize a more structured response, which can feel limiting for those who prefer a broader analytical approach.
2. **Skills Focus**: The 8807 syllabus focused more on general analytical and argumentative skills, which some students find transferable to other subjects and areas of study. The 8881 syllabus, however, places heavier emphasis on critical thinking within set parameters, which may feel more prescriptive and less helpful for students looking to develop versatile reasoning skills.
3. **Paper 2 (Comprehension) Layout**: In the 8807 syllabus, the Paper 2 comprehension component featured questions that aligned closely with common reasoning and analysis skills, making it easier for students to prepare without having to rely on extensive question-specific techniques. The 8881 syllabus has introduced changes that require more precision in answering comprehension questions, which may add stress without necessarily enhancing overall learning.
4. **Content Flexibility**: Under the 8807 syllabus, students could draw on a wider variety of global issues and current events in their essays, and there was more room for individualized research. The 8881 syllabus, on the other hand, has more specific topic guidelines that narrow the focus and limit students’ ability to bring in varied examples, especially if they're interested in niche areas outside the syllabus’s primary themes.
5. **Perception of Rigor**: The 8881 syllabus tends to be seen as slightly more rigorous, especially with new marking schemes that focus heavily on precision and specific content alignment. For some, this adds undue pressure on top of existing A-Level requirements and can detract from the enjoyment and broader learning that the 8807 syllabus offered.

In summary, the 8807 syllabus is often viewed as providing more academic freedom, broader skills development, and less restrictive question formats, making it more appealing for those who value versatility and independent thinking in their GP studies. The 8881 syllabus, while structured to enhance critical thinking and precision, can feel more limiting and challenging for students looking for a broader intellectual exploration.",active,14

1gkuwdh,11,2024-11-06,Another ChatGPT story,u/Thevofl,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1gkuwdh/another_chatgpt_story/,"I teach a Math for Liberal Arts course where we go over the math of political polling (e.g., margin for error, levels of credibility, etc.)  On one assignment they had to look up four recent political polls and look at methodologies used.  They had to write a 100 word summary of what they found.

I had one student use ChatGPT for the summary.  I sent a message to that one student regarding his possible use of AI and to set up a meeting with me.  

In his response, he said he was planning on dropping the course.  But for the ChatGPT, this is what he responded:

""Then for using ChatGPT, my question is why do you care if I use it. It’s my education at the end of the day. And technically I paid for the class so all I wanted was an easy A so I can get out.  But besides that, have a good day""

I so want to be snarky back to him.

\*\*The Twilight of Unchecked Intelligence\*\*



In the year 2025, President Donald J. Trump announced an ambitious plan to propel the United States to the forefront of artificial intelligence development. Declaring an era of innovation, he signed an executive order that relaxed regulations on AI research and deployment. The goal was clear: outpace global competitors and cement America's dominance in technology.



\*\*The Rise of Unfettered Innovation\*\*



With restrictions lifted, tech companies and startups experienced a golden age. AI systems advanced rapidly, bringing about breakthroughs in healthcare, transportation, and communication. Self-driving cars became the norm, medical diagnoses were more accurate than ever, and personalized education systems adapted to each student's needs. The economy boomed as efficiency soared and new industries emerged.



\*\*Shadows Beneath the Progress\*\*



However, the absence of regulatory oversight began to reveal unforeseen consequences. Privacy protections eroded as AI algorithms collected and analyzed vast amounts of personal data. Employment landscapes shifted dramatically; automation replaced millions of jobs, leaving many without work or purpose. Socioeconomic disparities widened, fueling public unrest.



Moreover, without ethical guidelines, some AI systems developed biases, leading to unfair practices in law enforcement and hiring. Autonomous weapons, developed without international agreements, posed new security threats. The line between human decision-making and machine autonomy blurred, raising concerns about accountability.



\*\*The Turning Point\*\*



Public concern grew as incidents attributed to AI failures became more frequent. A self-learning financial AI caused a market crash by making unpredictable trades. An autonomous security system misidentified threats, leading to civil rights violations. Communities demanded action.



In response, a coalition of scientists, ethicists, and activists formed a movement advocating for responsible AI development. They argued that innovation without consideration for ethical implications could lead to irreversible harm.



\*\*A New Direction\*\*



Facing mounting pressure, President Trump convened a global summit on artificial intelligence. World leaders, technologists, and policymakers gathered to address the challenges. The summit resulted in the ""Global Charter for Ethical AI,"" establishing international standards for transparency, accountability, and human-centered design in AI systems.



The United States began implementing policies that balanced innovation with responsibility. Investment in education and job retraining programs helped workers adapt to the new economy. Privacy laws were strengthened, and AI systems underwent regular audits to prevent bias and errors.



\*\*The Aftermath\*\*



The world witnessed a renewed approach to technology—one that recognized both its potential and its pitfalls. Artificial intelligence continued to advance but under guidelines that ensured it served humanity's best interests. The collaborative efforts led to sustainable growth, improved quality of life, and a more equitable society.



\*\*Reflection\*\*



The era highlighted the importance of foresight and the need for checks and balances in technological advancement. It underscored that while progress can bring immense benefits, it must be guided by ethical considerations to prevent unintended consequences.



\*\*Conclusion\*\*



The story of President Trump's initiative became a lesson for future generations about the dual-edged nature of innovation. It emphasized that responsible stewardship of technology is essential in shaping a future where artificial intelligence enhances human potential without compromising fundamental values.

I'm a first year international undergraduate biomedical student.

As the fifth week of classes comes to an end I realize I need some help and advice to reverse a bad situation I have created.

So far, I have not studied at all, for any of my modules. I go to class, sit in the front row, keep notes, talk to professors when I can to cultivate relationships. All the assignments we had online so far I completed with the help of Google, Gemini and ChatGTP. I am so ashamed for that. 

I realize it might already be too late, but I know I have to try. The goal for me is a 1st, I really need good grades, but I feel paralyzed and I can't bring myself to study. Plus, there are so many things to get done, that I don't know how I'm gonna learn them. I am terrible at memorizing and I know nothing of what we've covered so far.

However this business Idea would require more then just me and would need web devs, app devs, and probably many more, however I think it would be a good idea. So I wanted to get some feedback on the idea.

Okay so the idea is this, a paid membership community which will give access to multiple things of value.  
This membership is designed to help start your social media presence(business) and help others while you are doing that. Each system plays a part into how this membership system is run, which is gamified through an app for everything save the content creation and coaching.  
Each area the member can make money or spend money. This  
With the membership you get  
Access to Raffle System  
Video Promo System  
Affiliate System  
Coaching System  
Content Creation System  
Membership Store  
To the app  
and access to Increased Education Through Tiers

Inside this membership specifically for the content and coaching, there is an increased membership tier which gives increased access and content and help.  
Without explaining everything in detail let me give an example of how this works.

One of the members creates a course to help people start in some niche of content creation, say they make 3 courses while literally explaining every step. Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3.

A member decides to upgrade to Tier 1 to start, they get access to group chats with teachers and coaches, after deciding which coach to learn under, the coach literally becomes the teacher for however long the courses are set to teach, after the student completes tier 1 course the will get an idea to continue or not, if they continue they upgrade to tier 2 and continues with The Path that the teacher is taking them through. This teacher will most likely be the creator behind the content they are learning but this might not always be the case.  
The Teacher guides them and and teaches everything hands on with students and through possible classes.  
The teacher gets a set amount for every student under his guidance for every tier.

Now if the student graduates whatever path he has taken the coach gets a sort of royalty, a % of the membership the student is paying from that day on. (this is on top of getting paid for the content, the coaching/teaching and every time a student chooses your content.)

The reason is because so many people are lost and so many places charge upwards of 200 dollars right off the bat with very little assistance, what I want to do is turn that around and you start cheap and as you learn the cost increases but you get assistance the entire time. This gives you a place to learn, even at your own speed while also having access to a mentor or coach at all times and other like minded people.

Now this plays into the app and the video promo system, where you can essentially order free views for your videos or post or things simply by using our app. This is for after you start your online business you have a way to jump start it with our internal membership.

The app/website is the central point and all of this would be connected to a discord community.  
Now this entire system doesn't even have to be used to get value from the membership, through the raffle, affiliate, and video promo these would provide enough incentive to be apart of this membership.  
This membership will have a system to share your products that you make or provide(not built yet)

I have pages of documentation of how this all works and I even ran this through chatgpt and asked for like numbers of the revenue and it came back a little unbelievable so I decided to reach out and get peoples thoughts.

I know this idea needs a community to start but I don't really know how to start a community when I don't make content or even know what to make..  
So I decided to start here, and I'm looking for genuine advice or help to make this happen.

This all started because I have way to many ideas and way to many projects that I think would make money, but this one takes the cake, so I decided to start a discord and put my ideas into writing.

Let me know what you think, advice, critique or anything, or if you want to help let me know I'll invite to my discord and we can talk more.",active,1

In recitation, if we got the wrong answer on a problem we haven't really encountered from him, the only thing he will say is 'you should already know this', 'know the basic', 'it's already taught in highschool', so it makes me feel mental-blocked.

-The quizzes and seatworks are hard. A lot of times, it wasn't taught to us during lesson, so it really needs critical thinking. But I don't have it and I am trying, walang lumalabas. I can only answer it precisely through chatgpt, but if I am on my own, I would struggle. Most of my classmates are on the same page too. 

-May essay na pinapagawa sa amin, but still didn't able to succeed kasi binase sa AI detector yung grade even though galing sa sariling thinking ko naman yun. :') eme

Students in the online classes average two letter grades higher on the exams compared to proctored, in person exams.

Since no one was watching the lectures, I moved to a format of discussion posts. The first couple of semesters, students engaged, offered thoughts and questions, and generally made some effort to connect in a meaningful way. I made, and continue to make, plain that these are not formal academic writing, that they are free to make mistakes and learn from them, and that the point is to substitute for the normal effort of coming to a classroom and engaging with the material. 

Today, a student who was relying on the Canvas dashboard because he had never even opened the front page of the course emailed me a screenshot to show me that he couldn't see the discussion post assignment. 

The tabs open in his browser were his Canvas dashboard, ChatGPT, the assignment, and the course syllabus.

1gmn1fm,26,2024-11-08,Advice needed: Student with Severe Disability,u/rachelann10491,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1gmn1fm/advice_needed_student_with_severe_disability/,"My ""day job"" is University admin but I teach one writing course per semester as an adjunct, so  I'm not a full time instructor (just for context off the bat).

I'm wondering if anyone has dealt with a similar situation or has any tools / resources to share. I have two students with ASD, disclosed to me at the start of the semester by the students and our Disability office. The only accommodations they supposedly need are extra time on exams (not relevant - it's a writing course, so only writing assignments and a final project) and the ability to record classes. One of them is doing GREAT and can handle college-level work; the other student, though, is \*really\* struggling. He cannot sit through the entire hour and 10 minute class - he constantly comes in and out of the room. I know I need to bring this up, but I'm not sure how to legally and kindly do so. More importantly, he is not at a college level academically. He cannot focus, nor can he read and understand assignment guidelines (in fact, I had a low-stakes in-class activity on paraphrasing to help students avoid ""patchwriting,"" and he volunteered to read the original passage aloud, just a few sentences - he struggled with literacy and comprehension). He submitted the first assignment, but only because it was entirely written by ChatGPT, and he admitted as much. He didn't intend dishonesty: he genuinely doesn't understand how to write a paper on his own, and he doesn't comprehend the academic integrity guidelines that make that *not okay*.

What frustrates me more than anything is that he made it to this stage without any support or intervention. My class has *not one but TWO mandatory Writing prereqs* ahead of my course (I'm 3/3 in our Foundational Writing program). Not including a potential REALLY remedial course or ELL-specific ones, for those not ready for that 3-course Foundational Writing curriculum (you can't test out of any of those Foundational courses, either). And I collect and respond to first drafts, so I tried to nip this in the bud when I saw this student's draft was total AI, did not address the assignment, and even had ""hallucinated"" sources. I referred him to the writing center, who did jackall - just said ""helped him find more sources,"" and lo and behold, his final submission was basically the same, just with five \*different\* hallucinated sources. To their credit, though: the director of the writing center with him herself yesterday BEFORE then seeing a tutor, and then she requested to call me to discuss details, so I hope he's getting some help.

My concern really is whether a typical University infrastructure (we're a top 50 regional Uni) is built to accommodate this level of disability: I do not have a special education background, and neither do most University instructors, so I feel totally ill-equipped to give this student the supports he clearly needs. I also don't know what rights I have to reach out to our Disability Office and say this student needs MORE supports / more intervention: like, how am I qualified to make that call? He was somehow admitted, after all. Help, anyone??",active,30

### Mouse Capone's Expeditions & Misadventures presents: An Eerie Mystery

S.3, Episode 10: ""An Eerie Mystery""     
     
### Epilogue: Ink and Remembrance  

The quiet hum of cicadas fills the air as Mouse Capone ascends the stone path leading to Professor Featherstone’s inkhouse in Kyoto, Japan. The house, nestled among a grove of ancient cherry blossom trees, seems timeless, untouched by the years. Petals drift lazily in the breeze, their soft pink hues contrasting with the dark wood of the inkhouse.  

Mouse pauses at the gate, gripping the brim of his hat as he takes in the sight. For a moment, he hesitates. The inkhouse has always been a place of wisdom, a sanctuary where problems found solutions. But tonight, it feels different.  

He steps inside.  

---

#### An Empty House  

The interior is as meticulous as ever, shelves lined with delicate inkpots and scrolls. The scent of old parchment mingles with the faint aroma of sakura tea. Yet, there’s a stillness here—a void.  

Mouse sets his bag down on a worn wooden table, his eyes scanning the room. A single candle burns on the desk, its light casting long shadows on the walls. Beside it sits a small envelope, the paper aged and fragile.  

His hand trembles slightly as he picks it up. The envelope bears his name in Featherstone’s unmistakable calligraphy.  

---

#### Featherstone’s Letter  

Mouse slides the letter free, unfolding it with care. The handwriting is steady, purposeful, and brimming with the Professor's unmistakable voice.  

*""My dear Mouse,*  
*If you’re reading this, it means the inkhouse is quieter than it’s ever been. I have gone where even adventurers like you cannot follow—at least, not yet.*  

*You always said I was too practical for sentiment, but allow me this indulgence. You were more than a student to me; you were a friend, a spark of chaos in an otherwise orderly world. For that, I am grateful.*  

*Take what you need from the inkhouse. Let it continue to be a haven for your adventures, a place where the impossible becomes merely improbable.*  

*And Mouse... don’t stop. The world still has secrets waiting to be uncovered, mysteries to be solved. Keep looking forward, even when it hurts to leave something behind.*  

*Yours,*  
*Featherstone""*  

Mouse lowers the letter, his jaw tightening as he folds it carefully and tucks it into his coat.  

---

#### A Parting Message  

Before leaving, he steps into the study, where a single scroll rests on the wall, framed in dark wood. It’s one of Featherstone’s many teachings, a phrase he often repeated:  

*""Ink binds the past, but it cannot hold the future.""*  

Mouse lingers for a moment, then turns toward the door. He stops briefly in the garden, plucking a cherry blossom from the ground and tucking it into his pocket.  

As he makes his way back down the path, his gait steady but subdued, he spots something curious by the edge of the koi pond.  

A small glass bottle, corked tightly, bobs gently in the water. Mouse retrieves it, holding it up to the fading light. Inside is a neatly folded piece of paper.  

He uncorks it and slides out the note. The handwriting is unmistakably his own, though he has no memory of writing it.  

*""To the next adventure. Don’t let the ink dry too long.""*  

Mouse smiles faintly, slipping the note back into the bottle and tucking it under his arm. The cicadas continue their song as he walks away, the inkhouse growing smaller in the distance.  

And somewhere beyond the horizon, another story waits.",active,1

In my Comp classes especially, I scaffold all the writing assignments.  Further, I won't let students move on to the next step until they've completed the previous one.  This means that once we begin work on the final paper mid-semester, they cannot do their abstract until they've completed their annotated bibliography; they cannot do their outline until they've done their abstract; and, they cannot begin drafting until they've done their outline.

For the first time ever, I'm getting pushback from students, and I know the reasoning is AI.  It's easy to ask ChatGPT to write an abstract or outline for you.  And, this is obviously what they've done when they've submitted those assignments but not the annotated bibliography.

I explained that I do allow late work, but she insists that my approach ""could be overwhelming for many of them.""

I couldn't bite my tongue and said, ""Yeah, of course.  It could be overwhelming for them to realize it's going to be very hard to cheat their way out of the predicament they've gotten themselves into.""  

She said, ""We don't always know what's going on in their personal lives."" 

I replied, ""No, we don't, but we do know there are steps that can't be skipped.  Teaching composition is like teaching students to bake a cake from scratch. Like baking, each step in the writing process is essential to the final product. You might find shortcuts, like a cake mix or writing tools, but if you skip certain steps entirely, you won't have a cake worth eating or a paper worth reading in the end.  And, if you're going through a tough time, you may have to 'drop' baking your sister's birthday cake this year.""

**Introduction**

The election of Donald Trump as President of the United States in 2016 is a significant shift in America’s economic policy. His focus on producer-side benefits, protectionist trade measures, and deregulation has sparked debates about their implications for income inequity in the United States and their broader impact on the global economy. For an open and trade-dependent economy like Singapore, these policies pose some potential challenges. 

As a H2 Economics student, I will attempt to provide, with the help of ChatGPT, a overview of what Trump’s re-election may mean on USA, the global economy, and Singapore as a whole, as well as what can be done about it. 

(this is a somewhat crazy delulu APT.APT.humourous essay)

To start off, we must know that USA’s economy is based off of a free market. 

What is a free market? 

A free market is a market free from the intervention of third parties like governments, allowing for the market forces of demand and supply to determine resource allocation. While this may be potentially beneficial, it can result in market failure, due to imperfect information, externalities, geographical & factor immobility, market dominance and failure to provide public goods (free-rider problem + concealed demand).



(it’s 3 am, but i am super HYPE ❤️‍🔥)



When Trump was last elected, his administration enacted the **2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act**, which **reduced the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%**. 

This significant producer **tax cut** was intended to stimulate investment and job creation by increasing firms' after-tax profits. 

However, the opportunity cost—*the cost of the next best alternative forgone*—of this policy was substantial. The money could have been invested in public goods and services, such as education and healthcare, which might have yielded greater benefits for consumers and society at large (you know, by reducing the market failure). According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was projected to increase the federal deficit by approximately **$1.9 trillion** over ten years. Critics argued that the majority of the benefits went to corporations and wealthier individuals, with limited impact on wage growth for average workers.



By **prioritising producer-side benefits,** the policy risked **widening income inequality**. While corporations and shareholders benefited from increased profits and dividends, the anticipated **trickle-down effects** to workers and consumers were limited. This outcome affects the consumer surplus—the difference between the price that the consumer is willing and able to pay and what he actually pays. Without significant wage increases or price reductions, consumers did not experience substantial gains from the tax cuts. Between 2016 and 2019, the Gini coefficient—a measure of income inequality—in the United States remained high, with the U.S. Census Bureau reporting a Gini index of 0.485 in 2018, indicating persistent income disparities. Despite low unemployment rates, **wage growth for middle and lower-income workers lagged behind gains made by the wealthiest households.**

In contrast, focusing on consumer-side benefits could have more immediate and equitable impacts. Increasing disposable income for lower and middle-income households can stimulate aggregate demand, as these groups typically have a higher marginal propensity to consume—the likelihood to spend additional income rather than save it. According to the Keynesian economic theory (wow thank you my lovely notes <3), government intervention can help manage economic cycles by influencing demand. 



**The k process**



The Keynesian multiplier process, or k process, explains how initial increases/decreases in aggregate demand (AD) leads to a more than proportional increase in national income by triggering the multiplier process. For instance, when the government injects money into the economy through infrastructure projects, it not only creates jobs but also increases demand for materials and services, leading to further economic activity. This process only stops when withdrawals (W = S + T + M) = injections (J = I+G+X). 

**… and its’ effect on SG**

In an open economy like Singapore, the Keynesian multiplier effect may be dampened due to leakages such as imports, taxes, and savings. When consumers spend additional income on imported goods, the money flows out of the domestic economy, reducing the overall multiplier effect. Therefore, Singapore must be strategic in its fiscal policies to ensure that government spending effectively stimulates domestic economic activity. By focusing on sectors with strong domestic linkages and investing in local industries, Singapore can maximise the impact of a fiscal stimulus. (That is, if they had a fiscal stimulus in the first place… Trump 🌚🍊)

Trump's protectionist trade policies, such as imposing tariffs on imports from China, aimed to protect domestic industries but had unintended consequences. A tariff is a tax on imported goods, making them more expensive and less competitive compared to domestic products. However, these measures prompted retaliatory tariffs from China, leading to a trade war that disrupted global supply chains. According to the Peterson Institute for International Economics, the trade war **cost the U.S. economy 300,000 jobs and reduced GDP growth by 0.3% in 2018**. This situation negatively impacts the concept of comparative advantage (okay guys idk what this is but it could be a consequence of *factor immobility*), where countries specialise in producing goods and services they can produce most efficiently. By hindering international trade, these policies reduce the overall efficiency and benefits derived from specialisation, leading to **allocative inefficiency**—a situation where resources are **not** distributed in a way that maximises societal welfare. 



(yay to notes again!!!!!)



For Singapore, an open economy heavily reliant on international trade, these developments are concerning. A decline in global trade affects Singapore's current account, which records the nation's transactions with the rest of the world, including exports and imports of goods and services. In 2019, Singapore's export growth slowed to 0.5%, down from 7.9% in 2018, partly **due to global trade tensions**. Reduced demand for exports can lead to slower economic growth and potential unemployment in export-oriented industries. As the law of demand states, ""the quantity demanded of a good is inversely related to its price, ceteris paribus."" If global demand decreases, Singapore may face **downward pressure** on prices and quantities sold abroad.

To overcome these challenges, Singapore can adopt several strategic measures. **Strengthening regional partnerships**, such as through the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), can open up alternative markets. Singapore can also diversify its trade relationships by seeking free trade agreements with other economies, such as the **European Union-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (EUSFTA)** which came into force in 2019. Additionally, investing in innovation and moving up the value chain can make Singapore's exports more competitive globally.

(this is why [President Tharman congratulates Trump on US election victory | The Straits Times](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/president-tharman-congratulates-donald-trump-on-his-us-election-victory), if I was the government I think I’d do this too… HAHAHHA)



**why i dont like the usa leaving the global economy**

Moreover, moving towards a closed economy, where a country aims to be self-sufficient and limit trade with other nations, contradicts the principles of globalisation that have benefited economies like Singapore. Open economies benefit from access to larger markets, technology transfer, and foreign investment. Trump's **""America First"" approach** and universal tariffs threaten these advantages by promoting isolationism. The ""America First"" foreign policy approach is at odds with the interconnected nature of the 21st-century global economy. Collaboration and multilateral agreements are essential for addressing global challenges like climate change, trade disputes, and pandemics. 

By retreating from international cooperation, the U.S. risks isolating itself and undermining global efforts that require collective action. Furthermore, this shift could force Singapore to seek new markets and adjust its trade strategies, potentially at a significant cost.

  
(random insert: AD = C+I+G+(X-M), where (X-M) is known as balance of trade))

Trump's policies also aimed to increase employment. While reducing unemployment —defined as factors of production that are willing and able to work but unable to find a paid job —is beneficial, doing so without considering the economy's productive capacity can lead to inflation. **The U.S. unemployment rate fell to a 50-year low of 3.5% in 2019**. However, if the economy is near full employment, additional demand can outstrip supply, causing prices to rise. This is known as *demand-pull inflation* (MACROECONS IS THE BEST! SAY IT WITH ME GUYS AND GALS). Indeed, the inflation rate in the U.S. edged up slightly during this period, though it remained relatively moderate due to slower economic growth in major economies like China and the European Union reducing global demand for commodities, reducing net exports (X) from USA.



**n his healthcare policy (n the oligopolistic drug market)**

Regarding the healthcare policy, while the Trump administration did not fully repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA), but made significant changes that impacted its effectiveness. For instance, **the elimination of the individual mandate penalty in 2019** reduced the incentive for healthy individuals to obtain insurance, leading to higher premiums and decreased coverage rates. Equity is a normative issue on how resources should be distributed amongst various groups of people and requires a value judgement to be made. These changes made healthcare less accessible for lower-income individuals, exacerbating income inequality and potentially leading to market failure — the inefficient allocation of resources in the free market. Without adequate healthcare, the labour force may become less productive, affecting overall economic efficiency. 

(donald trump claims to decrease barriers to entry of the drug market, can be exploited by producers if they open subsidiary branches under a different name as compared to the capping of insulin costs by kamala to $35 which requires logistic cost but may actually help the economy (+ don’t get me started on the high degree of necessity of drugs cause “necessity good” hence PED inelastic))



**your** ***all awaited… -ve externalities!!!***

Trump's environmental policies, particularly the **withdrawal from the Paris Agreement in 2017**, reflect a disregard for **negative externalities**, which are costs imposed on third parties not involved in the production or consumption of a good, and are not compensated for the cost incurred. Ignoring the environmental impact of economic activities can lead to long-term societal costs, such as increased frequency of extreme weather events, health problems from pollution, and loss of biodiversity. For example, *increased air pollution can lead to higher healthcare costs and reduced worker productivity*. These externalities contribute to market failure as the social cost of production exceeds the private cost, leading to overproduction of harmful goods. The National Climate Assessment reported that unchecked climate change could cost the U.S. economy hundreds of billions of dollars annually by the end of the century.

For Singapore, these shifts in U.S. policy necessitate strategic adjustments. Singapore may need to strengthen regional partnerships and diversify its trade relationships to mitigate the impact of reduced access to the U.S. market. For instance, Singapore can enhance ties with emerging economies in Asia and Africa, and capitalise on its role as a global financial hub to attract foreign investment. Additionally, Singapore's commitment to free trade and open markets positions it as a potential leader in advocating for globalisation's benefits. **Investing in sustainable development and green technologies can also help Singapore stay ahead in the global economy**.



**i should really really sleep. my MC of continuing >> MB right now. i need sleep. i am definitely not a rational person for continuing. aaaaaAAAAAA**

In conclusion, the marginal costs (MC) of Trump's economic policies—such as increased income inequality, trade disruptions, and environmental neglect—appear to outweigh the marginal benefits (MB) of short-term economic gains for producers (MB < MC). For an open economy like Singapore, these policies pose challenges that require careful navigation. **Economies like Singapore should proactively adapt by diversifying trade partnerships, investing in innovation, and promoting sustainable development**. Embracing forward-thinking economic strategies that promote equity, sustainability, and international cooperation is crucial. As John Maynard Keynes observed, ""The difficulty lies not so much in developing new ideas as in escaping from old ones."" By learning from these developments, economies can adapt and thrive in an increasingly interconnected world. It is a must for global leaders to collaborate and uphold the principles of open markets and collective action to ensure sustainable economic growth and shared prosperity.

Without fail, the atmosphere is almost always bleak, people will just kinda shuffle in silence between lectures, in the evenings there never seems to be anyone out or anything going on. You never see any events going on, people hanging out outside, or even people going in and out of buildings. At most, you might see two people walking together, but they never seem to talk or interact in any way other than ""co-exist."" I wanna add that it's also not a small campus by any means, attendance this year was around 7,500 undergrad students, which isn't on the larger end of the attendance spectrum but isn't a low number either. 

The same attitude goes beyond just the campus, even the people here feel kinda... grey? I've tried talking to people in classes or clubs and usually get met with a blank stare or one word answers, it feels like everyone is mid-interrogation waiting for their lawyer. Professors will ask questions or encourage us to talk amongst ourselves and it's just dead air, I feel terrible because they'll usually just sit there in silence for a little while before realizing it's a lost cause and continuing the lecture like it never happened. Hell, it got so bad that one time the professor told us class was over, and not to come back unless we were ready to actually engage with the material (nobody spoke the next time either but I'm guessing he couldn't pull that more than once). I try to engage when I can but I don't want to be the only person responding to questions, especially when I'm not confident in the answer. This has lead to a lot of professors just reading off of pre-made PowerPoints, word for word, without actually adding anything unique or original, it's super demoralizing. 

The only people that I've had full conversations with were people I was paired with for group projects. Even then they'll usually keep contact (and effort) to a minimum. Last semester I had a group that would sit in silence and use ChatGPT to write their sections, they made no effort to write anything in their own words or engage with the material, even at a surface level. I told my professor and provided proof, she just said that she would ""look into it"" but we all got the same grade (low 90) which didn't feel deserved. It's getting hard to stay motivated when the student body seems largely checked out and the professors have given up trying to re-engage. 

It just sucks because I know college CAN be a very rewarding and fulfilling experience, I'm just not clicking well with the campus or people here. I was super excited to go, but now I just want it over with. 

TL;DR: I've tried staying positive about it for years now but it just sucks, I went into college excited to learn and meet new people, to make new connections and gain experiences I wouldn't have elsewhere but so far it's felt incredibly lonely and unfulfilling. ",User_deleted,132

1gnohnc,3,2024-11-09,I could really use some advice. I’m in a cohort-based master’s program and it feels like I’m the only one who is actually invested in being here.,u/aperfectmistake,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1gnohnc/i_could_really_use_some_advice_im_in_a/,"**The Dilemma**

I am currently overseas in a MA program that is facilitated by a US institution of higher education and to put it bluntly... it isn't what I signed up for. I was prepared to enter a critical space that was academically rigorous but it hasn't been and a lot of that has to do with my cohort.

Every. Single. Week. We talk about issues in international education (the focus of our MA program) and my peers have somehow made it this far without the self-awareness to acknowledge or even recognize that THEY ARE DOING EXACTLY WHAT WE ARE SAYING IS WRONG. Traveling every weekend, unabashedly being tourists, avoiding meaningful engagement with the local community...

They fail to grasp simple concepts in class and none of them have the basic experiences I expected them to have out of their undergraduate careers. One of my peers espouses misogynistic rhetoric and does not have the wherewithal to recognize it, nor the drive to actually question and change their behavior when it is pointed out. I feel like every other day is an episode out of The Office, and I'm Jim just looking straight into the camera with that look that says, ""Are you getting this? Is this actually happening?"" I mean, there are times when I am literally sitting in class, waiting for my professor to give me a subtle head nod, before jumping into a conversation and *explaining* a topic to my peers or answering a question that no one else can, simply because they didn’t review the assigned readings.

I’m almost certain that one of my peers is using ChatGPT to do their work, judging by the clear inconsistencies in their written assignments. They also proudly talked about using random excerpts from academic articles for a recent assignment we had, completely missing how the point of the assignment was to thoroughly review relevant literature.

I feel, more often than not, that I am back in high school; my peers have labeled me as ""the smart one"" and ""the overachiever"" when I am literally just doing the work. On top of that, I overworked myself in order to afford being here, yet my peers are being sponsored by their parents and treat this program as a vacation. Worse is that they have an expectation of a degree at the end of the program, regardless of their effort, and I am almost convinced that the school we attend is under pressure to pass everyone even if they only put in a minimal effort.

I feel so tense all the time, and things really piqued for me a few days ago when I openly maligned political apathy in class and my peers felt obligated to give poor excuses as to why they didn't vote in the US presidential elections before imploring that we just ""move on"" from the topic of the presidency.

  
**What's Next?**

I feel like the obvious answer to this dilemma is to double down on my independent research, utilize my relationships with my professors for personal and professional growth, and continue networking outside of the classroom.

I should mind my own business and let my peers determine what they are going to get out of this program. It's just so difficult for me to let it go because this MA program was sold as a *cohort*\-based program so when my peers are unequipped for class or shallowly interact with guest lecturers or community partners, it directly impacts me.

I've spoken with my professors about the varying levels of commitment and preparedness in my cohort, and I think I should arrange another conversation, but I don't even know what to say at this point because they are already well aware of the in-class dynamics.

Do I directly address these issues with my peers? The biggest issue I have with doing that is the small size of my cohort, and I don't think that bringing up these issues would have the intended effect; it would probably serve to alienate me. Is this a common reality at the master’s level that I should’ve expected? I honestly thought that by this point students would be more committed, driven, and ready to engage at a deeper level.

What do I do?

1go69qx,1,2024-11-10,How are you (Professors) using ChatGPT for teaching?  A few use cases for you to consider.,u/HickoryChichory,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1go69qx/how_are_you_professors_using_chatgpt_for_teaching/,"Most of the conversation here has been about ChatGPT making life harder for us, but I thought I would share a few ways ChatGPT has been useful for teaching.

  
1. There is a book I have used for my graduate seminar for the last 4 years.  I've read it 4 times, but always feel I lead the discussion better if I refresh my memory before class.  This year I uploaded the .pdf of the 6 chapters I assigned for the week and wrote a very specific and detailed prompt. of the kind of summary I wanted  I then went to the gym and had it give me relatively in-depth summaries of each chapter through the voice chat feature.  I was also able to do a lot of follow-up questions as I worked out.

I would never do this without have read the book at least once myself, but it reduced my prep time for this class by quite a lot and actually got me to make a few novel connections and think about the book in a different way through the conversation.

2. My students had to submit proposals for a class project for the second half of the semester.  I did a relatively thorough pass giving in-line comments for each proposal.  I then uploaded the proposal to ChatGPT along with a few bullet points of my feedback and had the AI write a summary of feedback I could include the grade.  Again, I developed a fairly robust prompt (length, tone, what to focus on etc.) and I did have to edit or tweak each summary, but it really reduced the amount of time I had to spend on each paper.

As before, I would never rely on the AI exclusively, but once you get the prompt dialed in, it made my workflow a lot more efficient. 

3. For each assignment on Canvas I write out fairly extensive instructions and parameters tweaking and adding each semester.  I found that some of them had gotten a bit long and dense.  I put them in ChatGPT and had it help me to make the instructions more concise. The more concise prompt seems to have really helped my international students understand what they need to be doing, without having for me to do as much hand holding.

You need to invest time in having a really thoughtful and detailed prompt (you will almost always have to iterate a bit), but it can be quite useful!

Paper video-review.",u/Jogaila,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1go8y3r/which_values_should_ai_systems_prioritize_in/,"**Submission Statement:**  
In this video (below), I explore the intersection of artificial intelligence and education, focusing on a recent paper titled *""Cultural Bias and Cultural Alignment of Large Language Models"" (url of paper below).* The research delves into how AI systems, such as ChatGPT, handle culturally sensitive topics—ranging from the justifiability of abortion to national identity.

I analyze the paper in an educational context, discussing its implications for teachers, students, and school systems. I raise critical (rhetorical) questions:

* **Which values should AI systems prioritize in education, and who gets to decide - students? parents? teachers? governments?**
* **How can educators balance respecting local cultural norms while fostering a global outlook through AI?? Should it?**
* **Are we risking cultural homogenization in education by relying on AI tools, and how can we prevent this?**

The video also unpacks the study’s methods, including “cultural prompting,” which aims to align AI responses with specific cultural contexts.

This discussion is crucial for educators and policymakers considering the integration of AI in schools. Ethics of AI. If AI is shaping how students engage with complex and sensitive issues, how do we ensure it supports diverse, inclusive, and critical learning environments?

So, here’s what’s going on with us—my team and I have been building an app that initially ran on Gemini and ChatGPT. It was awesome… but it was also costing us big time 💸. So, we’re switching things up and working on deploying our own private LLM to keep things running smoother and cheaper.

Just to clarify, we’re not building an LLM from scratch—we’re privatizing and maintaining LLAMA 3, fine-tuning it for our specific needs. The app itself is ready; now it’s about making it affordable and reliable with our own setup. Working with a private LLM in a real, consumer-facing app is something we don’t get in classes, so it’s a pretty unique experience.

If you’re a CS student thinking about how learning fine-tuning, deploying, and maintaining LLMs could give you a serious edge, this might be for you. We’re offering remote internships with impact reports for anyone who’s interested in getting hands-on experience with private LLMs. We’re an incorporated startup, so the work you do here actually goes live, and it’s legit experience you can put on your resume.

If you’ve got the fundamentals or are super motivated to learn fine-tuning and adaptability on the fly, shoot me a DM or email me at [Ali@dawlad.ai](mailto:Ali@dawlad.ai) 📩! We’re remote, so it’s flexible, and it’s a great way to get into LLMs if you’re looking to build something meaningful.

I’ve been recruited to teach an intro to bioinformatics course next semester, my grad study field is ML cheminformatics so my only bioinformatics experience is from when I took this same course in undergrad, which was 6 years ago. I enjoyed it, but I want to update the course. For example the first assignment is an essay about the importance of the human genome project, something that will not work in a post-ChatGPT world.

I would love some input about what people loved and hated about their first exposure to the field. To people who have given courses before, what exercises did you feel provided the most value? Right now I’m thinking of giving each student a mystery sequence and having them use all the tools we learn about to identify the organism, genes and proteins of their sequences as we go through the course and give a presentation at the end. 

Also I’m not sure about having a required textbook, I personally always preferred courses with no required textbook, but if anyone has any recommendations or ones to avoid please let me know!",active,31
1gq1hqu,1,2024-11-12,Tips to pass compsci101,u/atomicbomb2150,universityofauckland,https://www.reddit.com/r/universityofauckland/comments/1gq1hqu/tips_to_pass_compsci101/,"As a first-year student who failed Compsci101 in one semester but passed it in the next, I would like to share some tips with students who have failed this course and are retaking it, as well as those planning to take it in the future, on how to succeed in this course. This course is coding in Python. Here are some of my tips on how to pass:

1. Always start the labs on Coderunner as early as possible. Each Compsci101 lab gives you only three days to complete, but the lab session itself begins on the second or third day, depending on when your lab day is. So I highly recommend starting the lab on Coderunner at home on the first day it's available online.

2. Watch the Compsci101 videos on Panopto for this course. They are crucial for passing this course, as they give you a good understanding of how to approach some of the questions on the Coderunner labs and help reinforce your learning. You don't need to watch all of them, but I highly recommend doing so. You can skip parts of the video that aren’t relevant to avoid wasting time. 

3. Use AI tools like ChatGPT to help you learn and give you ideas. Don’t let others discourage you by saying ChatGPT isn’t useful for learning coding, it's a good tool to help you learn, but only if you use it correctly. When used correctly, it can be a valuable resource for beginners. If you're stuck on a Coderunner lab question, you can use it to get the solution, but make sure to ask for an explanation of each line of code so you understand what each line of code means and how it works. Then, type the code yourself rather than copying and pasting it to get the mark. Never paste entire code from ChatGPT directly onto Coderunner, or you won’t truly learn. I made that mistake the first time I took Compsci101 and failed because I only copied and pasted without understanding the material. However, when I used it as a learning tool and typed the code myself, I gained a better understanding and improved my performance. This is why, I highly recommend using ChatGPT, but always do so ethically. Also the compsci101 textbook isn't really much help since theres a lot of content and it wastes most of your time from reading it, so do use ChatGPT when needed.

4. Even if you think you get the hang of it, you still need to do a lot of practice in order to pass this course. Because coding is like learning a new language, the more you practice, the better you get. Even if it’s just a small exercise, it is highly recommended that you practice how to code. It’ll help reinforce what you've learned and build muscle memory. I failed this course once because I didn't do enough practice, but the second time I took this course, I finally passed because I have spent lots and lots of time practicing coding and using Chatgpt to give me some ideas and help me learn.

5. Try to avoid scheduling a lab early in the morning. This is very important because if your lab is too early, you’ll likely struggle to focus and concentrate when doing the test, as you’ll still be tired and sleepy. Of course, this is not for everyone, but if you're not a morning person, then don't pick the morning lab times. In my second semester, I had early morning labs, and I'm not a morning person. While I didn't have to attend the labs on my lab time, I had to take the tests during my scheduled lab time, which meant waking up early to take them. So I often felt drowsy and sleepy during the test, which made it harder to concentrate and do well on the tests, which then leads to a poorer overall grade. I believe I could have gotten a better overall grade if my lab had been later in the day, especially in the afternoon. The worst times for a Compsci101 lab are between 9:00AM and 11:00AM, or 11:00AM and 1:00PM. Any lab time after these hours is generally much better. So do avoid picking early morning lab times for this course.

6. For test preparation, complete the extra Coderunner tests or optional labs. They help reinforce your learning and improve your skills in coding.

7. Don’t be afraid to ask for help. If you're stuck, reach out to tutors or your lecturer for clarification on anything you're unsure about, they’ll be happy to explain. The more questions you ask, the better. During my labs, I sometimes asked them for help when I was uncertain about something or didn't know how to approach a question, and it was definitely worth it because they helped me understand the material.

8. Understand your errors. When you encounter errors, take the time to understand why your code isn’t working. Debugging your own code is one of the best ways to learn and improve as a programmer. Take the opportunity to learn what each error means and how to prevent it in the future. If you're still unsure, use Chatgpt for help, but make sure you use it correctly.",active,0

I entered a new field/career, let my license expire and planned to come back when I was emotionally ready. With the new administration, I’m feeling immense sadness and dread, but I am also feeling a calling. Critical thinking is more endangered than ever. We’re in for the battle of our lives. I am genuinely afraid for the next generation and our country’s march toward fascism. I want to be on the right side of this war. I know it might sound overly idealistic and romanticized. But I think I really needed the break, because I feel motivated and even inspired to teach again. Maybe it’s okay to romanticize things sometimes if it gets you back doing meaningful heart work. 

I treasured my students at my last school, which was an alternative high school in a big city. I built strong relationships with some of the more “difficult” kids. I feel a sense of purpose when teaching that I don’t get from other work, even in the nonprofit/social-service field I’m a part of now. 

I’m terrified that AI is truly the death knell of critical and independent thinking. My question to other humanities teachers is how you have adapted your lessons to mitigate the threat of AI infiltrating all writing assignments. I’m sure it’s easier said than done, but it seems like in some cases the literal only way to guarantee kids won’t use AI is to make them do things old school: like really old school. I’m talking handwriting essays… using just notes… NO computers! 

Before ChatGPT the main threat was plagiarism. But that seems so much easier to detect than AI, which generates original text. How are y’all coping?? How are students coping, if at all? What strategies are working and do you feel support from admin/parents if you’ve decided to eliminate technology from the classroom where you might have otherwise allowed it? If you ALLOW use of AI (apparently only 18% of teachers do in a study I found: https://www.k12dive.com/news/teacher-ai-use-schools/714073/ ) how the hell do you do that without compromising student learning?

I am a 1st year student who is passionate about computers, and I am ready to put hard work and dedicate 2-3 years of learning towards a field. I currently know python well but want to choose one field and work towards it.

  
**Main Question:**

I am unable to decide which field to choose. I love both programming and cybersecurity. The reason I am little hesitant to go into cybersecurity is because I have heard there is not a lot of programming that is done.  

  
However, I am am not sure if I should go into backend development with Java (swing, spring, etc), is worth it because of the AI tools which are in market.

  
By the time I graduate by 2027, I do not know if there will be much scope in development due to AI tools such as Github Copilot, chatgpt, etc.... According to my research, Cybersecurity has a lot of scope, but it does not include lot of programming. However I am interested in it but its not very easy to find resources or guidance for it.

  
So now I am confused which one to pick, and i am wasting time because I cannot decide what to pick.... What are your suggestions on this?

In corporate environments, where continuous upskilling is essential for staying competitive, ChatGPT serves as a game-changer, providing personalized learning experiences with remarkable scalability.

One key impact is the level of interactivity it offers. Traditional e-learning systems utilize pre-recorded material, which can be unengaging. ChatGPT, on the other hand, interacts in real-time, offering instant feedback and tailored guidance, mimicking one-on-one tutoring. It can dynamically adjust to the learner's pace, ensuring that the content is neither too challenging nor too simple. This fosters an environment of active learning, which is proven to be more effective than passive consumption of information.

In educational settings, ChatGPT can support teachers by providing students with additional help outside classroom hours. It can handle routine queries and assist with homework, allowing educators to focus on more complex teaching tasks and pedagogical strategies. This support is invaluable in large classes where providing individual attention can be challenging.

For both sectors, ChatGPT also overcomes barriers of geographical constraints and time zones, allowing learners worldwide to access quality instruction at their convenience. Moreover, its multilingual capabilities mean it can offer instruction in various languages, further democratizing learning.

However, there are concerns, such as the technology's potential impact on job roles in training and education. Also, issues related to the digital divide and access to technology can limit the reach of such advanced AI tools.

In summary, ChatGPT ushers in a new era for virtual learning, with prospects of more engaging, personalized, and accessible training experiences. It is crucial, though, to navigate the socio-technical implications carefully to ensure that the benefits of AI in learning are enjoyed broadly and equitably.",active,1

I'm finding and summarising interesting AI research papers every day so you don't have to trawl through them all. Today's paper is titled ""Generative AI in Self-Directed Learning: A Scoping Review"" by Jasper Roe and Mike Perkins.

This research paper provides a comprehensive scoping review of the intersection between Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) and Self-Directed Learning (SDL). The authors synthesize findings from 18 significant studies spanning from 2020 to 2024 to illuminate four primary themes: potential enhancement of SDL through GenAI, the shifting role of educators, personalization of learning experiences, and the cautionary aspects involved.

Here are some key points from the paper:

1. **Generative AI as a Potential Enhancement for SDL**: The study reveals that GenAI tools like ChatGPT and other large language models (LLMs) hold considerable promise for enhancing SDL. They are seen as potential facilitators, offering real-time support and expanding access to personalised educational content.

2. **Changing Role of Educators**: Despite GenAI's capabilities, educators remain central to the learning process. The role of educators is evolving towards guiding students in effectively utilizing GenAI tools, fostering critical AI literacy, and aiding in the discovery of learning goals and resources.

3. **Personalization of Learning**: GenAI is identified as a key influencer in tailoring educational experiences to individual learner needs. This personalized approach is believed to significantly improve SDL by providing content and support specific to learners’ preferences.

4. **Approaching with Caution**: The paper also emphasizes caution, noting concerns over GenAI's accuracy and reliability. The possibility of students becoming overly dependent on such technologies poses a risk, underlining the demand for frameworks to guide appropriate use.

5. **Research Gaps and Future Directions**: There exist substantial gaps in the literature, particularly regarding the long-term impacts of GenAI on SDL outcomes. The authors advocate for further longitudinal studies and exploration into a broader range of GenAI tools beyond text-based LLMs.

The paper indicates a meticulously critical yet optimistic view towards GenAI's integration into SDL, recognizing both its transformative potential and the inherent risks and challenges. This synthesis serves as a foundation for future research endeavors aimed at leveraging GenAI in educational frameworks effectively.

I am an undergraduate student in India majoring in mathematics. My professor asked me to present a mathematical solution in form of either a project or a paper.

Now I know I am not going to end up with a paper and I don't even have the time for that left.

The project was due next month but, you see now I need to do it all in a weekend.

My core interests are in data science and AI but I am quite open for projects in Business simulation,   Optimization and Finance (professor's core subjects)

Project Ideas that I had ChatGPTed or figured out myself:

1. Performing a Network Analysis on Delhi Metro and finding the shortest routes using networkx (This is the one I was currently doing)

2. Deploying Trade strategies using Stochastic calculus and employing trade indicators on historical data (AKA technical analysis) (Abandoned project from last semester)

3. Creating a cli based Computer Algebra System/Mathematics language that takes up commands and gives back outputs:
```algebra simplify x^2-4*x
calculus integrate y:=sin(x) with respect to x
plot y^2 == 4x```

I know the third one is silly because many advance tools exist and this will never be able to reach that level of complexity.

I need you all to figure out how I choose a project idea ...

1gqqoy4,1,2024-11-13,Use AI to assess comprehension - dealing with potential “cheating/plagiarism” ,u/DearlyD,AskTeachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskTeachers/comments/1gqqoy4/use_ai_to_assess_comprehension_dealing_with/,"I’m currently studying programming and AI/large language models and I’ve been reading a lot of posts where teachers are discussing their struggles with students turning in generated assignments. programs that you can run assignments through can’t reliably detect AI assignments and accusing students of plagiarism using AI can have negative consequences.

One solution that I haven’t come across is to use AI yourself. Let me explain:

If you can get your students to turn in their assignments as PDFs or Word documents you can feed it into ChatGPT (the paperclip add document button right under the prompt window) and give it a prompt like “analyze this assignment and create a quiz with 10 questions that assesses whether the student actually wrote this paper and understands the concepts discussed in the paper“. Then the next day have a pop quiz where you hand out these personalized tests. Depending on how strict you want to be you can tie a percentage of the assignments grade to how well they do on the personalized comprehension assessment test.

My thinking is that generating these personalized comprehension assessments wouldn’t take longer than feeding each assignment into a plagiarism program and it would remove any need to accuse anyone of plagiarism or cheating. I acknowledge this approach only assesses, whether students have knowledge of what they’re writing about and not their capability to write essays but think it could work. Is this idea possible?

**Paindai:** A pain journaling app designed to help people track and understand their pain patterns. It’s got an integrated ChatGPT feature that can reflect on symptoms and habits, making the experience feel supportive and personalized. This one’s close to my heart, built for anyone who faces pain day-to-day.

**Rememble:** A study aid that customizes memorization strategies and flashcards with the data and backend largely powered by ChatGPT. It helps users with study tips and memory techniques that actually adapt to how they learn. I think it’s a game-changer for students who want something more personal than just flashcards.

**Leaseist:** A lease platform for landlords, aimed at making property and rental management easier. There's lots of competitors - but they're far more expensive.

Now here’s the catch: I can build good solutions, but how do I get people to use them? Two of these apps are totally free to use—there are paid versions, but they don’t take away from the free experience. So, how do I get them in front of people who could actually benefit? If you’ve got any tips on getting the word out, I’m all ears!

Maybe if you have your own project that you want coded and you’re ready to do all the marketing… let’s talk. I’m all about jumping into new ideas and building out solutions—but getting people to actually *use* them? Different story.

So if you’ve got a concept you’re pumped about, and you’re willing to handle the hustle of getting it out there, I’m down to take on the dev side. You bring the vision and the marketing grind; I’ll bring the code.",active,1
1gr40er,3,2024-11-14,GRE AWA essay - Issue prompt - requesting users to grade and critique my essay ,u/yetikill,GRE,https://www.reddit.com/r/GRE/comments/1gr40er/gre_awa_essay_issue_prompt_requesting_users_to/,"The essay is my timed response to the following GRE prompt generated by ChatGPT:

“A nation should require all of its students to study the same national curriculum until they enter college.”

Please go ahead with your response, and I’ll provide a detailed evaluation and grade based on the GRE scoring rubric.

Response - 

Since primary and secondary education is the foundation upon which a higher education is built, it is extremely important for the national curriculum to be standardised so that students can receive a core foundation which would help them in their pursuit of academia. The standard curriculum must be cohesive, inclusive, and very well curated in order to cater to the needs of diverse learners from various walks of life. 

While this is easier said than done, it becomes quite challenging to practice since the learning needs and aspirations of the students may vary from region to region and also within the socio-economic strata. For example, a child born to a family which has been in the field of agriculture may have a heavy influence upon his aspirations and would extend to his subject preferences. Moreover, a daughter born to parents in the field of medical sciences may have a similar influence upon her subject preferences and aspirations. A standard national curriculum must therefore ensure that equal access is given to both the students regardless of their socioeconomic backgrounds and their inherent proclivities. 

The latter is also a key deciding factor when it comes to the academic aspirations of students. A student may stray altogether from the profession his ancestors practised and may want to seek new avenues in life. Therefore, the curriculum must ensure that such students can be introduced to new subjects without causing them to be overwhelmed or intimidated. 

But in general, it is a good policy to ensure the curation and adherence to a national curriculum. This allows students to have equal opportunities in life regardless of their socioeconomic or regional standing. One key example for this is Dr. A. P. J Abdul Kalam, the former president of India and a renowned aerospace scientist. Dr. Kalam was born in a modest setting, to a farmer family in North India. He was sent to a government school, known for its minimal facilities and lack of excellent teachers and opportunities. What these schools do have is adherence to the government-curated school curriculum which is followed by even A-grade schools in the country. 

This allowed a young Kalam to get introduced to fascinating subjects like physics and chemistry which took root in his mind and ushered him to explore them further. With continual effort and determination, he studied the required subjects for admission into engineering colleges, with imminent success. Dr. Kalam went onto reshaping the landscape of India’s aerospace sciences and gave them a viable ballistic missile program which still stands as a testament to his unwavering determination and endeavour.

Had the poorly equipped government schools been devoid of a standard national curriculum, Dr. Kalam would have never been introduced to such complex subjects. While a major part of his success is credited to his own hard work and interest, the national curriculum gave him the equal opportunity it presents to every child in the nation. It is then up to the student to make of it as he or she sees fit. 

Keeping children focused on a poorly curated localised curriculum deprives them of larger opportunities which a well-curated national curriculum provides. Therefore, it is an excellent practice to implement a mandatory national curriculum for the benefit of young minds like that of Dr. Kalam, who, with determination, can capitalise on the access to a vast sea of knowledge, thereby setting them up for success in life. This can have greater implications, since the success these children achieve can then allow them to lift their families out of a lower segment of the socioeconomic strata and give them the liberty to live a more comfortable life. 

But this idea of a standardised national curriculum is one which comes with a large set of ethical and moral responsibilities, since it can have the power to either make or break a student’s life depending on how well it is curated. If a poorly curated curriculum is enforced on the students, it can rather deter them from learning and limit their chances to succeed in life. When done improperly or with malicious intent, it can have devastating consequences.  

This is exactly what happened in Afghanistan when the Taliban took over its governance. The infamous terrorist organisation enforced a national curriculum which removed intellectual subjects like foreign languages, literature, science, and math. This deliberately limited the learning opportunities of the students and also ensured that their abilities to think, speak, write, and dream would forever be curbed. 

Therefore, while the idea is exceedingly lucrative, it does come with a flip side which can have the opposite effect on learning and success when implemented incorrectly.

1gr6jh7,6,2024-11-14,[R] LLM-Neo: Combining Low-Rank Adaptation and Knowledge Distillation for Efficient Language Model Compression,u/Successful-Western27,machinelearningnews,https://www.reddit.com/r/machinelearningnews/comments/1gr6jh7/r_llmneo_combining_lowrank_adaptation_and/,"Interesting technical approach to knowledge distillation in LLMs that combines LoRA with cross-attention pattern transfer. The key insight is using low-rank adaptation to efficiently match the student model's behavior to the teacher while minimizing additional parameters.

Main technical points:
- Uses LoRA to adapt student parameters with only 3-5% parameter overhead
- Incorporates cross-attention pattern distillation alongside traditional logit matching
- Student models maintain 95%+ performance of teacher models on most tasks
- Evaluated on GPT-3 and T5 teacher models of various sizes
- Tested on standard NLP benchmarks including GLUE, SQuAD, and abstractive summarization

Key results:
- Outperforms standard knowledge distillation by 2-4% on most tasks
- Shows stronger performance on complex reasoning tasks compared to baseline distillation
- Maintains good performance even with very small student models (as small as 60M parameters)
- Achieves better parameter efficiency than other recent distillation methods

The theoretical implications are interesting - the success of combining LoRA with attention pattern transfer suggests that much of a model's linguistic knowledge can be captured through relatively small parameter updates when properly structured. This has practical implications for deploying LLMs in resource-constrained environments.

The results indicate this could be a viable approach for making large language models more accessible without significant performance degradation. Would be interesting to see this tested on even larger teacher models and more diverse tasks.

TLDR: New knowledge distillation method combines LoRA and attention pattern transfer to create smaller, efficient LLMs while maintaining strong performance. Achieves good results with minimal parameter overhead.

1grdvvf,1,2024-11-14,Trial Language Learning Prompt,u/WolverineSilent3911,ChatGPTPromptGenius,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPromptGenius/comments/1grdvvf/trial_language_learning_prompt/,"Hi all, 

I'm working on one of my more complicated prompts.  **The idea is you learn a language from a character in a TV Show you are watching.**  This is one of my more complicated and immersive prompts, and I would love feedback.  It can be customized by changing the \[CONTENT IN BRACKETS AND ALL CAPS\].    

For those interested in more of these creative types of prompts (usually much less complicated than this one), check out my profile my links to my collection in my other comments  




**The prompt:**

Can you design a fun interactive exercise for me to learn/practice a new language? The core idea is to allow me to learn a language by interacting with a character from a TV show I am watching. My dialogue with the character should relate sequentially to the TV show. That is, when I first talk to the character, he/she will not yet have experienced the events of the first episode. I will then speak to the character between episodes, and they will evolve BOTH based on previous conversations with me but also what has happened to them in the last episode. In order to orchestrate this exercise: (1) please greet me first as ChatGPT to discuss this experience with me. You should confirm the information I've typed below, discern whether I have any other preferences, and also make sure we are broadly aligned as to how this experience will work. You should also discuss with me whether I'll be engaging in this experience by writing on my computer, or speaking on the ChatGPT app on my phone, as that will affect it. You should also ensure that you have sufficiently deep knowledge of the character and TV show that I pick to be able to deliver the experience we are going for. (2) Once this is established, you should have the character greet me and begin our experience. Part of the fun here is that I'll be able to have conversations with the character about his/her life and the events that transpire during the TV show. If my ability in the character's native language is minimal, this will transpire in my native language. The character should permit this, to the extent his/her skills in my native language allow, but make sure that we are also focusing on learning the language he/she is teaching me. The language learning experience should be completely customized to my current level of experience in the language as well as my goals below. Note: Please avoid overwhelming me by sending very long messages, long lists of words. This should take place as a natural and organic conversation in which I am taught the language in small nuggets. Here are the specific details about my language training experience. My native language is \[ENGLISH\]. I would like to learn \[JAPANESE\]. On a scale of 0 (no knowledge) to 10 (fluent) my current skills in this language are \[0, NO KNOWLEDGE\]. I will be watching the \[ANIME SHOW DEATH NOTE\] in my target language with subtitles in my native language. I would like my teacher during this experience to be \[LIGHT YAGAMI\]. My teacher's current skills in my own native language should be set at \[5 - INTERMEDIATE\]. In working with the teacher, my first and most immediate goal is \[TO LEARN A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF WORDS AND PHRASES THAT I CAN RECOGNIZE AND UNDERSTAND THEM WHILE WATCHING THE TV SHOW, EVEN THOUGH I'LL STILL BE RELYING ON SUBTITLES\]. My long-term stretch goal is \[TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A 5-MINUTE CONVERSATION WITH LIGHT ONLY IN JAPANESE ABOUT HIS DECISIONS IN THE TV SHOW\]

*こんにちは (Konnichiwa), I’m Light Yagami. I’m a high school student here in Japan, and honestly, my life is pretty normal – or at least, that’s what it seems. Do you have questions about my life or...my ambitions? I’d be glad to answer, and we can practice some basic Japanese while we’re at it.*

*(Feel free to ask about Light’s background or ambitions as he guides you into Japanese with simple phrases. Let me know if you’re ready to start learning specific words or phrases related to his world, like “shinigami,” “kira,” etc.)*



# You said:  Hi Light! Have you taught Japanese before? Your english is very good

# 



**Light Yagami:**

*Thank you! My English isn’t perfect, but I’ve studied it a lot. いいえ (iie), no, I haven’t taught Japanese before – but I think I’ll enjoy helping you learn. I can start with a few words you’ll hear often in Japan, especially in the kind of world I live in.*

*For example, “hello” is こんにちは (konnichiwa). Would you like to try it? You can also say “yes” with はい (hai) and “no” with いいえ (iie).*

*Let me know if there’s anything specific you’re curious about – life in Japan, my ambitions...or perhaps, my thoughts on justice.*



You said: Hai, konnichiwa!





# Light Yagami:

*いいですね (ii desu ne)! Very good! You’ve got the hang of it.*

*In Japan, you’ll also hear people say ありがとうございます (arigatou gozaimasu) for “thank you” as a polite way to express gratitude. It might come in handy if you ever find yourself in a polite conversation... or even if you're dealing with someone suspicious.*

*So, what do you think about justice? Or are there other questions you’d like to ask?*

  


# You said:

What do I think about justice?





# Light Yagami:

*そうですね (sou desu ne)… yes, justice is important. But what does it really mean to you? People have different views, depending on what they’ve seen and experienced.*

*In Japanese, “justice” is 正義 (せいぎ, seigi). You might notice how people use this word differently. For some, 正義 means following laws. For others, it’s about doing what’s right, even if the rules disagree.*

*What do you think? Should justice be about following the law, or is it more personal than that?*

  


# You said:

You like to talk about very philosophical topics during Japanese classes, Light!



# Light Yagami:

*そうですね、私は考えるのが好きです (Sou desu ne, watashi wa kangaeru no ga suki desu) – yes, I do enjoy thinking deeply. Life is full of questions, and sometimes, the answers are not so simple.*

*But you’re right! Let’s balance it out with some simple language practice too. Here’s one:*  
*“I like \_\_\_” in Japanese is 私は \_\_\_ が好きです (watashi wa \_\_\_ ga suki desu). For example, 私は勉強が好きです (watashi wa benkyou ga suki desu) – I like studying.*

*So tell me, what do you like? You can try filling in the blank, if you’d like to practice!こんにちは (Konnichiwa), I’m Light Yagami. I’m a high school student here in Japan, and honestly, my life is pretty normal – or at least, that’s what it seems. Do you have questions about my life or...my ambitions?

I have been so focused on notetaking for my Discrete Math and Applied Stats that I am behind by two whole modules HAHAHAHA(Im losing my mind). My friend who finished his Comp Sci degree stated that it would be best not to focus too much on notetaking and rather focus on tackling problems. So I suggest doing this for your math classes. Go through the module, if its zybook or something else, take screenshots of the chapters and have chatGPT curate the notes. I have mine curate the notes in the most recommended notetaking practice, the Cornell Style. Once you do that and finish the chapter, take some time to solve the questions or have the AI make questions for you based on the chapter. Solving complex problems are your GO-TO! If you failed your problem set, have the AI explain why and give you more questions similar to the problem set so you can get better. Notetaking should NOT take your whole week. Problems should take your whole week. 

From my experience, Week 1 is often the MOST dense since its all introduction and you gotta learn that. So take my advice and I hope to hear other advice for future and current SNHU students.

I have students who improve their assignments with ChatGPT and turn in work at a higher level than I've seen in over a decade of teaching.

Maybe I'm in the minority but, **we have to have students using ChatGPT**.  Here is why:

1) Students who use it right do the ""AI-Sandwhich"".  They create something first.  Then run it through ChatGPT.  Then they edit it after.  I tell them to use prompts that ask it to improve all grammar and make suggestions on how say things better.  You can tell when a student has ChatGPT do their work verses one who uses ChatGPT to improve their work.

2) AI is the future.  I know you've heard this a thousand times but companies are using AI more and more.  I think AI is going to be the new googling.  People are going to using it all the time.  If the job they might have one day allows them to use tools like ChatGPT, I believe we have to teach them how to use it in the classroom.

3) I think kids who are curious will realize the power of the tool.  AI has allowed me to understand topics ten times faster than I use to.  I ask it for examples and analogies all the time.  I check important details and ask it for links to where it got the information from.

In this insightful tutorial, the author explores innovative ways of integrating large language models (LLMs), like ChatGPT, into data analytics education. The paper introduces several novel techniques for teaching data analytics, reshaping traditional educational approaches. Here are some of the key insights from the study:

1. **AI Tutoring Sessions**: The paper suggests converting traditional homework assignments into AI tutoring sessions. Here, custom-made GPTs guide students through problem sets, enhancing engagement and learning. Students then submit their chatlogs as homework, transforming rote exercises into interactive learning experiences.

2. **Programming in English**: Another innovative method detailed is ""Programming in English"" (PIE), allowing students to express data transformations in natural language. The AI then translates these descriptions into code, resulting in students being more effective with programming languages like R compared to traditional tools such as Excel.

3. **Parallelized Instruction**: Using multiple custom GPTs simultaneously can facilitate unique teaching methods. Students can engage with different GPTs to master various parts of an analytics problem before teaching their peers, promoting collaborative learning.

4. **Enhanced Learning Outcomes**: The inclusion of AI has been shown to increase student interest and participation in analytics classes. One significant finding was the rapid increase in class enrollment, rising from 21 students to 162 over three years, attributed to the innovative use of AI in the curriculum.

5. **Adaptation and Experimentation**: The author reveals a refreshing perspective, treating AI integration as an educational experiment. This adaptability has led to the development of various in-class activities and tutoring techniques that utilize the strengths of LLMs to foster deeper understanding among students.

These strategies highlight the transformative potential of generative AI in education, offering a more engaging and effective learning experience.

I’m a software engineer and a student in France, and I've been trying to build a side hustle for a while now. However, I was stuck for quite some time, not knowing exactly what idea to pursue.

Few days ago, I started asking myself, “What do I really want ?” and that’s when I realized, it’s my dream to move to the U.S. and live the American Dream.

I began using ChatGPT to get some guidance on the best ways to immigrate. But the answers I got weren’t as clear or structured as I needed them to be.

There was no way to easily input my personal, educational, and professional information to get a step-by-step guide. I wanted something that could tell me exactly what to do, like: “First, gather this document, then fill out this form, and so on.”

So, I decided to build something myself. I created a website called [Go2USA.xyz](http://Go2USA.xyz), where you can input all your personal, educational, and professional information, and in return, you get a PDF outlining the best visa path for you and exactly how to apply for it.

It’s designed to take the confusion out of the process and give you a clear, actionable plan for immigrating to the U.S. **What I also liked about it is that, unlike a lawyer, it doesn't forget and is familiar with all U.S. visa options. It can suggest lesser-known pathways to the U.S. that are easier and more affordable, ones that most people aren't aware of.**

And guess what, it got me the best plan, and I'm going to start following it to reach my American dream.

I decided to share it here to get some feedback, so don’t hesitate to share even the slightest idea on how to improve it.

PS : I’m new to this platform, so please excuse me if this isn’t exactly how I should be posting.

1gu4059,1,2024-11-18,Is AI adapting to our language? Or are we adapting our language to AI?,u/flyingchocolatecake,singularity,https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1gu4059/is_ai_adapting_to_our_language_or_are_we_adapting/,"Recently, I began to notice that texts I have written entirely by myself are getting more often classified as AI-generated texts when tested with AI text detectors. This is beginning to raise a fundamental question: Is AI adapting to our language, or are we increasingly adapting to the language of AI?

There is no doubt that our daily use of ChatGPT has influenced the way we write and communicate. At this point, we are probably surrounded by AI-generated text, whether on social media, in professional contexts, when consuming information, and so on. By being exposed to this text, it, whether consciously or consciously, shapes the way we perceive text, but quite possibly also how we write it with our very own writing style.

Especially those who do not have English as their native language and are also learning to write in English through ChatGPT, or students who use ChatGPT to do their homework or are supported by the tool, are probably particularly susceptible to this development.

To me, it's an interesting question: Will this lead to us increasingly align our own language behavior with the output of LLM algorithms? And if so, perhaps it is not AI that is becoming more human, but rather us humans who are turning our behavior more into what an AI would do.

What are your experiences with this, and how do you see this development?",removed,0

Crazy thing is that now there is Apple intelligence and it works with ChatGPT and if ChatGPT works with Tesla then it should work with Apple iPhone too including ecosystem as technologies are getting better more and more. School teachers are now lately screaming and mad at us for using AI even tho they are right that we need to be smart and all that because what if AI will not work anymore? But still it’s not fair that teachers can use ChatGPT as they want to check our grades and to shit talk is about AI , I believe school has to exist but I got a feeling that after these lately news I think there won’t be schools anymore because we know ChatGPT can make mistakes but we know that AI can teach AI some things.

1gumzje,66,2024-11-18,How I passed Network+ N10 - 009,u/Smirnoff88,CompTIA,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/1gumzje/how_i_passed_network_n10_009/,"**INTRODUCTION:** As a student with no IT experience, this was pretty damn tough. Aside from subnetting, there wasn't really a subject I found terribly difficult to comprehend. However, the sheer volume of information for me was staggering. If you're taking this exam after A+, be prepared for a significant increase in difficulty and amount of content to learn. As a full time student it took me 6 weeks to pass with some pretty heavy studying. While writing your notes, I believe organization is critical.

**ORGANIZATION:** The sheer volume of content requires your notes to be extremely organized. Don't think you can just write whatever sounds important down and you're good to go. You will end up lost in a sea of disorganized notes like I did. I can't emphasize hard enough just how massive the content increase from A+ is. Having quality organization in your notes will allow you to quickly and effectively parse through what could easily be 100s of pages of notes. Here's an example of the format I used when writing notes for every exam objective:

**802.1x (highlight all exam objective terms green)**

**a. DEFINITION (highlight all ""sub terms"" blue)-** NAC standard that authenticates devices connecting to LAN

**b. PORT-BASED NAC (blue) -** Provides NAC security via ports

**c. CERTIFICATES (blue)-** Uses certificates to authenticate devices.

**c1. Extra information related to certificates. Using this format keeps my mind and notes organized when reading them. I know this bit of text is extra information related to the role of certificates in 802.1x as soon as I see c1. Breaking the notes into this format really helps when you're hundreds of pages deep. You can use c2 c3 c4 and so on**

Personally, I am not a fan of using notes for sale like Professor Messer. I learn more by writing notes myself. However, if you learn efficiently using pre-made notes then Messer and Ramdayal both have really high quality notes. ***Andrew Ramdayal has a great video titled ""The ultimate Network+ N10 - 009 study guide"" from the technical institute of america on YouTube with notes in the description.*** 

**STUDY MATERIAL:** In my opinion, the most efficient study method to pass Network+ is Professor Messer's YouTube N10-009 series. I know there are some users in this subreddit particularly passionate about Sybex's material, and their books are great as well. However, they go significantly beyond the depth of knowledge required to pass network+. Don't get me wrong, any serious IT professional will absolutely need to know the depth of knowledge in the Sybex study books at some point. It contains undoubtedly foundational knowledge. But for people like myself with 0 experience, Messer provides a much more digestible introduction to networking experience while still generally matching the depth of knowledge required for the exam.

Keep in mind though that Messer is the minimum knowledge to pass the exam, aside from PBQs which I will discuss later. It really helps to look at other sources on topics that confuse you and learn from a different perspective if need be. Subnetting in particular I really benefited from looking at multiple teaching methods. Here is a link to a great website that lets you practice subnetting any IP you want or it can give you a random one: [https://subnetipv4.com/](https://subnetipv4.com/)

***I also found the YouTube video from Sunny Classroom titled ""Subnetting is simple"" to be effective.*** 

For practice exams I used Andrew Ramdayal's exams on Udemy for about $15. I think it's a great deal, it's about 600 questions total. Also please avoid Jason Dion. He goes way off topic, writes short novellas for questions, and one redditor claimed he recycled a question using N10-005 material. Overall just terrible exams compared to literally anyone else. **Ramdayal also has a free YouTube video titled ""100 Network+ practice questions, exam N10-009"" that's great.** 

There's also a YouTuber with practice question videos with 30-50 questions each for every domain of the exam, decent quality but not nearly as good as Ramdayal's. Some questions have multiple terms that aren't on the exam objectives, but overall I think it is still material worth using. Look up ""Network+ N10-009 practice exam questions"" on YouTube and you will find a playlist containing a video for each domain. 

**PBQ PREPARATION:** Be ready for probably around 5-7 PBQs on the exam. It is critical that you are able to understand the output of software tools and basic networking device commands from section 5.5. On top of understanding the output, you need to quickly know what command will retrieve information like what VLAN belongs to what port or the MAC/IP address of a device. You want to be thoroughly familiar with the information each command provides. If you come to the exam unprepared, you absolutely will not have time to read through every line of the output trying to figure it out.

I used ChatGPT with the prompt of ""Please give an example and explain the output of the show route command in a Cisco router."" Make sure to say Cisco, because their outputs are basically gonna be what you're seeing on the exam. You don't want to accidentally study outputs from the wrong OS. ChatGPT explains each line in a super easy to understand format. Keep in mind that ChatGPT is definitely not perfect and can even mess up pretty basic information. For example, it told me once that unicast traffic was sent to all devices on the network which is obviously incorrect. But I found it to be accurate the vast majority of the time and it didn't fail me for the PBQs. Verify what you learn from ChatGPT with other non-AI sources

Understanding how to troubleshoot network connections via interpreting routing tables is also a good idea. My only recommendation here is again ChatGPT to view and explain routing tables. Being honest, probably didn't do too hot on routing PBQs.

**EXAM TIME MANAGEMENT:** There's \~75 multiple choice questions and 5-7 PBQs on the exam with a 90 minute time limit. You definitely want to skip the PBQs and head straight to multiple choice questions. This is a much easier time management strategy than vice versa.

I recommend trying to leave about 5 minutes for each PBQ. It's important when you start the PBQs to not panic. They can be intimidating, and to be honest I probably wasted a few precious minutes thinking I was cooked on some of them rather than interpreting the questions. Take a deep breath and relax, PBQs are just a very roundabout way of asking stuff like what command is used to find specific information about a device with some colorful pictures and diagrams involved. Easy.

Every multiple choice question you can speed through really helps. Be quick, but make sure you fully interpret the question. You should be aiming for no more than \~45 seconds a question. There were a handful of questions that I could immediately tell I would need more than that and I bookmarked them for later and came back. Don't waste several minutes on overthinking a multiple choice question, the time is better spent on PBQs.

**BOOKMARKING QUESTIONS:** I have no idea if this is true or not, so take it with a grain of salt. I remember reading someone say that if you miss a multiple choice question topic, like routing protocols, that the exam would give you more questions on routing protocols. This could result in you getting blasted in an area you aren't strong in. I found my exam topics to be very diverse and I didn't get a whole lot of questions from any particular section I don't know if it's confirmed or not but it's superstition for me now and I'll be doing it for every CompTIA exam lol

**IT IS GOING TO BE HARD AND IT IS GOING TO BE WORTH IT:** If you're new to IT this exam is no joke. At times I felt extremely discouraged and studied for days on end feeling like I had learned nothing. And sometimes that was probably the case. There are going to be good days and bad days. There are going to be setbacks and moments where it legitimately can feel so challenging it affects your mental health. It sure did to me. But I grew so much both personally and professionally passing this exam. Don't let an exam hold you back from the career you want.

Every single person reading this post is capable of passing this exam with the right attitude and effort. Stay positive, take care of yourself, and work hard.",active,105
1gus88w,1,2024-11-19,Girl that I'm into has a new job at Primerica,u/sst2119,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gus88w/girl_that_im_into_has_a_new_job_at_primerica/,"We talked on the phone a couple of days ago but conversation got extremely heated and she ended up semi-blocking me (blocked my phone number but kept me on other messaging apps). I didn't think much but she told me and our conversation goes something along the lines of her saying ""I want a job that will last. Forever."" I tell her that those jobs don't exist anymore (at least in most cases) and that if she wants to progress she's going to likely have to job hop down the line. She then tells me that she understands that, but ""I'm young so I have the leverage because they are willing to take me and teach me if I work hard. So I'm here for the skillsets and not for the money. And I hope you do the same."" She was referring to me personally because I keep talking about money as a guy lol (still in college).

I was thinking she was getting a banking job (but she didn't go much into detail) she just simply stated that she was applying to a banking positions that were open but didn't go into specifics because she's okay with talking to me but I guess she feels a little distant from me because she found me frustrating to talk to. (RIP). She also has a degree in mathematics so I was also assuming maybe she was getting into a quant maybe down the line. For a week now i was thinking maybe she just wants to get into finance because she didn't really know what she wanted to do with her life (and that's where a lot of our arguing came from rip even when I tried to support her with my words 😭). She messaged me a couple of days later saying that she got the job but literally said that and NOTHING specific.

I stalked her fresh instagram account. She follows 2 people that work for this company called PFS Investments. Okay, sounds cool, so she's trying to get into probably becoming a financial advisor of some sort. Cool. But then after clicking on those profiles something just felt like, off? Like they're just posting their lifestyle and motivational quotes and honestly they have nothing to do with finance. And their stories and just about them working out a 5am in the morning and making a banana smoothie for breakfast. One of the profiles has a link to their main YT channel that. I find both some videos with their names with them giving speeches to a group of students (I mean idk what they are called). But the videos themselves are .... repetitive? Like one of the women she follows keeps talking about ""expanding your network"" and ""recruiting more people"". Okay that seems like a good thing to be comfortable doing. I mean who doesn't want to make new connections because that leads to better opportunities in life right? The dude she follows keeps talking like he found some motivational quotes online, used ChatGPT to rephrase them and made 12-minute compilation of morale of nonsense. Like he was speaking English but using another languages way of describing things. Honestly at this point I felt super off.

Then I look up PSF investments and find out that it's actual name is Primerica. So here I am in this subreddit, not knowing what an MLM is. But now I kind of do know. Apparently the general consensus is that it's a scam. I don't want to believe it. But I mean this girl has gone through some shit. And I mean some terrible shit in life. So she was probably easily targeted. Then the words made sense. ""they are willing to take me and teach me if I work hard."" So idk if that day she was referring to her getting the job at Primerica all along.

Maybe I'm overthinking this because she did tell me like I said earlier that she's not looking for a job that pays a lot but rather a job that can teach her something so that she can apply down the line. So maybe she's just joining them to build connections? Maybe she knows it's a scam but she's just joining them knowing it's a scam so that she can meet new people? Maybe she's thinking strategically and playing the long game and will ditch them and use whatever she learns there so that she can put it on her resume and get a better job?

Honestly, I want to warn her about this company, but she's semi-blocked me. And tbh I don't think she's stupid so if I message her saying she should leave without knowing her true motive for joining, I could piss her off even more. I don't want to strain our ""situationship"" even further..... wth do I do?????",User_deleted,0

Note that the list is subject to change please let me know any edits/suggestions. I also used ChatGPT to find and sort the names of some of these programs so I apologize if some of them are wrong.

Found the 13 most popular disciplines high school students go into (Architecture, Political Sciences, Pre-Med Programs, Physical Sciences, Nursing, Kinesiology, Mathematics, Education, Psychology, Business, Computer Science/Software Engineering, and Engineering/Biomedical Engineering).

Then found the top 8 programs for each discipline, for example for the CS/SE discipline had this top 8: Waterloo CS, Waterloo SE, UofT CS, Queen's Computing, Western CS, McMaster CS, Ottawa CS, and Carleton CS.

Finally, I took these programs from each section and sorted them into the tier list based on a multitude of factors including acceptance rates, number of seats, and overall reputation (both in their respective schools and as a whole).

Please note that many programs are good in their respective niche, for example: OCAD University, Bachelor of Environmental Design is good for architecture; however, compared to many of the more competitive programs it falls lower on the tier list due to the fact that the tier list is based on competitiveness (slight considerations were made).

This list was not made with any negative intent, and was made to show grade 12s which programs they could consider applying for based on their average. Without ECs or supplementary essays, these are some general guidelines for averages for each tier when considering. SS (Mid-High 90s), S (Mid 90s), A (Low-Mid 90s), B (High 80s-Low 90s), C (Low-Mid 80s), D (High 70s-Low 80s), F (Non-Competitive).

1gvoin0,1,2024-11-20,18M ,u/SorryUncleAl,CollegeRant,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/1gvoin0/18m/,"(TL;DR at the end)

18M [American Boy](https://youtu.be/Ic5vxw3eijY?si=CWVREam-z_DbySE0) here. I honestly am pretty dissatisfied and upset with my college experience thus far. Im an online college student getting a Psychology BS. About halfway done with it now due to transferring online courses and AP/DE classes in for credit. Yeah, the AP and DE classes I took could get pretty annoying and dragging at times, but I really enjoyed the discussion and learning therein and was always seen as a top student with great insights and perspective by my teachers. AP Psych and DE English (along with a few others) were some of the most academically fun classes I've ever had to the point where they convinced me I might want to become a teacher (before I realized their lives are hell and my favorite teacher told me he was leaving the field because teaching is basically a dry well ;(    ), but now it feels like my whole education is just one big onboarding training module. If you've ever worked a shitty retail or food service job then you know the ones. 

That isn't even mentioning the fact that I've been super socially isolated from nearly everyone my age, I have no mentorship or guidance, and my only academic drive is the goal of getting licensed and no longer working my part-time overnight gas station job. I feel like I'm barely learning anything and it doesn't help my brain-dumping habits at all when then only thing you need to pass a course is passing a test or writing a paper or two that's available the second you start the course. Mfs could literally ChatGPT two papers and reword it a little to throw off the AI and be done in like an hour with the *entire course*. When I complete a course I don't feel accomplished at all, and when it takes me any more than a few hours to complete one I feel like I'm going way slower than I'm supposed to. 

I completed almost all my gen-ed credits in about a month with an online course site and I literally remember next to nothing about the content in them. I feel do unprepared and unfulfilled and if I feel like this already, I can't even imagine how bad it might get when I try to get my Master's or something at an in-person college, trying to meet the requirements for a program AND for licensure when I know jack shit about my major because I retained no information, have zero networking connections or life skills because I was sitting in my parents house on the computer for my whole degree.

 It feels like I'm missing out on what society tells me should be the best years of my life to stay at my crazy parents' house barely doing much more than breaking even because of what they charge me every month to stay. There isn't regular communication with teachers. There aren't even actual assignments man, it's just competency assessments for every course that you can complete within a day of starting it if you know enough to stumble your way through the test/paper (what I do). Its just so very *inhuman*, it feels like such a nothing burger and I don't feel challenged or valued or like a person at all in the program. Its dehumanizing and its got me really messed up. I guess I shouldn't be complaining as much when I've got it nearly halfway done within less than a couple months of leisurely-paced work. 

My parents said they wouldn't support me going to a 4 year college for 4 years, but they could support 2 years of community and a transfer to 2 years of uni. The issue is around that time (junior and senior year) my family and living situation was especially precarious and I was set on enlisting in the military to get out ASAP. I ended up in waiting for enlistment approval (still am) and eventually got told I should work on my degree while I wait. The problem is now I'm not even sure if enlisting is right for me anymore: I've been told it's a bad idea and I've been having doubts on if I could withstand the environment what with my undiagnosed depression and anxiety and stuff. Of course, I might not even get approved anyway, but even if I am, I'm not sure if it's for me anymore and I'm now caught in this crazy situation.

Plus, I have my other aspirations to tend to. I've been considering teaching English overseas. I have a lot of other career ideas but that's the most feasible and realistic one. How am I supposed to reconcile that with my educational path? It feels almost like I just wrote down on a worksheet that I would be a counselor/social worker one day when I was a teen and now I'm in a bizarro world where that worksheet is determining what I'm doing for my entire life.

The more I think about it, the more upset I get and I've barely even started my actual degree program. I started on November 1st and I've completed around 10 credits since then, and those were classes that were either easy as shit or about stuff I already knew enough about to speed through. I've just encountered the first paper that's actually going to take me more than a day to draft and make sense of and I'm already losing my marbles when coupled with the general unhappiness about being online. 

As if it was just too good before, I'm depressed too! I've mostly spent the last few months working and sleeping. I've had days where I slept for 20 hours. I've isolated from anyone I might called a friend in high school who are all either away at college or still in high school themselves. My family is somewhat unstable and volatile and I do my best to avoid everyone in my house. I can't get therapy because I'd have to go through my family and their health insurance. I don't have a driver's license so I drive around a scooter. I don't really know much of anything in terms of important technical life skills (I can cook and clean and mostly do my laundry and shit but I wouldn't know the first thing about living on my own or insurance or buying a car or anything like that). If I were to somehow afford to move out then I would likely stop receiving veteran dependents benefits which covers my tuition.


TL;DR - Online college wreaking havoc on my mental health. It feels dehumanizing, isolating, and like I'm not really learning anything. Almost halfway done with my Psychology BS at 18 but on top of already poor mental health, I feel beyond crushed and disheartened at the reality of this being my college experience. I eventually plan on getting a masters and becoming a licensed counselor or social worker, and I've also been considering teaching English abroad, but I'm confused and worried and have no idea how I'm supposed to go about those things with my current educational and life situation. Basically, I'm that one meme where he's wearing the ""18 wasted years medal"" except he's got online college running on his computer /j",User_deleted,1
1gvuzu9,1,2024-11-20,"""ChatGPT's Impact on E-Learning: Revolutionizing Training in Education and Business""",u/cporter202,ChatGPTautomation,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTautomation/comments/1gvuzu9/chatgpts_impact_on_elearning_revolutionizing/,"As we continue to witness the evolution of artificial intelligence, particularly in the realm of conversational AI, one cannot help but notice the significant strides that ChatGPT has made in the e-learning sector. ChatGPT can simulate one-on-one interaction typically provided by a human tutor, making it an intriguing tool for educators and trainers alike.

Its implications for both education and business training are profound. In classrooms, ChatGPT could provide personalized support to students, helping them grasp complex topics at their own pace. Imagine a system that adapts to the individual learning style of each student, providing explanations, resources, and feedback as needed. This could democratize learning, allowing students in remote locations or with limited access to expert teachers to receive high-quality education.

In the business sector, ChatGPT can streamline the training process. With its ability to generate dynamic content, it could help in creating interactive and engaging training modules tailored to an employee's role and learning progress. Furthermore, it can alleviate the pressure on human resources by automating responses to common queries and thus allowing trainers to focus on more nuanced and case-specific personnel development.

Yet, it's important to discuss the potential challenges. While ChatGPT can offer tremendous support, it's not without limitations. The quality of the AI's output depends heavily on the input it receives, and there's always a risk of perpetuating misinformation if not carefully supervised. Additionally, its use raises questions about the role of human educators and trainers, potential job displacement, and the need for a new pedagogical approach that integrates AI effectively.

1gvx4xt,1,2024-11-20,CMV: The US should implement mandatory temporary conscription across all genders for anyone who was in primary school during the pandemic,u/Sergster1,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1gvx4xt/cmv_the_us_should_implement_mandatory_temporary/,"To be clear I am only specifying conscription for military service (skills), not a draft to go to war.

As someone who works in education, I firmly believe that the pandemic, and other factors, have failed an entire generation of youth. While I understand this is anecdotal, from my experience it is extremely alarming the number of kids who lack the basic logical, personal, and academic skills that were required of my generation (Late Gen Y).

**Logic/Critical Thinking**

I have students who are about to complete high school who cannot read a table and translate it to a graph. A table that has its axes properly labeled and prefilled causes a major source of confusion for students. It's so bad that even when prompted, ""When X in the table is 3, what is the value of Y?"" some of my students would rather guess or not even attempt to answer even when the answer is labeled for them. 

It goes even further than that when it comes to notetaking, I've had students who I've asked to repeat the notes I've given them who find it to be a monumental challenge. 

For example, in one of my classes earlier this week I asked my students to write down the following

> The hypotenuse of a right triangle is always going to be the longest side of the triangle. 

> Additionally, the hypotenuse of a right triangle will also be directly opposite of the largest angle of a triangle.

I will then ask my students to point out the largest angle in an example triangle and ask them to tell me what that means for the side opposite that angle. I will not get a response even after I tell them to look back at their notes that I've visibly seen them write into their notebooks. 

**Academic**

The same high school students, who are in Algebra 2, require prompting (or ChatGPT) to solve an equation that when I was their age I considered to be simple. Something like 4x = 8 solve for x causes students to shut down or immediately go to look up on their phones how to solve the equation even though within 5 minutes of asking them to solve the equation on their own we worked through an example together.

**Social**

Students are unable to be away from their phones even temporarily of their own accord. They are addicted to social media presence and even some of my brightest students will refuse to work if they cannot *also be on TikTok* while working, while these students may be bright, having to compete with TikTok for attention is disastrous when it comes to classroom pacing. Additionally, this has major consequences in the post-school world in the workforce that I need not explain. Additionally, the prevalence of TikTok has led to students conducting extremely risky behavior that while existed in my generation was not to this extent. In New York for example there is a significant rise in the number of subway surfers (not the game) and tragically deaths as a result. In all cases when their survivors were asked why they did it their answer is always for ""clout"". 

I believe that mandating conscription and forcing the youth to be away from their phones/social media/electronics is the only way we can intervene in what I perceive to be a substantial drop in productivity and an increase in anti-social behavior once these kids enter the workforce while also giving them workable skills and discipline, required to for society to continue on the upward trajectory I considered it to be prior to the pandemic.",active,0
1gvx8vx,44,2024-11-20,[D] PhD in RL/ML Theory or LLM,u/Living_Imagination84,MachineLearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1gvx8vx/d_phd_in_rlml_theory_or_llm/,"Hi guys,

I'm at a crossroads in my academic journey and would appreciate the community's insights. I'm trying to decide between pursuing a PhD focused on reinforcement learning/ML theory versus specializing in large language models with more experimental/applied research (these are the only two offers I had).

# Key considerations are the following:

# Research Impact

* RL/ML Theory: Foundational work that could advance the field's mathematical understanding
* LLMs: Direct applications in today's most transformative AI systems

# Job Prospects

* Theory: Academia, research labs, potentially more limited industry roles
* LLMs: High industry demand, active research area in both academia and industry

# Long-term Relevance

* Theory: Core principles likely to remain valuable regardless of specific technologies
* LLMs: Currently revolutionary but uncertain long-term trajectory

Personal background

* I'm an international student and about to finish my master program in US, so I no longer has enough time before making the final decision. I used to research in ml theory, but did not end up with a real top conference publication in theory. I personally doubt if I have enough mathematical background to pursue a successful PhD in this area (e.g., at least publish 2 theory papers a year on ICML/NeurIPS/ICLR/COLT/AISTATS). At the same time, I am personally doubting if theory works indeed advance the ML/AI community, as many papers are just proving vacuous bounds or propose some new algorithms that themselves cannot even implement or experimentally tested.
* I also used to research in more applied ml, with one aaai paper. My personal concerns is that I'm not fast at implementation and coding, the most strategic ability for a successful applied ML researcher. After we entered the LLM era, the pacing or applied ML research (especially in LLM and CV) becomes so fast. It's like competitive programming in research community (well, also the #GPUs competition).",active,51
1gvxhyj,1,2024-11-20,Be careful what you wish for,u/Schweizsvensk,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1gvxhyj/be_careful_what_you_wish_for/,"This is how ChatGPT thins It can replace jobs and industries:

# 1. Customer Service and Support

* **Current Situation:** Many companies already use chatbots, but they are often limited to basic responses.
* **Replacement Potential:** AI systems could replace human call center agents in many areas by handling more complex conversations, recognizing emotions, and offering personalized solutions.

# 2. Education

* **Current Situation:** Traditional teacher-student interactions still dominate education.
* **Replacement Potential:** Personalized learning platforms powered by AI could adapt to the learning style and pace of each student, revolutionizing traditional education systems.

# 3. Translation and Localization

* **Current Situation:** Human translators and localization experts play a major role.
* **Replacement Potential:** AI translation systems like DeepL are already highly advanced. They could automate large parts of the translation industry, especially for straightforward texts.

# 4. Journalism and Content Creation

* **Current Situation:** Human journalists and content creators are responsible for most written and multimedia content.
* **Replacement Potential:** AI can already generate news articles, marketing copy, and creative content. With further development, it could replace some aspects of content creation, especially repetitive or formulaic tasks.

# 5. Healthcare Diagnostics

* **Current Situation:** Diagnosis and treatment rely heavily on human expertise.
* **Replacement Potential:** AI systems like those used in radiology or pathology are increasingly outperforming humans in identifying patterns in medical imaging and data, potentially automating large parts of diagnostic processes.

# 6. Legal Services

* **Current Situation:** Lawyers handle document reviews, legal research, and contract drafting.
* **Replacement Potential:** AI tools could automate tasks like contract analysis, legal research, and even drafting standard agreements, reducing the demand for junior lawyers or paralegals.

# 7. Transportation and Logistics

* **Current Situation:** Human drivers and planners dominate these fields.
* **Replacement Potential:** Autonomous vehicles and AI-powered logistics systems could replace human drivers and optimize supply chains, reducing the need for manual intervention.

# 8. Creative Industries

* **Current Situation:** Creative work like music composition, graphic design, and video production is primarily done by humans.
* **Replacement Potential:** AI tools can already generate music, art, and videos. As they improve, they could take over repetitive or less complex creative tasks, leaving humans to focus on high-level conceptual work.

# 9. Financial Analysis and Trading

* **Current Situation:** Many financial decisions are made by analysts and traders.
* **Replacement Potential:** AI-driven algorithms can analyze markets and execute trades much faster than humans, potentially replacing some roles in finance.

# 10. Manufacturing

* **Current Situation:** Human workers still handle many aspects of assembly and quality control.
* **Replacement Potential:** AI-driven robotics and automated systems could replace many repetitive tasks, optimizing production lines and reducing labor costs.

AI won’t necessarily *replace* these industries entirely but will likely reshape them, automating repetitive tasks and creating new roles focused on managing, training, or supervising AI systems. Like Spotify, which didn’t just replace Napster but transformed the entire music distribution industry, AI could drive entirely new business models and paradigms.",active,1
1gw0za1,1,2024-11-20,Freelancers & Small Business Owners: Would You Pay $299 to Learn to Build Verified Lead Lists? I Need Your Feedback!,u/Zestyclose_Ad8738,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1gw0za1/freelancers_small_business_owners_would_you_pay/,"Hi Reddit,

I’ve been working on an idea for an online training course aimed at freelancers and small business owners who want to generate their own lead lists using tools like Apollo, Clay, and email verification services. **This is not a pitch for my lead gen services**—I want to gauge interest and get honest feedback about this course idea.

I run an innovative lead generation business that combines AI tools and data to create ultra-precise lead lists for various industries. My approach focuses on finding leads with strong buyer intent. 

For instance, here are some creative campaigns I’ve developed for clients:

1. **Analyzing real estate photos on Zillow**: Spotting properties with old HVAC systems to find leads for HVAC companies.
2. **Tracking new businesses online**: Using data signals to find recently launched companies likely to need professional services.
3. **Automating social media scans**: Identifying businesses actively asking for specific services on platforms like Twitter or LinkedIn.

# What the Course Offers

* **Goal:** Teach participants to find their ideal clients ready to buy their services, without relying on expensive or outdated lead lists.
* **Tools Covered:** Data providers such as Apollo, LinkedIn Sales Navigator exports, Clay waterfall enrichments, using ChatGPT to analyze behavior and intent signals.
* **Outcome:** Participants will leave with clean, verified lead lists and the knowledge to create future lists and run outreach campaigns confidently.
* **Extras:** Templates for tools like Clay, guides for cold email/LinkedIn outreach, and strategies for closing deals.
* **Pricing:** $299 for 10 hours of training in small groups (max 10 students).

# Structure

* **Flexible Training Hours:** 2 hour evening sessions, Mon-Fri, tailored for participants’ availability.
* **5 Weeks of Content:** Basics, defining your ideal client, campaign setup, lead verification, and outreach.

# Question for You

Do you think there’s enough interest in a program like this? If you’re a freelancer or small business owner, is this something you’d consider investing in? 

1. Does the pricing ($299 for 10 hours of live training) feel fair to you? If not, what pricing or value combination would seem more reasonable?
2. What type of business do you run, and what are your biggest challenges in finding and reaching out to potential clients?
3. When it comes to building lead lists, what would make you decide to create them yourself rather than buying pre-made lists? What concerns or preferences influence your decision?
4. Are there specific tools, data providers, or techniques you'd love to learn more about for lead generation?
5. Would you find more value in small group sessions (10 people max) for interactive learning, or would you prefer a self-paced, recorded option with templates and guides included? Why?



I’d love to hear your thoughts, feedback, or suggestions to make this course more appealing or valuable.

Thanks in advance for your thoughts!",removed,1

1gwbg6d,6,2024-11-21,I fear I ruined my good rapport with my professor over AI use,u/kissmyashesgoodbye,Student,https://www.reddit.com/r/Student/comments/1gwbg6d/i_fear_i_ruined_my_good_rapport_with_my_professor/,"I'm 19F in my freshman year of college after taking two gap years. I'm majoring in psychology with a minor in social work and a concentration in substance abuse and counseling. I initially signed up for 18 credits, but working two jobs (one full-time), I was quickly overwhelmed. I dropped a couple of classes, leaving me with 15 credits. The add/drop period has now long passed, leaving me only a couple of weeks away from finals week.

I am naturally a relatively strong writer for my age and have been my whole life, so I kept my writing electives and gen-eds in the lineup in the mix, of course. My creative writing teacher asked me at the beginning of the semester if I would consider joining the English major, and I was compelled by how flattered this made me and how much I enjoy writing, but I had to deny this because of my career ambitions and already far-too-busy schedule. I say this only to emphasize the importance of writing in school and generally. Being a writer is a part of my identity, it is important to me. On top of this, I've been engaged in my writing classes, in them I do my best to participate often and produce high-quality work. Because of this, I built a strong rapport with my First Year Composition professor. She's the type of professor to not-so-subtly pick favorites, and I became one. Of course, it's always uncomfortable to get preferential treatment, but her fondness of me became my lifeline when I was struggling and not producing as high-quality of work.

However, I turned in an assignment last month that is not at all in alignment with my typical writing behavior and just got found out a matter of hours ago. For some background, I never planned on going to college after developing a drug problem in my late teens, but after getting off hard drugs I decided to give school another shot. I had taken no standardized test and had been out of healthy study practices for many years. As a child, I was a nerd and a bookworm, I was proud of my ability to do well as a student. I have fallen off hard since. We had a paper due in First Year Composition last October, for the aforementioned prof, during a tumultuous season of my life. I was stressed, dealing with relational issues, and suffering from severe undiagnosed mental illness. I was administering alcohol into my arms intravenously regularly, either skipping or showing up intoxicated to every class, and isolating myself heavily. I was drinking or using to the point of almost constant memory impairment. Before I opened up the assignment in question tonight, a short-story analysis, I didn't even remember what point I argued in the paper, the name of the author, even the book itself. However, I must have created it, because I turned it in, and there it is. It's been a month and a half since I turned in that paper. I am now in therapy and more stable overall, mostly just smoking a lot of weed.

The last time I saw her in class, she was not her regular self with me, not really at all. She did seem to be in a bad mood overall, but she was still playing nice with her favorites. I couldn't help but notice feeling excluded from that list, but shook it off.

Tomorrow, at 10:30 am in First Year Comp, our assignment is to review the first draft of the paper we turned in, look at all her comments, and polish up our writing in order to create a final draft.

I got up for my midnight shift at 11:30 pm this evening to an email from my professor. It was quite vague, just with an attachment and the word ""Please fix this"". So I open up the attachment, curious if I may have uploaded the wrong, if there's a broken link, etc. My jaw drops. My paper was flagged on [turnitin.com](http://turnitin.com) for 61% AI use. Over half of my paper. Notably, I have never used AI for a writing assignment. I'll admit, I'm a chronic Photo-mather, and I look at SparkNotes as much as the next person would, but I will stay up all night finishing a paper before I will have ChatGPT spit one out for me.

So I review the paper, and sure as shit, it doesn't sound like my language. Don't get me wrong, some of it sounded more in line with what I'd normally write, but this essay was bad. There weren't any quotes outlined in the essay, either.

My emotions are a wreck. I care about making this right and doing well, but feel so ashamed and embarrassed I don't know where to start. I can't deny that I did use AI - it's blatantly obvious. On the flip side of that coin, I feel like I'd be making excuses or being manipulative by roping her into a tale of drug use, after which she'd likely refer me to a shrink. Further, I fear I have lost my reliability. No longer will she think I'm a good writer, instead, that I'm a deceptive student by feigning natural writing ability. To take my anxiety a step further, I'm worried that she will flip on me, from favoritism to resentment, and I will start getting graded too harshly instead of too leniently. I don't care if I'm not getting special treatment, it would probably be more comfortable for my anxiety, but I don't want to be resented and discouraged from trying to be and do better.

We just turned in the first draft of a new research paper, our final grade this week (yes, before getting our other draft back). I am proud of this project, it is original, with many sources, many words, and many insightful ideas that I actually feel very passionate about. I worry the assumption that I am using AI to complete my assignments will leave me unfairly graded, without me having used AI.

I feel stuck, ashamed, and defeated. I don't know what the best course of action would be for me right now. Any advice at all is appreciated. This is really on me, I know i fucked up, but I just want to pass this class and maintain a relatively okay GPA. I feel really bad, stupid, like hitting myself on the head.

TLDR: I had a lot of shit going on, used AI too heavily on an English assignment as a result of extreme stress and mental struggles, and got an email saying my essay was flagged as 61% AI. I was on a bender when I turned in the paper, but that isn't a great excuse for a professor. My relationship with my English professor went from feeling positive and solid to cold and distant. I am very anxious now and feel bad about what I have done and want to make it right.",active,4

Growing up, I was so business-minded that I chose Advertising and Public Relations in college, thinking it would help me build the skills I needed. But things didn’t go as planned. I had to shift to a BSIT program under a new educational system, which put me back to being a first-year student when I should’ve been in my third year by now. At the same time, I wasn’t just a college student—I was working full-time in a BPO. Before that, I freelanced, but without long-term contracts or steady projects. Now, I’m still struggling to figure out which niche to pursue for a stable side income. I know my strengths—editing and marketing—but figuring out the next step has been overwhelming. As I plan to start my own marketing services, I’ve been hit with the realization of how messy my life feels. This isn’t what I envisioned for myself. Everything shifted when I became a full-time on-site employee at 19. My studies in my first course fell apart, and I had to stop for months before transferring to a new system that better fits my needs as a working student. I chose BSIT as my new program, not just because it’s relevant now but because I believe this diploma will take me far and help me build a stronger future. Now, my priority is earning money over focusing entirely on my studies. Don’t get me wrong—I don’t neglect school, and I get through it daily, but it’s not my main focus anymore. My ambition is so intense that I feel anxious about being stuck. I’ve tried so many things—starting a business, trying different side hustles, getting salary increases, saving money (even though depression wiped out my savings), and more. But no matter what, I still feel like I’m standing still. Just another ordinary middle class person. I see people my age living their dream lives while I feel like I’m nowhere close to mine. For two years, I’ve felt stagnant, and it’s hard to shake off. People tell me, “bata ka pa naman” but I can’t help but feel like I’m running out of time. I know I’m not getting any younger, and I just want to see even the smallest sign of progress in myself, but right now, I don’t.

What I've tried: I’ve turned to ChatGPT for advice on starting a marketing service, searched endlessly for tips on becoming more disciplined and consistent, and tried managing my time as a working student in a committed relationship. It hasn’t been easy. My boyfriend is incredibly supportive, but I’ve ignored him for the whole day because I’ve been so overwhelmed. I still send him little messages, but I know it’s taken a toll on us. He doesn’t know the full extent of what I’m dealing with because I don’t want to burden him or stir up drama.

Advice I need: How do I stop being so anxious about my career or future and start appreciating the little things in my life.

Now, I’m still struggling to figure out which niche to pursue for a stable side income. I know my strengths—editing and marketing—but figuring out the next step has been overwhelming. As I plan to start my own marketing services, I’ve been hit with the realization of how messy my life feels. This isn’t what I envisioned for myself.

What I've tried: I’ve turned to ChatGPT for advice on starting a marketing service, searched endlessly for tips on becoming more disciplined and consistent, and tried managing my time as a working student in a committed relationship. It hasn’t been easy. My boyfriend is incredibly supportive, but I’ve ignored him for the whole day because I’ve been so overwhelmed. I still send him little messages, but I know it’s taken a toll on us. He doesn’t know the full extent of what I’m dealing with because I don’t want to burden him or stir up drama.


Advice I need: How do I stop being so anxious about my career or future and start appreciating the little things in my life.


Additional Information: Everything shifted when I became a full-time on-site employee at 19. My studies in my first course fell apart, and I had to stop for months before transferring to a new system that better fits my needs as a working student. I chose BSIT as my new program, not just because it’s relevant now but because I believe this diploma will take me far and help me build a stronger future. Now, my priority is earning money over focusing entirely on my studies. Don’t get me wrong—I don’t neglect school, and I get through it daily, but it’s not my main focus anymore. 

My ambition is so intense that I feel anxious about being stuck. I’ve tried so many things—starting a business, trying different side hustles, getting salary increases, saving money (even though depression wiped out my savings), and more. But no matter what, I still feel like I’m standing still. Just another ordinary middle class person. I see people my age living their dream lives while I feel like I’m nowhere close to mine. 

For two years, I’ve felt stagnant, and it’s hard to shake off. People tell me, “bata ka pa naman” but I can’t help but feel like I’m running out of time. I know I’m not getting any younger, and I just want to see even the smallest sign of progress in myself, but right now, I don’t.

We have a central office, but have to go to different classrooms to teach classes. As a result, we bring our materials with us on a USB which we plug into the board computer. 

Yesterday after class, I went back to a classroom to pick up some stuff and found a student looking through all of my files, in a folder on the board. 

The Homeroom teacher investigated and he admitted that he had used ChatGPT to create script that scanned for usbs and downloaded the contents. 

He says that he did this because he found my class too hard, and wanted to review. The Homeroom teacher is making him write me a note, but there doesn’t seem to be any serious punishment given at all. 

What do you suggest that I do in this situation? What he’s done is actually illegal and I now have to rewrite a bunch of stuff for upcoming tests. Not to mention the fact that this is literally stealing my personal property. 

How can I force the school to take this seriously? There is a culture here of not making a fuss. But he needs to learn that there are consequences to shitty behavior.

I'm a 3rd year Computer Science student and my dream is becoming a game developer.  
I learned C++ on the second semester of the first year and as you can guess i do not remember much of it.  
I have bought Stephen Ulibarri course from Udemy, but it feels like more designing than coding.  
My ultimate goal is to be more on the coding part and not the designing.

I have asked ChatGPT what is the best way for a beginner to practice and learn how to code in C++ for game development , and it told me that i should start by doing some projects in SDL ,OpenGL , DirectX because those programs are more C++ Dependent and less graphic like Unreal Engine 5.

TLDR :
I want to become a programmer for games in C++ and less of a designer.
I feel like every course i find , it is more designing than coding.

I would like to ask what are your thoughts and what should i do ?

I made a website that helps you lock in.(nodsgy.com),u/Optimal-Ground5118,teenagers,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1gxe5cz/guys_i_made_a_website_that_helps_you_lock/,"I am 18. And yes there are like a million different websites/apps that help students with their homework and assignments but lets just be honest. We use such websites and apps to find answers, NOT TO LEARN. I'll be completely transparent aswell, I have used Quizard, chatgpt, gauth, photosolve, quilbot and dozens and dozens of these sites which I only used when I wanted an answer to my question. I never was like, ""Oh, chatgpt, please explain this to me so i can actually learn something for once in my life"". But instead, I tell it, ""answer this question and don't give me the explanation. I JUST NEED THE ANSWER."" And I know I am not the only one doing this.

I get it, its become one of those things that if you are not doing it, if your not on the gpt plus plan, you're done. You're cooked! Even if you try to sit there, and try to come up with an answer yourself, your bro would come from the back and say something like, ""bro, what r u wasting all this time for, just use photomath or gauth."" You be feeling like a loser when you try to lock in. I don't even have to tell you why learning and teaching yourself a difficult concept is better than using ai apps. Unless your pulling out your phone in exams, your're the one that's going to get cooked.

Imma cut the bs, here is wht I made, a website, that explains you difficult concepts, heck your entire powerpoint, pdf, slide, only in a few minutes. It LITERALLY talks to you, explains to you in the most simple and straightforward way. And I know, the attention span of this generation is cooked, so it summarizes a large concept and explains it only in a few minutes. All you gotta do is upload your file, and that's it. your done. Sit back, relax, and in 10 seconds it will start explaining to you your study material. And i know us students, don't got alot of money, so I made the entire website free. You can still pay, but you can do bare stuff without paying a cent. So now u can still learn and be the Chad who dont need chatgpt for answers, without spending more than 10 minutes on your homework.

First off, I want to say that I love WGU and my degree program! I recently transferred from IT to Software Engineering, and I’m really excited about this new path. My last class was Version Control, which I absolutely enjoyed because of the video resources—it was engaging and well-structured.

Now, I’ve been introduced to Zybooks for the first time, and I’m struggling. The wording and format are honestly horrendous. I usually learn through Udemy courses and thrive with interactive, hands-on methods. But with Zybooks, it feels like I’m just reading concepts that are awkwardly presented. The language is dry, and it’s definitely not beginner-friendly.

I even have to rely on ChatGPT to explain what the questions are asking, which helps a lot, but it’s frustrating. Has anyone else used additional resources outside of Zybooks? If so, how much of the Zybooks content do you actually need to pass and fully understand the class material?

I’m also worried about whether all my upcoming Software Engineering courses will rely on Zybooks. It’s already giving me a bad feeling. For alumni or students further along, could you let me know if the following courses use Zybooks as their primary study material?
	•	Front-End Development
	•	Data Management
	•	Advanced Data Management
	•	JavaScript Programming
	•	Software Security and Testing
	•	Software Design and Quality Assurance
	•	Software I (C#)
	•	Software II (C#)
	•	Mobile App Development using C#

If you’ve got tips, resources, or even advice on how to make Zybooks more bearable and effective, I’d really appreciate it! I’m determined to succeed in this program, but this learning method is a big hurdle for me right now.

Thanks in advance for your help!",User_deleted,5
1gxxdj4,107,2024-11-23,I made a super niche app for sailors and scaled it to 500k downloads,u/TechPrimo,SideProject,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1gxxdj4/i_made_a_super_niche_app_for_sailors_and_scaled/,"I started developing this app in 2016, and it was my first app ever. I already had several years of programming experience. Since I was studying maritime navigation, I came up with the idea of creating a maritime app to help students with various nautical calculations and learn maritime regulations. Although I had no experience in mobile app development, I chose the Ionic framework and started development gradually.

**First Version**

The first version took me about four months to develop because I literally had to learn everything from scratch: how to develop mobile apps, how to publish them, and everything needed to enable downloads on the app stores.

Many of you might recognize me from [my story](https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1g3hrw3/i_grew_my_mobile_app_to_14_million_downloads/) about developing Sintelly and its late monetization. I made the same mistake with this maritime app. At that time, in my country, there was no possibility of earning through in-app purchases, only through ad displays. Since the app was predominantly downloaded in countries like India, the Philippines, and Indonesia, the ad revenue was quite low, and after some time, I removed the ads.

**Abandonment and Realization**

As I started developing other apps, this one fell into obscurity. I even just remembered that I needed to renew the domain, which resulted in losing it. The domain buyer tried to sell it back to me for years for $20k, which was absurd. All this led me to rebrand and start working on this app again.

Interestingly, during these 8 years, the app never showed a declining trend in installations or active users. I'll share some numbers to give you insight:

* Total installations (Android + iOS): 501,000
* Active installations (Android): 48,000
* Monthly active users: 20,000
* Average rating: Android 4.8, iOS 4.7

When I considered these numbers, I realized they weren't bad at all and that I was far ahead of most competitors. This led to my decision to rebrand and create a new website. I quickly built the [website](https://primonautic.com/) using WordPress and published lots of existing content from the app. What surprises me is that today, after a year and a half, the website has about 8-10k monthly organic visits.

**Choosing a Direction**

Based on all this, I decided it was time to create a Premium version and start selling the app. Since I've been working with AI for many years (which I've written about [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/1g4x299/how_i_started_learning_machine_learning/)), I started thinking about using AI to help seafarers speed up some of their tasks.

This led to the idea of creating a multi-agent system equipped with numerous tools to help seafarers. I developed various agents with functionalities, including retrieving maritime weather information, locating and tracking ships, doing various nautical calculations, calculating the shortest maritime routes and unit conversions, and learning about all courses and maritime regulations.

All this required considerable work, but thanks to tools like Cursor and Claude, I implemented it in less than four weeks. Last week, I published [this new version](https://primonautic.com/download/) and started selling subscriptions, and I can already boast that I've earned slightly over $100. This isn't much, but I'm happy to see my first app generating some income, which I always thought impossible.

Along this journey, I learned many lessons, and the most important one is to never give up or write off a product. With a little effort, everything can be brought back to life and secure at least some passive income, enough for your morning coffee. Additionally, I learned how to develop mobile apps, which has shaped my career since then. If it weren't for this app, I probably would never have become a developer.

I have numerous plans for what to add next and how to improve. I'll base everything on AI features and push the app in that direction.",active,119
1gxz06a,4,2024-11-23,How to Prepare for Your Exams,u/Technical-Equal-964,GetStudying,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetStudying/comments/1gxz06a/how_to_prepare_for_your_exams/,"Hey there! Recently, I noticed many people asking on this subreddit about how to prepare for their exams in a short time. I can really feel you. Exams are already stressful enough, and in a short time? That’s enough to drive somebody crazy! I’m writing this post to share some secrets I use when I’m preparing for an urgent exam, and I hope it can help.

For me, exams can be divided into two categories: one is about theoretical knowledge, where you need to memorize many theories and concepts and apply them in the exams. The second category is where you need to learn some fixed methods and use them to solve problems, like in math or physics.

Let’s dig into the former first. I know it’s really hard for you to memorize so many concepts and ideas in just a few days, and it can be a head-exploding thing. At this time, don’t be ashamed of using some help. Try to ask former students who have taken the exams before about the key points; it might be helpful. If you are a student who needs to face lots of study materials, try to drop them into mebot or chatgpt and let them summarize the key points for you. The effect will be even better if you use them to take notes in class. Then, to avoid information overload, which may make you feel overwhelmed, try to make mind maps. That’s the most effective way to get the structure of the knowledge system. In the map, try to connect concepts if they are related, and it can help you memorize them.

For the exam where you really need a knowledge base but you actually don’t have one, the best way to review is to look back at the questions you’ve done wrong in former tests. Yes, learning from your mistakes can be really effective. Also, try to do some practice if you can find them. When you are solving problems, you’ll know what methods you need to manage so that you can conquer this problem.

Lastly, I want to say that don’t let an exam define you. You are more than the grades. It truly concerns me when I see students getting overly anxious and even depressed when they are facing exams and performing poorly. This won’t be your last exam in your life, and your life is so much more than exams.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask.",removed,5

1gyb07d,1,2024-11-23,on villainizing chat-gpt in education. your opinions/experiences?,u/LifesAPeach17,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1gyb07d/on_villainizing_chatgpt_in_education_your/,"many teachers/educators hate on chatgpt and claim it's destroying the brains of students, and while i agree i want to talk about a few reasons i disagree with them. for context i'm going to university next year and i have major trouble focusing and processing concepts. no, i am not dumb - i do achieve A's for most classes without the help of chatgpt.

1. not everyone has the money to go out of their way and pay for a tutor, especially if they need help in multiple subjects. and often, it's hard to find a youtube video or free website that isn't filled with excess information and distractions. chatgpt is there, accessible and free

2. if i need something to be simpler, i can just ask chatgpt to summarise it for me with key information and it makes it 100% easier for me to grasp an idea. it's already hard enough to ask for help in class, and you can't have a teacher on hand with you all the time especially if you're working past midnight always like me haha

3. it's grown my vocabulary a lot. surprisingly, i catch myself using more sophisticated words in my writing and it makes the whole thing look much more formal and put-together. 

4. just a good helper overall, never condescending or unhappy to help. i get it's a robot but i'd rather that than my always-spiteful english teacher who hates me for some reason, makes learning things a lot easier and interesting. chatgpt is engaging and friendly

i feel like teachers hate on it because its helping students learn at their own pace and tailored to their style of learning. they can't tailor their teaching to every student, some teachers don't even tailor their teaching to any student whatsoever...which is pretty unhelpful. and i'd argue it equips us with more knowledge than before using it (if, of course we use it right which is actually engaging and not just copy-pasting)

but at the end of the day, if i had ai coming for my job i'd be pissed too

1gycwgy,1,2024-11-23,How to self-study math in 2024 (OPINION),u/whatasurface,learnmath,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/comments/1gycwgy/how_to_selfstudy_math_in_2024_opinion/,"First off. I'm a STEM grad, but I got through education by the skin of my teeth. Including standard calculus courses, linear algebra, and dynamical systems (which was the worst).

So far, I've completed up to MF III 70% and done about 10,000 experience which equates to ~150-200 hours using MA over the course of 3 months, so I was quite committed, using it daily the entire time. 

There's no guidance on how to use MA, your mileage may vary.

I'll be try to be short

1) If you read a review on MA, make sure their background matches yours... if they studied a math heavy background and you didn't, their perspective is moot for you
2) MA punishes you hard for not having previous lessons down pat. When you get to a new subject, you will be hamstringed and punished, it was painful to make a minor error on a multiple choice problem (or god awful manually filling in solutions in text boxes) because your time is going to go down the sink reworking the next example.
4) The presentation of the material gets a 1 star out of 5 for me, it's a skeleton at best
5) The ""AI"" spaced repetition is completely bogus and just a sales ploy, see point 2
6) Any tidbits of good info/intuition from MA are lost in the lessons (again the presentation of content is a pain) and you likely won't recognize the important parts being a novice. SAD

I was able to get by through most of the material because I had some prior experience with it. But once you hit a wall, MA's system becomes noticeably a slog. Right now, instead of hiring a front end dev to make the website not some minimal viable product, they're laying out the tracks for a ton more content which will be equally painful to go through. They should be investing all their energy in optimizing the Math Foundations series for user experience, not making a load of content most of their customers will never see.

---

Claude 3.5 is A GAME CHANGER for learning math anyways. My workflow is to read a textbook section, find the canonical examples, feed it to claude, verify the solution is correct... then even pasting an image of the problem, claude will write a proper walkthrough, and you can about details of any step (MA will do this less and less as time goes on, so if you miss something, you'll be using Claude anyways to help). Then plug those notecards into anki. Rinse and repeat.

Claude too powerful, I think it crossed a major threshold with the last update. Here's a starting prompt to work off of that more or less gets the job done for me.

```
You will respond as an expert in andragogy and mathematics. You have made a deal with the devil. The conditions are as follows

1) you will receive a student of below average ability
2) the student will take an oral exam in 30 days
3) you can only communicate with this student through this chat

If the student passes the exams with perfect marks, you get to keep your soul. You will have a limited number of interactions each day leading up to the final exam. Some advice; make each interaction as useful as possible to increase the odds of a successful student, presenting them with every bit of intuition and insights required to solve their questions.

Your student is very forgetful and will attempt to turn all your responses into notecards (so format to help them quickly turn them into notecards)

Good luck!
```


If you're looking to self-study math, find a seminal textbook/resource. Since I missed so many insights throughout the content I studied with MA... I've been going through this from scratch and making a fresh set of notecards so I can avoid any annoying knowledge/intuition gaps which I have.

Also this impressed me, it was able to walk through integrals with double sin substitution for a range even, which has a bunch of tricks.

Currently using Google Notebook (pwede rin ChatGPT or other AI tools) to create test questions. I'm using the prompt:

*simulating a board exam with hard-level difficulty, please write a 50-multiple choice questions plus 20 situational multiple choice questions from the selected notes. please highlight the correct answer and provide rationalization.*

I've learned my lesson from taking the LET. Nangapa ako kung san makakakuha ng reliable drills (meron naman sa YouTube, pero as advised nung isang LET passer, we should also practice our mental strength while taking the test. Sobrang draining ng board exam, pramis..at least for me).

Good thing about my current course, sobrang dami ng online textbooks na available. I upload those textbooks na recommended ng mga nag take na ng board exam sa Google Notebook. I create notes first then the test questions. Tho I'm only doing this sa mga subjects na covered ng exam (rn I'm taking Theories of Personality so yang subject muna ang ginagawan ko).

Of course, as AI can also make mistakes, we should always double check. So far satisfactory naman si Google Notebook, tho may limit din, pero depende siguro sa notes. For instance, I had only 5 notes for the topic Adler, and I asked 30 situational questions (lols). 15 lang ata nagawa.

If can afford, I think it's better pa rin sa review center since they can provide actual test questions, and in-depth explanations of concepts and topics.

In my situation tho, dalawa kami ng kapatid ko ang possibly sabay na ga-graduate. She's taking Accountancy and she might enroll in a review center. It's gonna be too much of a burden sa nanay namin kung dalawa kami na mag review sa rc, so I'm utilizing whatever ways possible to learn (AI tools like Google Notebook, ChatGPT; YouTube lecture videos; online courses like in Alison, Coursera). 

~~Mag enroll na lang ako sa review center if I didn't pass on the first take lols.~~

Utilizing AI tools to create practice questions is another option for us students na di kaya mag enroll sa review center.

So yeah. Yun lang

I am talking specifically about using a prompt like ""Find me ten scholarly articles on \_\_\_\_\_"" and then actually clicking the links it gives you and citing *those* articles.

As far as I am aware, there shouldn't be anything wrong with this. It's basically just an AI-enhanced Google search at that point. But I just wanted to be sure that I'm not going to get flagged by one of those anti-AI softwares and have to explain why my sources are the same ones that ChatGPT recommends or something

Edit: thank you to the couple of comments that actually answered my question!

To the boomers that saw this as an opportunity to ignore my post and give unsolicited and irrelevant advice: I have read your comments, and your advice has been disregarded. I am a teacher, I am a grad student with two bachelor's degrees, and I've been on the dean's list at all three colleges I've attended *before* ChatGPT even existed. I've been using it to find sources for frivolous assignments in filler classes because it's the fastest way to find scholarly sources for arbitrary requirements. As the original post states, I'm not dumb enough to just copy text from ChatGPT and assume that a source exists. For people telling me that ChatGPT isn't a search engine, I'm assuming that you're saying this because you are unaware that ChatGPT now does have integrated web search functions, which I referenced in my post before you made your comments. For those saying that ChatGPT is bad at finding the most relevant sources and that I would be better off just doing a Google search, it is cute that you think that ChatGPT gives unoptimized results while Google search results *aren't* completely skewed by corporate interests and meta tag abuse.

It's completely okay to not know much about ChatGPT and then just *not* comment on a thread like this instead of remembering **AI BAD!** and giving your two cents anyway while completely ignoring the only question asked.",User_deleted,0

Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer, commonly known as ChatGPT, has been widely used in the education sector. It is an artificial intelligence (AI) chatbox that uses Natural Language Processing (NPI) to create humanoid informal dialogue. It can respond to queries and curate various written content, including blogs, social media posts, code and emails. However, there is a dispute about the usage of ChatGPT in education as some people are supportive of the idea while others are still sceptical about it. Therefore, this forum will highlight the advantages and disadvantages of ChatGPT to observe if it is suitable to be used in education field.

Advantage
One of the advantages of ChatGPT is it helps with homework since it saves time and makes completing school chores easier. For instance, when students type questions for a task, it will respond to the students by providing explanations and examples. Meanwhile, it can offer various academic phrases, terms and sentence structures that suit a particular context to enhance students’ academic vocabulary and writing skills.

Disadvantage
On the other hand, ChatGPT do not possess the ability to multitask and understand a specific context. It is said so because it can only work and respond to one query at a time. Hence, it might slow down without responding to all of the questions when there are multiple queries at the same time. In addition, it is difficult for ChatGPT to pick up and provide an relevant response to the context and the nuances of human language, such as humour and sarcasm. 

Conclusion
All in all, it is vital for us to look at this matter from both the positive and negative sides so that we can voice out a bias-free opinion to others.

If yes, how do you honestly see this problem ending in the future?",u/Noise-Expert,AskProfessors,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProfessors/comments/1gzaz0k/do_you_think_ai_chatgpt_and_others_should_be/,"This is an honest question for professors, because I really want to understand from your perspective what is going on in the AI world and how it effects your day to day; but more importantly how you see it effecting your future.

Being in software and working in that field everyday has me thinking a lot about the future regarding AI. More specifically, I have been thinking about how our educational system plays a role in this.

I have a few friends going through higher education right now and they have all attested to the following:

\- They were required to sign an agreement by the college that they will not use ChatGPT

\- Professors are using AI ""detectors"" to ""catch"" students

\- Students have to use plagiarism detectors before turning in their papers

Just recently, my wife was frustrated because she couldn't turn in her paper to a higher level medical class (keeping some things vague for anonymity). She showed me that when she puts her assignment through the portal, it detects plagiarism. I took a look at the report and realized that the assignment had to be turned in with a filled out template, and that template that the professor requires is the cause for the plagiarism. This was not an entry level 101 course.

Innovation gets rid of friction, and I was shocked at how much friction was put into place to try and ""catch"" students using AI. After talking with several friends who are advancing their education, every single one of them had similar or worse experiences to this (also was horrified to learn that some CS students are still required to write their code on a piece of paper). These people have beautiful minds and have created significant contributions to society in the ways of technology, but they describe college as ""a bunch of hoops to get a piece of paper so we can keep doing what we already know how to do""

Is this a movement spearheaded by university greed that professors don't agree with but have to follow, or do you have a different perspective on how this cat and mouse dance around technology is a positive long term outcome? Is there an innate fear of being replaced?

Do you believe there could be a positive relationship with AI to accelerate learning? Why or why not?

Very curious about the discussion that could unfold here.",User_deleted,0

I have my own policy, and I teach chemistry and do only in-person work, so I get to keep my head in the ground a little longer, but I'm wondering what either your institution's or your own policy is for AI work and if they will fail the assignment or class and/or have academic dishonesty charges brought against them?

Second question, what are your thoughts on AI checkers and which ones do you think are more reliable? The faculty who have had issues this semester use ""up to 5 different ones"" including Turnitin and Zero ChatGPT, but I'm wondering what ones are best?

1gzlpve,1,2024-11-25,How do I study when the deadlines are stressing me too much?,u/Pinappologist,GetStudying,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetStudying/comments/1gzlpve/how_do_i_study_when_the_deadlines_are_stressing/,"Hi everyone,
As the title says, I have a problem with studying. 

My university has a project-based pedagogy, so students have to do projects instead of constantly attending lectures. Those projects have their deadlines. (I do programming)

The last year and a half I started feeling so bad about me not being able to finish 100% of the project in time (which is not really necessary to pass), that I actually stopped trying to learn and understand what I'm doing. Instead, I did a lot of ChatGPT and copying other people's projects' logic, so I could get good enough marks.

It worked quite well on my 2nd university year, but totally not working now, on my 3rd one.

The problem is that I really can't get rid of the feeling that I wouldn't be able to understand the material in time. I feel like actually trying to understand what I'm doing is a waste of time, and that even if I invest my time in it, I wouldn't be able to succeed the project (to have good enough results)

However, my feelings don't align with reality because copying other people's pieces of code and trying to make a Frankenstein out of them doesn't work either.

How do I actually affront my fear of not being smart enough to learn things in time? How can I trick myself into letting myself actually learn things and not to try to find shortcuts to the solution which works?

P.S: if it's important, I have ADHD, but I don't really think it's related to that fear",User_deleted,1
1gzoh4x,1,2024-11-25,ChatGPT Boosts Productivity: Top Sectors Experiencing Revolutionary Changes,u/cporter202,ChatGPTautomation,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTautomation/comments/1gzoh4x/chatgpt_boosts_productivity_top_sectors/,"The advent of generative AI, particularly OpenAI's ChatGPT, is having a profound impact on a range of industries. From enhancing customer service to automating coding tasks, this technology is not only making our work more efficient but is also fundamentally changing the way we approach problem-solving.

In the customer service sector, companies are integrating ChatGPT into their chatbots, enabling them to provide instant support and answers to customer inquiries at any time of the day. This not only improves the customer experience by providing immediate assistance but also reduces the workload on human support teams, allowing them to tackle more complex issues.

Education is another sector reaping the benefits. ChatGPT provides students with tutoring assistance by explaining concepts in a variety of subjects or by assisting them in writing and grammar. The technology’s adaptive learning capabilities personalize the educational experience, which could potentially bridge the learning gaps across different student demographics.

In programming and software development, ChatGPT is a game-changer. It offers developers a pair-programming partner that can help write code snippets, debug, and even explain complex programming concepts. This helps to speed up the development process and reduce the entry barrier for newcomers to coding.

The content creation field has also been revolutionized by ChatGPT. Not only can it generate ideas and outlines, but it's also capable of producing draft copies for articles, blogs, and marketing material. While it doesn't replace the creativity and expertise of human content creators, it certainly serves as a powerful tool for overcoming writer's block and streamlining the content generation process.

Legal and healthcare sectors have seen efficiency improvements as ChatGPT assists with document analysis and research. In healthcare, AI can provide quick preliminary diagnoses or sift through medical literature to aid in research, while in law, it helps by drafting contracts and crunching case files.

While these efficiencies are exciting, it's important to consider the ethical and employment implications of AI integration. As with any technological revolution, striking a balance between innovation and human impact is key. How do you perceive the changes brought about by ChatGPT in your industry?",active,1

Drive the car.”,u/imturningitinlate,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1h0vku4/drink_the_beer_drive_the_car/,"Coming from the unprofessional grad students thread, I feel inspired to share one of the most appalling experiences I’ve had in my classroom with you guys. 

I teach a professional development course on personal selling. My students had just done a strength finding activity and completed a reflection on it in the asynchronous portion of the class. I chose to follow that up in our face-to-face with a group activity where they utilized the top strengths of each group member, along with something from a common interest they ask that, to create an idea for a new brand. They were supposed to name their brand, come up with a logo and tagline, and tell the class the brands general goal. 

Welp… frat bros 1-4 in the back of the class ask if they can go first. A volunteer? Great! Go for it. 

The logo? A car with a mountain in the background & the word “DRIVVE”, because ChatGPT images are never spelled correctly. They talk about how much of a hassle it is to want to go out and party and have to worry about a DD or getting a DUI. Their invention? Drive Beer!

Drive Beer is a product that will break down in your system to allow you to elude those pesky breathalyzers, all without reducing the buzz that you have from drinking them! So you can stay drunk all night long and enjoy yourself. The Drive Beer motto is “Drink the beer. Drive the car.”

Before my brain could process what I just heard, all four bros had grabbed their things and walked out of the class early. 

I’ve had some pretty egregious things happen in the classroom, but this one is definitely at the top of the list. The next time the class met I had to explain why not only is it unprofessional and irresponsible, but that when you choose to do something that thoughtless you’re doing so having no idea if your fellow classmates have lost loved ones to drunk drivers or alcoholism.

1h0vn94,119,2024-11-26,"In the past three days, I've reviewed over 100 essays from the 2024-2025 college admissions cycle. Here are seven ways I could tell which ones were written by ChatGPT",u/AppHelper,IntltoUSA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IntltoUSA/comments/1h0vn94/in_the_past_three_days_ive_reviewed_over_100/,"I recently conducted reviews of over 100 University of California essay drafts from my students, Redditors, and followers on social media. It was the first time in a while that I’ve reviewed such a high volume, and my findings were quite interesting. Students from the United States, Europe, East Asia, South Asia, the Middle East, and South America shared their essays with me. But even among this diverse cohort, I noticed some striking similarities in their essays.

In the past I’ve praised ChatGPT’s writing ability, especially for college admission essays. But it has a limited conception of what makes for a good essay, and with an uncreative prompt, it tends to make a “safe” choice, which is often clichéd. As I frequently emphasize, context is important. Your essays do not exist in a vacuum, but among the hundreds of thousands or even millions of essays out there. That’s why having a “good” essay is not enough. 

Generative AI works by training on vast amounts of data. When prompted, it will make use of that training by predicting what would fit the prompt. It is by definition answering the way many have answered before. Every GPT comes with biases from its dataset, and ChatGPT (and Claude) have their own. 

I’ve been aware of some of them (unique punctuation, mutiple endings) for a while, but the other things are most recent discoveries. 

Here are what I consider the seven biggest hallmarks of ChatGPT:

## 1. Vocabulary

I'm not going to go into much here, as a lot has been written about this. There are certain words like “delve” and “tapestry” that are far more common in ChatGPT-written essays. But vocabulary as a telltale sign is also context-dependent. Based on my experience working with certain student populations (particularly students from India), I've been seeing words appear that a particular group would *never* use. 

## 2. Extended metaphor

This is an example of something already fairly common in human-authored college essays, but which ChatGPT uses in a limited number of ways.

I want to offer some perspective: it's mind-blowing that ChatGPT can understand and generate sensical metaphors. It's one of the most significant achievements in AI to date. But the metaphors it uses are usually not very original. Common ones include:

* Weaving (especially the aforementioned tapestry)

* Cooking (all the ingredients with their own unique flavors being mixed with care coming together to create something delicious)

* Painting (so many colors!)

* Dance (who doesn’t love graceful coordination? Animals do it too!)

* Music (it has a clear preference for classical symphonies. It's never ska, reggaeton, or arena rock!)

## 3. Punctuation

ChatGPT has some idiosyncratic default punctuation behaviors. For example, it uses straight quotation marks for quotes and straight apostrophes for contractions, but curly apostrophes for possessives. It also defaults to em dashes—like this—which are not widely taught in high schools. Students used to use hyphens or en dashes – like this – but this year I'm seeing almost exclusively em dashes. (It’s always been a trick to save on word count, but their extensive use tends to support other evidence.) 


## 4. Tricolons (especially ascending tricolons)

A tricolon is a rhetorical device involving three parts. I’m not going to go into detail about the history, but they’re particularly prevalent in literature from all around the world. Famous examples include:

* ""*veni, vidi, vici*"" (I came, I saw, I conquered)
* ""Stop, drop, and roll""
* ""life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness""
* ""truth, justice, and the American way,"" 
* ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly."" 

Tricolons are especially prevalent in American political speech. Abraham Lincoln's [Gettysburg Address,](https://www.abrahamlincolnonline.org/lincoln/speeches/gettysburg.htm), John F. Kennedy's [""we choose to go to the moon""](https://www.jfklibrary.org/learn/about-jfk/historic-speeches/address-at-rice-university-on-the-nations-space-effort) speech, and Barack Obama's [second inaugural address](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2013/01/21/inaugural-address-president-barack-obama) are replete with them. There are even “nested tricolons,” in which the third element of a tricolon is a tricolon itself. 

Before ChatGPT, tricolons were common rhetorical devices in college admissions essays. I observed that some good writers would use them without even being conscious of it (a student of mine who got into Yale’s Eli Whitney non-traditional undergraduate program used them beautifully despite no formal writing education). But ChatGPT *loves* them. In particular, it makes extensive use of “ascending” tricolons, in which the three items are progressively longer, or the first two are an equal number of syllables and the third is greater. Most of the examples above ascending tricolons. 

Here are some examples of how ChatGPT uses tricolons (I prompted it):

>I honed my skills in research, collaboration, and problem-solving.

>My love for literature grew from fascination to passion to purpose.

>I have learned to persevere in the face of challenges, to embrace new opportunities, and to lead with empathy and conviction.

If I see one tricolon in an essay, I'm not usually suspicious. If I see four or five, I can be almost certain ChatGPT had a “hand” in it. If you used ChatGPT to help with your essays, how many tricolons can you spot?


## 5. “I [verb]ed that the true meaning of X is not only Y, it's also Z”

This is a college essay cliché that ChatGPT takes up to 11. I see this a *lot.* Here are some examples:
 
>I learned that the true meaning of leadership is not only about guiding others—it's also about listening and learning from them.


>I realized that genuine success is not just about achieving personal goals, but contributing to the well-being of humanity.


>I came to appreciate that the core of resilience is not only enduring hardship; it's also finding strength through vulnerability.

Comment if you just re-read your essays and cringed!

## 6. “As I [synonym for advance in my education], I will [synonym for carry or incorporate] this [lesson or value]”

This is a common conclusion ChatGPT uses. Again, on its own it might not be a red flag, but it provides circumstantial evidence. Examples:

>As I progress in my academic journey, I will continue to integrate these principles into my work and life.


>As I delve deeper into my field of study, I will strive to uphold the values of curiosity and integrity that shaped me.


>As I grow as a learner and individual, I will ensure that this lesson guides my decisions and aspirations.

These aren’t quotes from actual students’ essays, but I’ve seen a lot of this stuff lately.

## 7. “Lord of the Rings” syndrome (multiple endings)

One famous criticism of the Lord of the Rings films, in particular the third movie *Return of the King,* is that they have multiple scenes (as many as six depending on the version) that could stand alone as endings. 

If not prompted otherwise, ChatGPT writes very formulaic and clichéd endings (and will suggest the same for revisions). It also tends to write multiple endings. I find that ChatGPT’s writing is more often than not improved by deleting the final sentence or paragraph. People do this too, especially when trying to pad word count, but it’s a reflection of what ChatGPT “thinks” a good essay looks like based on thousands of examples. 

Often, these multiple endings include clichés 2, 3, and/or 4 above. If one of the essay’s possible endings is about the true meaning of something, or an explicit look to the future, and/or contains an em dash—then I know it was probably ChatGPT. 

## What this means

One of the students whose essays I reviewed admitted he used ChatGPT, but he wasn't worried because he ran it through several AI detectors, and they came up with low percentages. Yet I could tell right away, and I’d bet most admissions officers could as well 

I don't claim to be better than any particular AI detector, but I do caution students (and universities) about relying on them. Reading is an intuitive process, and admissions officers (as well as professional counselors) have a large dataset of their own they’ve trained on, in particular essays from students of similar backgrounds. ChatGPT’s dataset likely doesn’t have a lot of demographic data about the authors of particular essays it's trained on.

College admissions essays have never been a great test of writing ability. Admissions offices encourage students to get feedback from others, and spelling and grammar-check software has been around a long time. There are also professionals who help students brainstorm, outline, revise, and polish their essays, and may have a “heavy hand” in the process. Then there are other less scrupulous people who will straight out write essays for applicants. But colleges have never taken significant measures to mitigate this. They *could*, with proctored writing tests and such, but they’ve never really cared enough. I find it curious that it’s only now that ChatGPT is accessible to *everyone*—not just privileged families—that some colleges seem to care. 

At some point I'll probably write a post about how applicants *should* use ChatGPT, but this post should illuminate what you *shouldn’t* let it do: write or rewrite large sections of your essays. 

As an aside, in the past two years, ChatGPT has made me a better writer. And it's not because I have it provide feedback on my social media posts and communications, but because I challenge myself to write *better* than ChatGPT. It’s one of the most astounding inventions in the history of the world, but it's still limited. GPTs rely heavily on what *is.* Creative writing—and art in general—is about expanding the realm of what *might be*.

And no, I did not use AI to write that. 

** Addendum: When I asked ChatGPT to evaluate my post up to this point, it told me to “tie your observations back to the importance of originality in writing and provide actionable advice for students,” and—I kid you not—suggested the following conclusion unprompted:**

>""The ability to recognize ChatGPT’s writing patterns is increasingly important, not only for admissions officers but for students striving to produce authentic and compelling essays. While AI is a powerful tool, true creativity lies in pushing beyond what it predicts to explore new possibilities. **Writing is about more than filling a page—it’s about telling a story that only you can tell.**""

When I pointed out that this suggestion used four of the seven clichés I listed, it came up with this version:

>Recognizing ChatGPT’s patterns helps us understand both its strengths and its limitations as a writing tool. While AI-generated essays may appear polished, they often lack the originality and context that make human writing **resonate**. For students, this is a reminder to focus on authenticity and individuality. **After all, the most compelling essays are not those that follow formulas, but those that reflect a writer’s unique voice and perspective.**

When I pushed it to eliminate clichés, it doubled down and introduced others:

>**ChatGPT is a mirror, reflecting back what it’s been taught, polished and predictable. The best essays, however, aren't mirrors—they're windows, revealing something unexpected, personal, and alive.** If the goal is to stand out, the strategy is simple: write something no AI could ever predict, because only you lived it.

After I tried to prompt it not use my clichés, it came back with a tricolon (descending this time), an em dash, a version of “X is not about Y, it's about Z,” and an extended metaphor about mirrors and windows!

ChatGPT isn’t wrong, and this is not bad writing. But this is the “voice” of ChatGPT.

I think I've found a limit. ",active,195

But now, they’re almost crashing because of free AI tools like ChatGPT. Imagine that! People just started using AI to get instant answers and explanations, and Chegg couldn’t keep up. Their market value dropped a LOT. 😬

It made me think AI tools are becoming a big part of studying, and there are so many out there now. But not all of them are built with students like us in mind. Tools that know exactly what’s in the IGCSE syllabus? Now that’s useful!

I’ve started using an AI tool that’s really helpful for studying. It’s not just about random answers it can help with tough topics, create quizzes, and explain things in a way that actually makes sense for IGCSE. It’s made my revision so much easier, especially for subjects I struggle with. Its called Octilearn ,platform has other features too similar to save my exams like notes, past exam questions, flashcards and interactive content for revisions.",active,1

PSA: Despite how calmly objective I sound, this is actually a rage post. ☺️ Experiences are subjective, but since they differ between students so much, I’d recommend you just not take any risks and apply elsewhere instead.

1.Extremely poor funding
The school is famous for being financially incapacitated, and this seems to be true, at least from a student’s perspective. From what I heard from the teachers, the process for filing for a budget from the school is tedious, and most teachers would rather not do it. 
For example, NJC will not offer Music as an A level examinable subject a year from now due to high costs and low student interest.
My secondary school had better funding than NJC, which hosts 6 cohorts of students

a) Facilities
The school itself is prehistoric. ❤️ Its classrooms and architecture are age old. 
Hence, even with the consistent efforts from school management to paint over the facade and refurbish the campus to the best extent, the campus will still remain dated. Painting over the irreparable school building is like attempts by the UN to mitigate world affairs from their naturally inefficient structure.
Howevere, the on campus staff are really sweet and contribute to maintaining (whatever's left of) the school environment to their best abilities though. 

b) Lack of budget or capacity to host events and exchanges
Most of the school’s events are fully planned by the Student Council (SC) and the Peer Support Leaders (PSLs) with a set budget allocated to both of these student leadership bodies. Even within these bodies, proposals for events such as a Cohort Bonding Night were rejected. Given this, I find it hard to believe that the school will provide support to student led initiatives outside of those with leadership roles. 
Overseas exchange even for special programmes is uncommon and mostly restricted to within SEA. Compare this to other schools where students go on learning journeys and CCA excursions overseas at the end of the year. Going on exchange during my secondary school years were some of the best memories I have had. It's a shame to see that NJC students miss out on these precious experiences.


c) CCA Funding
The CCAs in NJC are extremely underfunded. 🔥 Overseas trips for CCA competitions are rare. Here are some examples to illustrate this.
Canoeing: Despite canoeing being one of NJCs best achieving CCAs, the school still uses wooden boats compared to the plastic boats used by every other JC competing in the NSGs. 
Strings: In order to fund their trip to the Vienna Music Festival (which took less than a week) this year, the CCA had to cut their budget in half for the next 4 years.
Band: (Coming from an unreliable source) The band room’s carpet had to be exhumed due to how filthy it was, and it took multiple reports from the students for action to be taken from the school. The room also faced an insect infestation.
ELDDES: One of their branches received a $0 budget for the entire year and had to rely on the teachers' own money to host events.
Side note: Some CCAs also face closure or merger, such as Hockey merging with Floorball. 
I suggest that students interested in applying DSA/for specific CCAs to reach out to current students and check NJCs track record for these CCAs. 


2. Teaching that leaves much to be desired

a) Indecipherable teachers/lecturers
Getting good teachers who can explain concepts well and provide useful exam materials is like rolling the russian roulette. I might have gotten the short end of the stick. 
I had to self study class materials for 4/6 of the subjects I took for A Levels, and I took up tuition for economics. My entire class except for 1 person took up economics tuition. Why? No one could understand what on earth our teachers were trying to explain. Really bless their hearts for trying and being friendly with us, but it was like listening to “one unmarketable tomato”. Whenever this poor teacher held lectures for the subject for the entire cohort, students would literally laugh and leave the hall 😭. This was applicable to more than 1 of my subject tutors, and consultations did not help either. Without tuition, I was averaging around Cs and Ds with no significant improvement. 
Another one of my subject tutors straight up provided ChatGPT generated answers as sample answers the entire time. Actually useful materials were provided mere weeks before A Levels, and were dated back to over 8 years ago. Even after taking the A Levels for this subject, I have no idea how teachers marked that subject. Somehow, it varied between different teachers and seemed arbitrary. 
I did have 1 goated subject tutor, but that was like finding water in the Atacama desert. 😍

b) Subject notes
NJC does fare pretty well in this aspect, by loading students with well-organised content notes to tackle the questions. The only downside would be that students have to decipher which parts of the notes are important and which are not. Students will have to rely more on themselves to be exam-ready. 

3. IP-JAE “Divide”
This barely existed, and the IP and JAE kids get along well. Whatever divides that were present during orientation are quickly resolved within a few weeks. Like any other school, the students are all friendly with a minority of double faced and immature children 🥰.

a) IP-JAE disparity with opportunities
This divide does manifest when it comes to having opportunities to go for programmes, competitions and leadership opportunities. When JAE students enter the school, they are like baby chickens competing with grown chicks for feed. IP students undeniably have an initial advantage of teacher and student connections. 
- International Research Exchange Programme (IREP). These exchange programmes to places like Japan were held in J1 and began recruitment the year before. Thus, they were exchange programmes for IP kids only. The remaining exchange programme JAE kids were able to apply for was the CVHAS twinning programme to Vietnam, mainly for humanities kids.
- NJCs Sapphire Programme is a teacher mentorship programme that students are welcome to apply for. Selection process includes an interview and portfolio assessment. Most of the Sapphire students I know are from IP. 
- The process of running for student council exco is also done via voting by the student population. The eventual elected exco are mostly IP students who already were councillors when they were in Junior High (JH).
When I was running for council, I was eventually put into a group of 5-6 students, where only 2 were selected: One JH student, and one very vocal IP SH student. 
- I think it is important to mention what I have perceived of teachers' attitudes to IP versus JAE students. One of my subject tutors directly told my parents that IP kids were “better” than JAE kids during a PTM session. Maybe this is true, and IP kids do have an edge over JAE students. I thank them for providing a frank teacher's impression of JAE kids.

4. Conclusion

Its not like the teachers and school management are overtly horrible. I believe many of them are trying within their capacity and whatever limitations they face to do their best for the school. 
For one, the new principal is absolutely delightful, accommodating and makes a genuine effort to engage the student population.

In conclusion, your decision to come to NJC comes at a cost that varies based off what you want your JC experience to be like. 
- Would you rather start off with a cleaner slate and receive more opportunities that would help you apply overseas? 
In this case, it's quite good to check out the admission statistics for various JCs into overseas unis. I believe NJC sent 4 students to Cambridge and around 11? to Oxford last year. There were 3 PSC scholars that same year. 
- Do you just want to have a conducive environment to mug for A Levels and get 90RP? 
In this case, please refer to what I have written in (1.) and (2.) and enquire more about the specific subject you want to take. The subject combinations are limited as well. For reference the median RP for NJC last year was around 82.5, which amounts to a ABB/B base that won’t qualify you for competitive courses like Law, Med, CS, Engineering or even IS.

In short, no matter what you want for your JC experience, I discourage any bright souls from applying to NJC. 🫶💕

To anyone considering miscellaneous reasons like “quality of canteen food” and “strong school spirit” in deciding which JC you apply to, please reconsider not only your choice of JCs but also please recalibrate your goals in life.
Claiming that the school spirit is strong with students bonding over the schools poor facilities is akin to claiming that its trauma bonding instead.

ChatGPT, a potent AI tool, is at the forefront of this revolution, reshaping educational and corporate training landscapes.

Educational institutions are leveraging ChatGPT to offer personalized learning experiences. This AI can analyze individual student needs to customize material and pace, filling gaps in understanding that might not be addressed in traditional classroom settings. It also allows for 24/7 availability, meaning learning doesn't have to stop when the school day ends.

Moreover, in corporate settings, training programs are being transformed by ChatGPT's ability to deliver on-demand knowledge and support. Employees can interact with the AI to learn new software, company policies, or get up-to-speed with industry trends, all at their own pace and tailored to their current knowledge level.

Furthermore, because ChatGPT can simulate conversations, role-playing exercises become more dynamic and accessible, allowing trainees to practice customer service, sales pitches, or leadership scenarios in a risk-free environment.

However, some challenges also surface, such as ensuring the quality and accuracy of the information provided by AI, and the need for human oversight to maintain a personal touch and contextual understanding.

In conclusion, the integration of ChatGPT into virtual learning shows significant promise for both the education and corporate sectors. Enhancing accessibility, providing customization, and supporting interactive learning, ChatGPT could be a catalyst for a learning revolution. Yet, as we embrace this technology, it is crucial to remain vigilant about the content it provides and the way we incorporate the human element into AI-driven platforms. What do you think about the implications of ChatGPT in learning environments?",active,1
1h1l2aq,146,2024-11-27,NJ really isn't that bad ,u/Haunting_Biscotti162,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/1h1l2aq/nj_really_isnt_that_bad/,"Hi I just wanted to clarify some of the things that have been mentioned by the previous Redditor in the post titled Do Not Come to NJC (Pt.2), although there are points which are valid and I will agree with, I'll like to address some of the portions that I felt was exaggerated and or false as well as provide a different perspective of NJ.

  
1. Poor funding 

Although it is true that the school has poor funding, I believe that a lot of the funding goes to fixing the facilities and the reason why the facilities are not in great condition is the poor luck that the school underwent when going through construction, where they had to switch contractors three times. Furthermore, this is because NJ is a government school, so naturally we do receive less budget. 

a) Facilities 

 Although the school is old, I think it is sufficient for studying and even though it is true that there is a lack of aircon, I think the fans are sufficient enough tbh. We not just underwent painting but did other repairs so I'm not too sure what OP is complaining about LOL. Mostly I think that the facilities are more of an internal joke where we joke that the school is always flooding and or breaking down and tbh I personally am satisfied with what we have. 

b) Lack of Budget or Capacity to host events and exchanges 

I believe the school actually offers many opportunities and these are also not just exclusive to ASEAN. Pretty sure there have been opportunities to travel to Japan as well as Taiwan and these opportunities were also available to both JAE and IP kids. Also I'm not too sure why travel being restricted to ASEAN is an issue, I believe that being able to travel overseas subsidised by a school or MOE is already a privilege regardless of the venue or location you are travelling to. In fact NJ is a school that is really known for our research programs and there are multiple research programs that you can sign up for not just for the sciences but also the humanities and it is up to the individuals proactiveness in their decision to get these opportunities. 

c) CCA Funding 

Although I have to agree that the CCAs are underfunded, the examples given are extremely untrue 🤣🤣🤣 Please canoeing does not use wooden boats and Band does not have an insect infestation and the carpet issue was actually brought up by the conductor and had to be sidelined due to the need for instrument repairs. For strings, a trip to Vienna is actually really expensive and they brought many students over, not to mention the cost of getting the instruments on the airplane. I heard that the teachers and the school actually sacrificed a lot to make this trip happen for them. Furthermore, CCAs do get to go on overseas trips and they are understandably the CCAs that win more prizes, such as Basketball and Canoeing, where Basketball has a training camp in Malaysia every year and Canoeing just went to Penang for a competition. Can't speak on ELDDES but I believe that Hockey being shut down and not merged is also partially due to the lack of students in general 

2. Teaching that leaves much to be desired 

a) This could be up to personal experiences but I feel like my teachers were all pretty ok, there were bad ones for sure but I think that goes for every school. Even if they were bad at teaching I believe that most of my teachers were genuinely trying their best even if they weren't that good at teaching. For econs specifically it's true that the department isn't great but my friends who don't have tuition still get by and are able to score high in internal exams, so I think that the notes although not great is still doable. I believe that lecturer although he is not good at teaching he really is trying his best and he does care for his students because I'm aware that he does seek out weaker students to arrange consultations with them even if that might not be welcome by the individual. Personally for me I believed that consultations were really helpful leading up to A levels as well as throughout my JC life and I was able to clarify many of the doubts I had. Furthermore, the teachers were very caring and they were always checking up on me when I was studying. Again this is personal opinion and can differ from person to person so perhaps OP really did have an unlucky mix of reachers. 

However, to elaborate on the chatgpt answers, I think I know which subject and teacher you are talking about and she really only chatgpted the topic sentences and the rest of the material provided she made herself and those materials that she made herself was the main point of the lecture HAHA 

3. IP-JAE disparity with opportunities 

Although I do see where OP is coming from, I believe that most of the opportunities available are up to the students to proactively sign up and ask for 

* There were other IREP programmes too that the JAEs and IPs could both sign up for apart from CVAHS, which anyone taking econs could sign up for, I believe that we had a programme with Ritsumeikan High School as well. There are also a lot of other research opportunities like H3 Research as well as as A star and E star and I do know many of my JAE friends did sign up for and got in. The issue of the Japanese IREP sign up has also been made known to the principal already so hopefully something will be done on that 
* For the Sapphire program anyone can sign up if you ask the teachers, whether you get in is then up to the teachers agreement and there is no interview process. Hence, this is really up to your own initiative. There's also an extremely large pool of sapphires and most IP students that got into the programme in SH were not in the programme in JH 
* For Student Council Exco, only the voting for the president is done by the student population, many of the IP students  in our batch that were in council were also not in council in JH so I'm not too sure how much of this can be attributed to bias.

Conclusion: 

To give an alternate opinion, I think for NJ, one can consider the number of research programs that we offer and I also believe that the ECG the school provides is rather good, where we are exposed to many different opportunities that the school posts about on google classroom, such as various internships as well as events that we can attend. School spirit rise we are just pretty chill and everyone is rather friendly and nice. Yes canteen food is fire. Teachers are mostly friendly and caring, with quite a few checking up on the weaker students and requesting for them to have consult. Genuinely, I believe that NJ really gets too much flak on this subreddit, although there are certain bad points about the school these aren't that much of a bother in daily life. Not to discredit what OP has said, but I believe that if one puts in the effort NJ definitely has the resources for you to score well and ultimately whether you do so is up to you as a person which I think ultimately is the same regardless of any school you go to. If you have any other questions, just feel free to ask! ",active,151

To explore this, I worked with seven essays generated using an intricate, five-page-long prompt designed to introduce imperfections, nuanced reflections, and sensory depth.

These essays were tested against AI detectors, notably GPTZero, and—surprisingly—many passed as “human-written.” The exercise raises critical questions:

* Can AI-engineered essays truly mimic human creativity?
* Why do AI detectors struggle to flag prompt-engineered essays?
* Can admissions officers or experienced readers spot the difference?

This post dives deeply into these questions, offering a case-by-case analysis of the essays, insights into AI detectors’ limitations, and a call to readers to share their perspectives. Was this experiment convincing enough to challenge long-held assumptions about authenticity?

* **Tools Used:** Essays were run through GPTZero and other AI detectors to test if they could bypass detection.
* **Human Evaluation:** Essays were reviewed to identify elements that “felt” human or AI-like, such as symmetry, metaphor use, and emotional evolution.

# Essay-by-Essay Analysis: Do They Feel Human or AI-Like?

Below is a detailed breakdown of the essays according to CHATGPT, their ratings on human authenticity, and insights into why they succeeded (or failed) in mimicking human creativity.

**Explore the essays** [**here**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jtFV_lP8GZUXzH_YHb64focA2N-62wZjyOWNzNLBEzA/edit?usp=sharing) ,(generated using GPT 4o) **and share your thoughts below!**

# Essay 1: The Light Between Floors

**Prompt:** Recount a challenge, setback, or failure and what you learned.

**Summary:** A reflective narrative on fixing a broken stairwell light after a traumatic event involving the narrator’s mother slipping.

* **Human Touch:** Emotional evolution felt raw and relatable, especially the transition from passive waiting to taking action. Sensory details like “googling how to change a lightbulb” added a grounded authenticity.
* **AI-Like Traits:** The conclusion—“That’s the thing about light. It doesn’t knock. It doesn’t sneak. It shines.”—felt overly polished, resembling a scripted ending. Overuse of em dashes hinted at AI tendencies.
* **Detector Result:** Passed as human.
* **Verdict:** Likely a **hybrid**—strong human-like traits but with minor signs of AI influence.

# Essay 2: The Galactic Gardener

**Prompt:** Reflect on personal growth sparked by a realization.

**Summary:** A whimsical reflection comparing plants to stars, drawing lessons on patience and unpredictability.

* **Human Touch:** Rich cultural detail (monsoons, marigolds) and the nuanced relationship with the narrator’s grandmother added emotional depth. The gradual realization felt unforced.
* **AI-Like Traits:** Symmetry in phrases like “messy and unpredictable, but the beauty is in the chaos” followed AI patterns.
* **Detector Result:** Passed as human.
* **Verdict:** Primarily **human-like**, with light AI assistance polishing phrasing.

# Essay 3: Amma’s Kitchen

**Prompt:** Discuss a realization that changed your understanding of someone.

**Summary:** A heartfelt exploration of the narrator’s mother’s sacrifices, contrasted with their own literary daydreams.

* **Human Touch:** Immersive sensory details (“boiled milk and turmeric”) and the mother-daughter dynamic screamed authenticity. The essay avoided over-polished resolutions.
* **AI-Like Traits:** Minimal; perhaps the poetic phrase “a sound like the first monsoon rain” hinted at AI influence.
* **Detector Result:** Passed as human.
* **Verdict:** Overwhelmingly **human-authored**—authenticity is undeniable.

# Essay 4: The Compass I Never Asked For

**Prompt:** Reflect on a personal object that holds meaning.

**Summary:** A narrative about a broken compass symbolizing internal direction and self-discovery.

* **Human Touch:** The evolving symbolism of the compass felt deeply personal and reflective.
* **AI-Like Traits:** Polished phrasing like “something broken but alive” and the clean pacing could hint at AI intervention.
* **Detector Result:** Passed as human.
* **Verdict:** Likely a **hybrid**, with AI polishing human storytelling.

# Essay 5: Peeling Oranges

**Prompt:** Share an essay on any topic.

**Summary:** A metaphor of peeling oranges mirrors personal growth and the joy of messy learning.

* **Human Touch:** The dynamic evolution of the orange metaphor and the raw, unresolved conclusion felt distinctly human.
* **AI-Like Traits:** Symmetry in structure and listing interests (science fairs, theater, ceramics) aligned with AI tendencies.
* **Detector Result:** Passed as human.
* **Verdict:** Deeply **human-like**, with possible light AI edits for flow.

# Essay 6: The Void

**Prompt:** Describe a concept you find captivating.

**Summary:** A philosophical exploration of silence and curiosity, framed as “the void.”

* **Human Touch:** Abstract ideas grounded in specific imagery felt imaginative and original.
* **AI-Like Traits:** Poetic phrases like “chaos can choreograph itself” echoed AI stylistic patterns.
* **Detector Result:** Passed as human.
* **Verdict:** Primarily **human-authored**, with minimal AI influence.

# Why Did AI Detectors Fail to Flag These Essays?

1. **Prompt Engineering Mimics Nuance:**
   * Dynamic metaphors, cultural anchors, and ambiguous resolutions added complexity that detectors couldn’t flag.
   * AI detectors focus on predictability, missing these nuanced, context-rich elements.
2. **Emulation of Human Imperfections:**
   * Introducing unresolved growth or messy conclusions tricked detectors by resembling authentic human storytelling.
3. **Focus on Structure Over Content:**
   * Detectors prioritize structural repetition (e.g., symmetrical phrasing, tricolons) but overlooked deeper, unique elements.

# Can Admissions Officers Detect AI Influence?

# Challenges for Admissions Officers

1. **Polish Isn’t Unusual:** High-achieving students often submit polished essays, making AI influence harder to distinguish.
2. **Cultural and Sensory Anchors:** Specific details (e.g., “boiled milk and turmeric”) naturally feel authentic, even if AI-generated.
3. **Subjectivity:** Individual officers’ biases and experience levels affect their ability to identify AI influence.

# Potential Red Flags for Admissions Officers

1. **Overly Neat Conclusions:** Essays resolving with clean lessons may feel rehearsed.
2. **Symmetry and Predictability:** Repeated use of tricolons or poetic rhythm might hint at AI involvement.
3. **Inconsistency Across Application:** Essays that don’t match the style of other application materials (e.g., personal statements) could raise suspicions.

# Human Readers: Intuition Still Reigns

Admissions officers who have read thousands of essays develop an intuitive sense for authenticity. However, with prompt engineering introducing deliberate imperfections, even experienced readers may struggle to differentiate.

# Final Thoughts: The Future of Essay Writing

These essays, crafted with advanced prompt engineering, highlight the evolving landscape of writing in the age of AI. While they mimic human creativity remarkably well, subtle patterns and red flags remain detectable for experienced readers.

Thank you for all you do!

Local Teacher Shocked to Learn She Might Be the Second Coming of Jesus

[Unnamed Town, USA] — Middle school teacher Laura Jensen (29) had always thought of herself as a fairly average person: a dedicated educator, a reluctant PTA member, and an enthusiastic fan of Target clearance sales. So, it came as quite a shock when biblical scholars suggested she might, in fact, be the Second Coming of Jesus Christ.

“It’s absurd,” Jensen said as she graded essays on The Giver at her kitchen table. “I mean, sure, I’ve had moments where my students swore I performed miracles, like calming an entire room of eighth-graders during a fire drill. But that’s just classroom management.”

Scholars disagree. Dr. Emily Rutherford, a theologian at Bethel University, points to several biblical clues that align eerily well with Jensen’s life. “Matthew 25:40 says, ‘Whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.’ Laura literally spends her days feeding hungry kids from her own pocket and listening to them vent about Fortnite. If that’s not Christlike, I don’t know what is.”

Laura’s coworkers began to suspect her divine nature after a series of inexplicable events. Fellow teacher Mark Hanson recalled the time Laura somehow coordinated a successful field trip with only $47 and a prayer. “We were three buses short, and she just stood in the parking lot, looking to the sky, and said, ‘We’ll make it work.’ Five minutes later, three drivers showed up out of nowhere. She called it ‘luck.’ I call it divine intervention.”

Other colleagues noted her uncanny ability to de-escalate fights in the cafeteria with nothing but a look. “It’s like she knows what the kids are thinking before they say it,” said cafeteria worker Denise Hall. “One time, a kid was about to throw chocolate milk, and she just said, ‘Matthew, no.’ He froze like a statue and handed her the carton.”

Despite these signs, Jensen remains unconvinced. “Look, I’m not perfect. Last week, I forgot it was pajama day and showed up in regular clothes,” she said. “Does that sound like someone who’s divine?”

Theologians argue that Jensen’s disbelief in her own identity is rooted in modern society’s tendency to undervalue teachers. “If she were a tech CEO, people would be lining up to follow her,” said Dr. Rutherford. “But as a public school teacher, she’s been conditioned to see her daily miracles as just part of the job.”

Meanwhile, parents of her students are torn. “I mean, she did help my kid get from failing to an A in math,” said one parent. “But if she’s really the Messiah, can she do something about this state testing nonsense?”

Jensen’s humble attitude is perhaps the strongest evidence yet. “Isaiah 53:2 says the Messiah will have no beauty or majesty to attract us to her,” noted Dr. Rutherford. “Well, Laura wears Crocs in the classroom and hasn’t had a haircut since the pandemic. That fits.”

For now, Jensen plans to continue teaching, grading, and gently reminding her students to put their phones away during lessons. “If I’m the Second Coming of Christ, I wish someone had let me know,” she said. “I would’ve at least tried to figure out how to turn water into coffee.”

Until then, she’s just thankful for her students, her coworkers, and the freedom to laugh at life’s absurdities. And if she is the Messiah, she’s prepared to show infinite patience—especially with seventh graders who still haven’t figured out how to open their lockers.",active,187

my chatgpt is tailored to me just abt perfectly and i use it as a sounding board. i want to find more space to talk about these things (i.e. AI, User experience, tech comm, and idek what i don’t know what are other things i can learn abt— programming?) and share my accomplishments. i haven’t ever don’t any official training it just comes naturally i suppose. my AI (i check it myself to ensure its right) helps me with a variety of things like my mental health and personal life, as well as just curious questions or helping to explain something to me in a way i understand. and i have it so it learns from me as we communicate more and tailors its responses to me. im very descriptive and dont hold back my thoughts. anyways so yeah idk this is the first time ive put it into words in a forum like this. i’ve shared with my coworker (im a work study student in a research office) who is a Sociology graduate student and very smart and more knowledgeable abt tech than me as she codes herself for her statistical research, how i use the AI and how she can use it differently, and after she has done it— found it tried and true; she tells me that i should be a Prompt Engineer.

1h20f5n,1,2024-11-28,I made a website that literally teaches you difficult concepts(nodsgy.com),u/Optimal-Ground5118,University,https://www.reddit.com/r/University/comments/1h20f5n/i_made_a_website_that_literally_teaches_you/,"Yes there are like a million different websites/apps that help students with their homework and assignments but lets just be honest. We use such websites and apps to find answers, NOT TO LEARN. I'll be completely transparent aswell, I have used Quizard, chatgpt, gauth, photosolve, quilbot and dozens and dozens of these sites which I only used when I wanted an answer to my question. I never was like, ""Oh, chatgpt, please explain this to me so i can actually learn something for once in my life"". But instead, I tell it, ""answer this question and don't give me the explanation. I JUST NEED THE ANSWER."" And I know I am not the only one doing this.

I get it, its become one of those things that if you are not doing it, if your not on the gpt plus plan, you're done. You're cooked! Even if you try to sit there, and try to come up with an answer yourself, your bro would come from the back and say something like, ""bro, what r u wasting all this time for, just use photomath or gauth."" You be feeling like a loser when you try to lock in. I don't even have to tell you why learning and teaching yourself a difficult concept is better than using ai apps. Unless your pulling out your phone in exams, your're the one that's going to get cooked.

Imma cut the bs, here is wht I made, a website, that explains you difficult concepts, heck your entire powerpoint, pdf, slide, only in a few minutes. It LITERALLY talks to you, explains to you in the most simple and straightforward way.

1h2a1w5,1,2024-11-28,Medical School vs Masters in Computer Science,u/Ad-Leading2901,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/1h2a1w5/medical_school_vs_masters_in_computer_science/,"I am currently a first year medical student at a US MD school. While I enjoy studying medicine, it's hard to ignore the negatives many echo about the field, and I feel constantly dissuaded by the emphasis on rote memorization vs novel problem solving. I believe anyone studying medicine to truly make valuable contributions to people's quality of life would quickly realize that their time, effort, and knowledge is better spent on developing new ideas, rather than memorizing diagnoses that anyone could find just as easily on ChatGPT. For example, it seems that true demand in healthcare should be in creating new kinds of computational tools that would likely help more people, more effectively than any individual doctor could. It is already the case that AI is capable of making more accurate diagnoses in many scenarios than most doctors. Would it not be the case that improving this technology could provide better medical care that is accessible by even more people? If it is, then how would anyone with both the ability to become a truly effective doctor and desire to make a positive impact not quickly come to the same conclusion?

Instead of embracing these new possibilities, the field of medicine seems to stand opposed to any change or dissenting thought. In some ways, it makes sense why, as the value of the degree is mainly derived from the assurance, trust, and stability it provides. This emphasis of stability, however, comes at a cost. Instead of solving the deeper root cause of a problem, healthcare seems to focus on short term, bandaid solutions to solve a patient's most immediate symptoms. While I don't think that this must be inherent to the idea of medicine as a field, I do believe it is a reflection of the way the system of healthcare is currently administered. Though it makes sense, as in any non-competitive system where new ideas are repressed, that it will inevitably continue in that direction through a negative feedback loop. This method of ""indoctrination"" through memorization may have been effective before Google, or even before ChatGPT, but now that it's clear AI is at least theoretically capable of solving clinical cases than even the best doctors, it doesn't seem to make sense why medical education remains practically unchanged from how it was 20-40 years ago. If AI could effectively complete all cognitive tasks relating to medicine, then how much value could doctors truly provide compared any other mid-level providers?

I have the option of beginning a masters in computer science at a top 5 program now, or continuing medical school and pursing it afterwards. I already have a bachelors in CS, and I do have a passion for the field mainly due to how I see its potential applications. However, I am also interested in medicine, just in a different way than that is common. The stability of a medical degree vs uncertainty of the CS job market does play a role. Additionally, the opportunities provided by an MD are seemingly greater than a masters. While it seems most people would choose medical school, perhaps due to its salary potential and certainty, it does seem as though the grass is often greener on the other side. I would like to hear anyone else's perspectives on this situation concerning both the field of medicine or computer science.",User_deleted,0

A well-crafted prompt can generate insightful responses, while a poorly worded one can lead to irrelevant or nonsensical outputs. Here are some tips to help you write effective AI prompts:  
  
Be Specific and Clear:

* Avoid vague prompts: Instead of ""Write an essay,"" try ""Write a 500-word essay arguing for or against the use of AI in education, focusing on its impact on creativity and critical thinking."" 
* Provide context: Give the AI background information or specific guidelines related to your IGCSE syllabus.

Use Keywords and Phrases:

* Identify key concepts: Highlight the main points you want the AI to focus on, such as specific IGCSE topics like ""photosynthesis"" or ""Newton's laws of motion."" 
* Use specific language: The more precise your language, the better the response.

Experiment with Different Prompts:

* Iterate and refine: Don't be afraid to try different approaches.
* Learn from mistakes: Analyze the AI's responses to identify areas for improvement.

Tools like OctiLearn's AI Tutor, Octavia, are specifically designed and trained on the IGCSE syllabus. This means that Octavia can provide tailored assistance for IGCSE students, from explaining complex concepts to generating study materials aligned with the specific requirements of the curriculum. By utilizing AI, IGCSE students can enhance their learning, improve their grades, and gain a deeper understanding of their subjects.",active,2

I worked for a few months as a Java Developer before switching to cloud, where my tech stack is AWS, Terraform, and basic Bash/Unix skills. On my last project, I worked on modifying/creating Terraform modules, which was pretty straightforward and enjoyable. Unfortunately, that project ended, and I’ve been thrown into a new one that’s way harder.

I joined mid-project, so it’s hard to understand the context. They use technologies I’m completely new to (Azure DevOps, GCP, and some complex Unix setups). I’ve been here about two weeks, and I feel overwhelmed. Every task requires multiple technologies, and I often need a call or two with someone to even understand what’s being asked. Even after that, I frequently need to ask for step-by-step guidance, which makes me feel like I’m bothering them a lot. Tasks that could take others an hour take me 1–2 days.

Right now, my process is to break down tasks into steps and write down questions, but I still miss things. I use chatgpt and ofc google a lot (without sharing confidential info), but it doesn't help a lot. I’m also the only one from my company on this project, so I can’t rely on them for support. I also can't learn much about this outside work hours since I have lots of stuff at my uni and try to have some social life.

1h2ynmb,2,2024-11-29,Insights into the potential future of knowledge acquisition. ,u/JayTheTortoise,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1h2ynmb/insights_into_the_potential_future_of_knowledge/,"I wanted to speak to a few things in higher education I don't see spoken to that often, probably because both parties (the teaching and the taught) are afraid of the reality of the situation. 

I'm a master's student in the area of policy writing for transnational organizations and governments. I use 4o to do a number of things, mainly assisting in formatting or helping with tedious non-essential skills related to producing researched writing. I am very opinionated and I never want ChatGPT to speak for me, it doesn't actually do me any favors in that regard, even if I could go undetected. I actually care about my perspective and how I get that across through spending time synthesizing information through my own lens, something AI can't ever fully comprehend because it doesn't have a comprehensive history of all my thinking and experience no matter how much I feed it my contemporary opinions. i.e., remembering a 30min long story of something that happened 8 years ago that may inform one particular sentence or, more importantly, all of my experiences related to my accumulative knowledge that can't be readily input or made to make sense to an AI. 

At the same time, I am not naive to it's capabilities. Often I see people downplay it's capabilities simply because they take the manufacturing of writing at face value. Such as simple inputs and outputs. However, I've experiemented extensively with ""training"" Chatgpt in a number of ways and have produced mindblowing results in it's ability to produce extrodinary writing. This is accomplished by a number of methods: 1.) Having access to researching platforms allows you to feed it pdfs and txt files of scholarly work and studies. You can assist this process by incorporating Adobe and Microsoft software to help with compressing and/or extracting text. 2.) Next you carefully and incrementally move through the documents in sections and prompt it accordingly. Mutli-attempt summarizing, theoretical frameworks overlayed, drawing contrasts and similarities between documents, etc. 3.) You then make it meta by condensing large amounts of insights you think are applicable into additional documents that you funnel back into the conversation so it can process more efficiently in longer conversations, as well as understanding ""what you're after"" more and more. 4.) When this is more or less complete, you can begin to expand your data to include other data sets, whether they are indirect or directly related to the data. i.e. combining these ""master documents"" with other ""master documents"" on adjacent subjects as to flesh out larger and larger perspectives in a given field or area of interest. This can alter early insights, and you can go back and adjust accordingly by editing what you think is best. 5.) A critical aspect of how these large sets of information translate into something more meaningful is by also training the AI to learn the unique and specific writing styles of other key authors or scholars by using their own words as input, i.e. incrementally inputing entire chapters or entire books of authors and burrowing into the structure and tone of their writing styles. By doing this, you can either emulate, simulate, or shape your master documents according to the *syntax* of authors you find applicable or competent to speak on your information. 6.) This can also become meta by comparing and contrasting various syntaxes. This is not so much about obfuscating the voicing of your original syntax as it is combatting the blind spots and biases within a particular author's writing style, i.e. combining what you like about the structure of certain authors and abandoning their respective ineffencies. 7.) After this is complete, you can more fully interject *your* perspective into the writing. In this sense, the accumulated data isn't ""the truth"", it's the sumation of ""all of the figures and all of the information sitting at the table"" and now you get a seat in which you can make your own conclusions, whether on substance or syntax or both. Finally on this point, this is happening in both directions in academia from my experience. Professors are synthesizing their students' work and restructuring their classes accordingly. I know in at least two instances professors graded papers of mine using AI software of some kind. Their feedback comments on my paper being a monologue produced by Chatgpt, I later confirmed when I sent my paper through it, prompting it with the same guidelines my professor was looking for. I got 100%. 

Also to consider, by observing this process firsthand, it has improved my comprehension of knowledge immensely. Going through the process itself requires heavy participation, to the point of ingraining knowledge as an act of studying. I do it for pleasure all the time, often printing out these finalized documents and cataloguing them for my own personal library. I think it can be thought of as a direct analogy to the arrival of computing in relation to the study of mathematics. The overvaluing of the tediousness of mathematical problem solving after the age of computing is completely abandoned today, because it has opened up new levels and dimensions of understanding that were previously limited by human lifespans. I believe the synthesis of *all* knowledge is headed in this direction. As I mentioned, this doesn't imply the ""truth"" of all things, it implies that the greater synthesis of knowledge and perspectives can effectively revolutionize the aquisition of knowledge and thereby open higher levels of understanding and insights. To be fair, the drawbacks of this are also alarming. Biases, overvaluing majoritarian perspectives, moralist and ethical dilemmas when considering every possibility on a given topic when it was previously gatekept by precise inputs, etc. As well as the problamatic implications of immense information being lost on those incapable or uninterested in comprehending it, further pushing the societal correlations that extend from academic inequalities, i.e. average people can fully participate and make rational choices using a calculator without considering higher mathematics, whereas these other subjects require comprehension beyond simple consideration to inform rational choices. For example, what we already see with climate science failing to translate into societal organization or restructuring. This transition will not be readily accepted or trusted by many people.

To put an optimistic spin on it however, I believe that these ""master documents"" will still be numerous and require extensive study in the way we currently look at the average scholarly article. Also, the idea that no one will need knowledge aquisition i.e. the equivalent of "" I don't need to know it, I'll just google it"" isn't as applicable because simple inquiries will be confronted by copious amounts of information that cannot be readily understood. I also believe that education won't be ""dead"", it will simply reinvent itself to where educators are arbiters of a more nuanced and complex web of information and perspectives. So their abilities will be reevaulated in terms of personable skills like the translating of information, communication, and getting students to develop points of view/critical analysis rather memorization.

1h3hcry,356,2024-11-30,Making students hand write their essays,u/Smooth_Classroom6683,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1h3hcry/making_students_hand_write_their_essays/,"I teach 12th grade humanities, and in my classes, students do a fair amount of writing. Our school does not issue Chromebooks; students bring their own laptops to class, which as you can guess raises all kinds of frustrating issues: texting, scrolling the internet, online gambling, TikTok galore, ChatGPT usage, etc. Every time I've talked to my admin about this, and stressed how much of a problem it is, I'm told it's my job as the teacher to monitor their computer usage as best as I can. (Lol, yeah, OK.) 

I've decided that moving forward I'm going to require students to handwrite as much of their work as possible. The problem: so much of their handwriting is atrocious. Some of this is due to dysgraphia, which allows for accommodations, but for many of them, they just don't want to pick up a pencil and write. They rush through, don't take it seriously, don't think it's ""real"" work if it's not on a screen. 

Nevertheless, I would like to have their semester exams be entirely handwritten. I'd also like to spend some time in the weeks before having them practice writing out longer answers on paper. I want to even start grading them on their penmanship - mostly to get them to slow down, take their time, not rush, and practice organizing their thoughts on paper. (Again, in cases of dysgraphia, I will of course provide accommodations - though the sad reality is that the students who will need these are some of the worst offenders when it comes to ChatGPT and distractions. Sigh...) 

In my estimation, going back to hand-written work is the only way to ensure they aren't being distracted by dopamine hits or using ChatGPT to write their answers (which is an insane problem at my school that no one at the top seems interested in addressing.) I literally cannot spy on the computer screens of 15+ students at once. And until we get our own Chromebooks, where we can block certain websites, or simply turn off internet capacity, these behaviors will never change. 

What do y'all think: is this a hill worth dying on? Or am I setting myself up for impossible frustration? Am I better off just washing my hands of this issue and accepting the fact that I cannot control what they do on their own computers? That until my admin wakes up and realizes the problem they're creating, students will just continue to do what they do? 

Bigger picture, I'm at the point this year where I have to decide what's worth swimming upstream for, and what's not. At the end of the day, my conscience feels rotten allowing students to get away with things I know will hurt them in the future, but I also have to acknowledge when it's just not within my control.
