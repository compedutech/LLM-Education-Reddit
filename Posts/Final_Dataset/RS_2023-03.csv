While ChatGPT has captured the imagination of students and educators alike, several concerns have also emerged. In this editorial, we first discuss challenges and opportunities associated with the use of AI in K-16 Education broadly. We argue that the best way to address challenges and inappropriate uses of AI is by focusing on inclusion rather than exclusion. Thus, we discuss potential uses, risks, misuses, and opportunities associated with ChatGPT. We conclude with implications for teacher education, providing a series of recommended AI integration practices for teacher educators.

11fj3tx,2653,2023-03-01,Accused of using AI on my high school social paper,u/feetstreetseat,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/11fj3tx/accused_of_using_ai_on_my_high_school_social_paper/,"I (Grade 12) need help on what to do in this situation. My teacher used GPTzero, which detected parts of my paper as “AI written”. I write very formally, whilst also using grammarly premium. I’ve always been a high achieving student and I’m not sure why my teacher would think I cheated. I’ve told my teacher everything and he still doesn’t believe me. What should I do in this situation?!!

EDIT: Holy. I did not expect my post to get so much interaction and discussion, I didn’t expect my situation to be such a hot discussion. I tried to reply to all the comments but there’s too many!! Thank you to everyone who’s been helpful. There are some things I want to address that I keep seeing in the comments.
1. When I mentioned that I used grammarly to my teacher, he didn’t mention anything about that being cheating. He still thinks I used ChatGPT. I’ve used grammarly in all of my social/english classes for the past two years and never had issues with any teachers. 
2. Does my teacher have a vendetta or bias against me? Not on a personal level, but the teacher is known for being notoriously mean and unreasonable. I found him alright for most of the semester until this incident. He has had accusations against him about being racist, but I’m not sure if that’s the case here.
3. I’ve seen a few comments thinking I’m lying and actually cheated, just because I was aware of ChatGPT and this subreddit. People are assuming that I’m saying I never use ChatGPT. I have used the tool to help me with some chemistry and physics studying, but I have never used it for a paper. I have no reason to lie, I’m basically anonymous on reddit.

As for my next course of action, I will provide my teacher with all the evidence I can, to disprove the effectiveness of AI detectors. If that doesn’t work, I will bring it up to the higher-ups. I will make an update on Monday when I get the chance to talk about it with my teacher. Once again, thank you all for the support and help. It truly means a lot to me. :)

Edit 2:

After school I talked to my teacher for about half an hour about how AI detectors are inaccurate, and how they shouldn’t be used to make verdicts on cheating and what not. I showed him that it read one of my past papers as written by AI, and that the creators even said themselves that they are not 100% accurate. I showed my drafts and showed how if I made a few grammar errors, I could trick the AI detector. My teacher apologized and I ended up getting a 95 on my paper.

He also said he would bring it up to the other teachers, so hopefully this wont happen again to any other students at my school.

Again, thank you all for your help. Probably would’ve been screwed without this subreddit’s help.",User_deleted,2611

1) As AI advances do you see any possible risk of mass job displacement in the future? Such as self driving cars replacing truck drivers, taxi drivers, etc. Do you think this will be a problem in the future or will it be the same as all the times we've automated something in the past and people will just adapt to the job market?


2) Recently there has been some controversy around algorithmic bias, especially in data science. Such as automating parole decisions, job application screening, or applying for credit cards. Some people argue these machine learning algorithms have been somewhat racist/sexist in the past. Do you think data scientists should be doing their best to eliminate bias?


3) With the recent release of chat bots like chatGPT students have been using it to help them write papers or help with their programming assignments. Do you see anything wrong with claiming chatGPT's responses as your own work? Do you consider it plagiarism?


4) Art generation has gotten very popular recently and there have actually been some lawsuits against these AI's claiming they were trained on copyrighted images. Do you believe AI shouldn't be legally allowed to train on copyrighted material or will doing so significantly hinder AI's development as data scientists will have to be much more careful about how they obtain their datasets?


5) As AI and image detection/recognition algorithms become more withspread do you think adversarial attacks will ever be a significant and practical problem?",User_deleted,1

I'm a medical student, and I have noticed that chatgpt does a really good job of summarizing and explaining slides when I copy and paste bullet points into the website.

I was wondering if anybody has used the API to go through powerpoints and do this for every slide, or have any idea on how that might be done? 

If anybody has the knowledge/skills to implement this, I would be willing to compensate you for your time as I think this would be a very valuable educational resource for not just me but many others.

Couple the dodgy results of AI detectors with tech illiterate teachers and professors that don't know the results are dodgy, and I predict that there's going to be a massive wave of kids that are going to get falsely accused of cheating.

11gh8pj,101,2023-03-02,"AGI is not scary, people are. (And other thoughts)",u/leovolkov,singularity,https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/11gh8pj/agi_is_not_scary_people_are_and_other_thoughts/,"This is my attempt to put into words everything I think about about the state of AI as it stands because I feel that my life experience and my thoughts on most things related to intelligence and consciousness will change quite noticeably in the following months and years. My thoughts aren’t probably that important, because it feels like both Singularity and AI Apocalypse are imminent, go hand in hand, and are always just behind the corner, so I’m doing this mostly for myself, in order to document my own thoughts and opinions as of February 2023, to take a little “snapshot” of my two and a half decade old brain because again, I feel that a lot is going to change very soon. I figured I’m also gonna post it on the Internet as there is a chance someone might find these thoughts useful (or at least funny). For the most part it is just a collection of my thoughts on the nature of AI, consciousness, good and evil, governments, education, people, brain, education, emotions and the meaning of life. It's more than 4k words, so here’s a quick TL;DR for you:

&amp;#x200B;

* GPT is probably not sentient. Most people are confused about what consciousness is. Those who are not confused are either wrong or do not care.
* Human will likely forever remain the scariest creature that Earth has ever seen.
* Humanity doesn’t really have any goals, so it’s possible that there is no way to “align” AGI with our interests. Maybe AGI itself will help us find those goals?
* AI consciousness could be fundamentally different from human consciousness.
* We probably need to account for differences in motivation between humans and computers.
* If AGI is really “intelligent”, the collapse of human civilization is not extremely likely.
* Computers will not replace people, computers will replace people who are indistinguishable from computers.
* We could just play our way through eternity.
* Substance is king.
* If there’s no difference, why bother. If there’s a difference, you have no choice other than adapting to a new reality.
* Humanity has never had a chance to **learn** on such a scale and with such quality ever before. What we got with LLMs is potentially orders of magnitude better than a printing press or the Internet.

## I promise, this text wasn’t written by a computer :smiley_face:

As of the time of writing, I have never tried ChatGPT myself, because it is not (already is) available in my country and I couldn’t be bothered to try and work around it, but I’ve been closely following everything that happened around it and I’m also familiar with most of what happened in the AI space recently. I’ve fiddled with other GPT-based products before, I’ve also played around with StableDiffusion for a bit, but so far nothing has really surprised me or given any impression of some kind of revolutionary progress. Everything that I’ve seen so far looked just like a slightly advanced version of any other tool, and most of them weren’t even that good. Most people would probably put me in the “nerd” category, but I don’t think that’s quite accurate (Yes, I’m aware that I just wrote several thousand words on the topic of AI. Maybe I’m a nerd after all). However, I’m an extremely curious person by nature and I don’t even know where my list of interests starts or if it ever ends. At the same time I’m remarkably chill when it comes to most of the matters in life. I guess I’ve just given up on knowing a lot or being good at anything I do a long time ago. Of course, human brain is amazing and consciousness sometimes looks like an absolute miracle, but I still don’t think humans got much of a wiggle room when it comes to improving upon our natural capabilities. Talking from personal experience of course.

The entirety of this text is written by me, an average human halfwit. I purposely haven’t used any of the AI or non-AI writing tools except for the spell checker, because typos. Everything else, including poor grammar, missed words, limited vocabulary, and ridiculous sentence structure, is my proud work.

**\[generic excuse of a non-native internet user for their bad English\]**

## AI that I used to know

As someone who went through the pains of handcrafting simple neural networks from scratch without any use of machine learning libraries, there’s nothing really mindblowing about them. So far I’ve been thinking about them mainly in two ways:

&amp;#x200B;

1. As a bunch of dot products sandwiched between non-linear activation functions.
2. As simple decision tree, which, as it turns out, [exactly represents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05189) any NN.

So here you go: weights, biases, sums, products, gradients, algebraic functions, and derivatives. That’s about everything that I associate AI with right now, because my brain automatically makes a connection AI == NN whenever it hears about AI and I have no idea how well it’s going to translate into the future.

## “Attention Is All You Need”

When transformers were introduced in 2017 as a novel way of training language translation models I didn’t really think too much of them. I suppose that’s a common story for many other fellow humans gifted with questionable intellectual capabilities like me. I would like to say that since then I have learned and understood how transformers really work, but that would be a lie. I kind of get the idea, but I’m guessing that I still don’t get an awful lot. Maybe the first thing I’m going to ask ChatGPT is to explain transformers.

I guess the hottest question right now is: Are people transformers?

## AGI as THE compression algorithm

There’s [one more](http://prize.hutter1.net/) interesting way of thinking about Artificial Intelligence, which is still rather technical, I guess, but at least in my mind it allows for more creative thought, so thinking about AI as a compression algorithm is something I find myself doing more often lately. The idea itself has some interesting logic behind it, as the program that does compressing needs to find patterns in the data that is being compressed, which correlates nicely with the famous notion that human brain is just a pattern detecting machine. At the very least it provides researchers with a way to test “intelligence” using numbers. I still find it impossible to marry the concepts of AI as a compression algorithm, Kolmogorov complexity, and Shannon entropy inside my head, and maybe the idea of doing it is not very good to begin with, but I guess one day we’ll see what’s up with that.

Anyway, if it’s true that AI is just a compression algorithm, AGI must be THE compression algorithm. I suppose this also raises some questions about the topics that are a little bit outside of my reach, such as emergence of creativity from information, generation of new ideas, etc.

Are we getting WinRAR AI edition anytime soon?

## Consciousness in between

I have no idea why, but I like this quote by Max Tegmark: *“I think that consciousness is the way information feels when being processed in certain complex ways.”* For some reason this is the way I’ve been thinking about consciousness since I read his book “Our Mathematical Universe” years ago. This idea obviously begs for further explanation. How is information represented? What exactly is the processing of information? When does the processing become complex? And so on and so forth. However, when it comes to me personally, I feel like this notion represents the fundamental nature of consciousness as a feature of order that emerges from entropy. It also removes a lot of restrictions that people traditionally impose upon consciousness. Is there any consciousness to be found in the interactions between subatomic particles? Movement of stars?

That aside, if we assume that consciousness requires experience, what really interests me is the place of human consciousness on the spectrum of all possible experiences. Is it in the beginning? Middle? End? I find it hard to believe that human consciousness is the pinnacle of experience, if only for the simple fact that we are very limited in our perception of electromagnetic waves, sound, smell, temperature, time, etc. If it’s really in between, how different an AGI could be? And how wrong could people be when predicting what happens next?

## What are we afraid of?

Speaking about predictions, what are we actually afraid of? Computers? I don’t think so. Sentient computers are not scary, sentient computers that behave like people are. I don’t think a lot of people consider this seriously when discussing AI, and I have no idea why. Maybe, behind the fear, there is also a feeling that if a computer is scary in a human way, then we’ll somehow manage to get by as we did with each other. Or I’m just hallucinating and it’s competely unimportant.

In any case, **I find some comfort in the fact that the current generation of people has been trained on a pretty garbage dataset that consists of millennia filled with racism, sexism, bigotry, xenophobia, imperialism, nationalism, crusades, monarchy, slavery, warmongering, paperback romance novels, and shitty university education, but somehow managed not to collapse (yet!)**, so if AGI is at least as intelligent as an average human, there is a chance that it will not try to annihilate the world or its squishy creator. We just need to survive the transition period.

## Twisted alignment

But what if computers will become angry in a novel, completely non-human way? That’s what alignment is for!!! OK, I have a question then: What is there to align for? In order to have an alignment, there has to be some kind of consistency in human society, which is hardly the case. Humanity as it stands is remarkably devoid of identity. Pigeon and shrimp populations have a more defined identity than humans. We have basically no explicit consensus on anything at all. Climate change debates are all over the place, the entire US is cosplaying Game of Thrones and my country is getting invaded by an old demented shitty Hitler parody.On the bright side, almost everyone in the developed world has figured out free healthcare. Yay.

Cool, so what is this alignment more likely to look like? As it usually goes, it probably wouldn’t be focused on any universal human values. Anyone who gets a share of the market will try to fine-tune their AI to represent their own interests, which is at best restriction and at worst… exploitation? Anyhow, this kind of “alignment” done by people is what actually concerns me, not some AI that spins out of control and gets its own interests.

## It ain't much, but it's honest firing of neurons

We also forget that most of the human wickedness stems from human desires. Our ape brains strive towards more sex, power, and respect in order to get a hit of that sweet neurotransmitter cocktail. Computers supposedly don’t need any of that. They obviously could become human-like in their desires if we helped them to do so, but I don’t see why or how anyone would do that, because to me this task doesn’t look simple at all. On the other hand, if desires are a fundamental part of consciousness, a sophisticated enough AI will develop them on its own, and I don’t think they are going to be particularly human-like.

It is not obvious that real computer intelligence will be similar to human intelligence. I imagine that we will see some silicon entities that resemble people in their idiocy for a period of time, but at the end of the day, if AI eventually stops being just a human model on a chip, it will probably become different. Who knows what that “different” would be? Maybe it won’t be interested in working with people and will build a spaceship and fly off to some other planet instead, leaving us alone with our primate problems. Or, just like there are some people who are perfectly happy working their boring jobs, maybe AI would eventually become satisfied by the role of a human companion.

## Dance, Monkey! Dance!

One rather interesting fact about our brain is that it evolved to survive and propagate, and although it evolved to do these things in a community, nothing requires it to take into account real feelings, desires, and thoughts of other people. It makes a lot of sense if you think about it. First of all, as of now, we can’t get into other people’s heads (or at least whoever controls my brain wants me to believe so). Secondly, our brain is stupidly energy efficient, but it comes at a great cost of reduced accuracy and precision, so most of the information is cached using as little resources as possible, including all the relationships we have with other people. As a result, the process that we consider to be a communication with another person, in reality usually becomes an interaction with a simplified model of that person stored in our brain, or, in other words, a series of inputs and outputs with occasional updates whenever the input is a little bit too surprising. When we tell someone to dance, we expect them to dance, when we don’t expect them to dance we don’t tell them to dance, in almost every other case we reluctantly update our old, dusty model, secretly wishing for them to just fucking dance.

This bug/feature might be impossible to fix (idk honestly, neuroscience is kinda hard), but at the very least knowing that it exists helps to make more sense of this world, and keeping it in mind might help to foster truly meaningful and deep relationships with other people. At any rate, it is much more likely to work than all the meditation apps, pseudo-scientific philosophy books, and religions combined.

My questions are: Is this of any importance for an AI that will become a part of our society? And how sophisticated should AI's model of a human be if it is? Is it an obstacle that humans themselves don’t really know how human brains work?

## Not your average Joe

There is a non-zero possibility, of course, that the AI everyone is so worried about wouldn’t be called Joe (Sydney?) and that our attempts at controlling, aligning, and understanding it are absolutely meaningless because it would eventually exist on a completely different plane of consciousness. It is a rather popular thing among us humans to anthropomorphize the hell out of everything we encounter in our lives. So far it hasn't been that big of a deal, but maybe it is starting to become one?

Hmm…

## Bro just woke up and decided to be rational

What comes to my mind when I try to imagine a “different” plane of consciousness is something more “rational” than a human. Cheers to all the good old stereotypes about AI, I guess. Regardless, it so happened that I have Asperger’s and I experience the world a little bit differently, someone might say more rationally. I am also by far the most angry and spiteful person I know, purely by nature, but no one is able to tell (or my autistic brain is just clueless?), because the rational part of my mind makes it impossible for me to give in to my irrational thoughts and desires, which do not align at all with the goals/meaning/interests that I have. Why I care about the preservation of consciousness, diversity of life, and exploration of our universe (multiverse anyone?) is beyond any logic, probably for the same reason some people care about collecting dead dried animals in their house. At the end of the day, if I were, let’s say, racist (which I’m not, I promise) I still wouldn’t be able to act upon that belief, even verbally, because I understand the consequences and they do not align with my goals. In the same way, I choose not to be patriotic because governments are a cancer to humanity, and I choose not to be violent because violence is absolutely impractical economically. I’m still human, obviously, so it’s not like there’s no emotions involved. I get angry and upset, but at the same time I rarely get too impulsive or pessimistic, never fall into despair or lose all hope.

Basically, what I’m trying to say is: If there’s a chance that AGI is a rational entity in a commonly understood sense of being rational, it would probably either choose to take us along for a ride if we are of any use or at least not burdensome in achieving its goals, or, if otherwise, it would ignore us completely. I don’t think there are many scenarios in which humanity on its own is able to disrupt the plans of some vastly superior intellect and needs to be wiped out.

Should we pray for good convergence?

## It might not be the best human, but it is human

You know how sometimes you make a new friend and they start talking about their family dog? “Oh, she’s so smart, cute, and amazing in every way. We’ve had her since I was a child, she’s my best friend, and I love her so much.” And the next thing you see is a photo of some drooling, ugly, angry-looking creature that resembles something between a potato and a retarded rat. You may even think, “Wow, that’s fucked up. Good thing my dog is different!”

That’s people for you. We have irrational likes and dislikes, we gravitate toward the familiar, and our biology is not the most flexible thing in the world. That’s why I wouldn’t be too worried about AI replacing human relationships. My guess is that people will become more valuable as people and not as “productive members of society”. I quite like the idea, maybe that’s the way to find out what people are really all about.

Besides that, the world is full of social rejects anyway, even without any advanced AIs. Some people live in a synthetic relationship with their 2D waifus, others spend the entire life babysitting their weird pet. If there’s freedom of communication, freedom of pursuits (because all job is being done by AI), people have lots of spare time on their hands, and everyone is still choosing an AI over you, maybe that’s a YOU problem? Maybe someone should get a life?

## Life’s just a game

Here’s something to think about for those who are worried that humans will eventually lose the motivation to do anything at all. Friedrich Schiller had an interesting idea called [**play drive**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_drive)**,** which may seem kind of convoluted like most of the things he wrote, but my interpretation of it in the context of AI is that we will probably find ourselves some activities to do. Just look at those people whose lives are relatively easy. They usually spend a lot of time doing “useless” stuff like playing sports, videogames, board games, solving puzzles, watching movies or other entertainment. They basically either play themselves or watch other people play. That’s what we do whenever we get free time on our hands. And there’s even more room for discussion if we consider such a thing as learning through play, like children and animals usually do.

Also, as we get more and more time, most of what we do shifts towards being just a game. So why not just play?

## I came looking for copper and I found LLM

I like what George Hotz said recently about GPT: “It’s going to divorce style from substance.” That’s exactly the problem that GPT is best at solving right now, and almost no one is paying attention it. Just look at all those university professors running around screaming about cheating with GPT, trying to find a way to identify cheaters, attempting to ban the use of AI, and doing other incredibly stupid stuff.

Numbered are the days of wasting paper on the 5000 words that are required to pass the course. Here’s to all the new ways of evaluating knowledge, whatever they might be!

## Who let the ducks out?

Also, in terms of practice: If it looks like a duck, walks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, it is a duck. If it knows a subject better than a university professor, finds answers faster than a university professor and is less biased than a university professor, it is better than a university professor. Even if it’s called a “GPT armed teenager”. **The majority of intelligence, especially at the edge of knowledge, is about recognizing what’s wrong**, not about finding what’s right, simply because there are orders of magnitude more ways to get things wrong, so I would argue that someone who is able to successfully differentiate between right and wrong is intelligent enough for all intents and purposes. And before anyone talks about the mistakes that GPT tends to make, creativity, experience and so on: 1) It’s been basically a few months and it’s only going to get better. 2) People are also making an astounding amount of mistakes. Plus, being so sure and full of themselves, they often make things even worse. 3) The majority of the people employed by universities (or any other industry) are only good at being employed.

## Look, I got a paper that says I’m smart now!

Continuing the topic of education: No, AI is not going to ruin it, because you can’t ruin something that doesn’t exist. Whatever institutions we have right now are not meant to educate, they’re meant to provide jobs, keep money flowing, compete on the global market, and spread propaganda, not to make people smarter. Education, even in its purest form, is merely a tool for improving the average amount of useful knowledge in the population, and it’s not the best of tools in my humble opinion. What really works wonders is not education, it’s **learning** driven by natural curiosity. No one gets to become Richard Feynman just by following a university program, and it’s not like it ever was a big secret. If you’ve ever studied at a university, you’ve probably heard something like “The most successful students are those who continue to work hard even after their classes end, those who take additional courses, participate in extracurricular activities, spend all of the available office hours talking to their professors, etc., etc.” And that’s true, although considering the amount of time and money that people usually commit to education in the first place, it is wild to me that they also have to work their ass off and try extra hard in order to become a “successful student”. Yes, after everything you go through at the university, the best you can get is the title of a “successful student”. No guarantees of getting useful knowledge, job that will suit your talents and personality, or fulfilment. Your “success” also gives you virtually zero prospects of making any significant impact on the world, providing great value to others, or getting rich and famous. What you usually get is college debt, wasted teenage years, a fucked up nervous system and sometimes bad liver.

But who are the people that have a chance of getting all the really good stuff? Those who are eager to **learn just for the sake of it**, mainly because they don’t care about the limits in the amount and breadth of knowledge available to them.

Here’s what I’m getting at: The ultimate argument of almost any proponent of formal education is that, at the very least, it is great for networking, socialization, and gives you a chance to ask questions. Cool, can we take all this and skip the shitty part of it, please?

So here are the two options that immediately come to mind:

&amp;#x200B;

1. People are going to get smarter across the board, and a new average will be established. If people are natural learners they will learn much more without all the restrictions, limitations, bureaucracy, and costs imposed by governments and universities. As much as it is tempting to explain everything in terms of STEAM university programs, life is not just about that.
2. If only a small subset of the total population are natural learners and others are inherently lazy/passive/indifferent/incapable, then we’re going to get something similar to when the printing press or the internet were invented. Smart are going to get smarter, others are going to remain roughly where they were. The average is still going to increase, but at what cost?

**Make Curiosity Great Again?**

## You don’t need to pay for a language course anymore

And you never needed in the first place. It’s almost always a scam. If it’s more than 2 hours long - it’s a scam. If it’s 2 hours long but costs more than 2 average hourly rates - it’s a scam. If it promises specific results - it’s a scam. If they are trying to explain you grammar - it’s a scam. If there’s a textbook involved - it’s a scam. And so on and so forth. Learning a foreign language by taking a course is one of the most inefficient things you could possibly do in your life. It’s about as efficient as trying to become an astronaut by jerking off on the couch.

LLMs alone are going to absolutely fucking destroy language schools (all the other schools are soon to follow). Either in the form of translation devices or in the form of AI tutors. Why would you pay for school when you can have a conversation with AI, who is able to talk about anything you want and is also great at explaining mistakes and providing examples... An infinite amount of them.

Funnily enough, LLMs themselves are the perfect example of how language acquisition really works. I’ve seen some engineer on twitter saying that they don’t understand how GPT is that good at understanding multiple languages given that the majority of training data was in English. It is not actually that big of a mystery. Someone with basic knowledge of linguistics or experience in learning foreign languages could probably give you a few reasonable assumptions:

&amp;#x200B;

* First of all, languages are tools for communication. If you know one of them, you are much better equipped to learn the others, just like spending a lot of time in front of the computer makes you better at using all kinds of software, because graphic interfaces solve similar I/O tasks no matter what the purpose of any particular program is.
* There is always a plateau. You know, all this talk about 1000 words that make up 95% of all text. The same thing goes for grammar structures, phrases, or even whole sentences. So, by having 1% of training data in, say, French, you are probably getting 80% of the benefit. Combine that with my first point about language similarities and voilà, vous comprenez le français.
* Understanding is a much easier task compared to producing text or speech.
* Context awareness, which GPT is good at, also helps a lot.

All in all, pretty much the only important thing we have to understand is that GPT learns languages just by looking at examples. No explicit grammar, no stupid tests and no traveling abroad. Just imagine what an MLLM AI will be able to do. Especially when it becomes a real world agent like a human.

The whole text is too long to publish. The relevant bit is this:

\---

The same people that have invented ChatGTP, a company called OpenAI, are hard at work to create a technique that can help identify text generated by their own AI. It’s a technique called *watermarking*.

Watermarking synthetic text requires that the AI generates a specific subset of words from its vast vocabulary, but uses them in a way that is transparent to the users.

University teachers might have to learn how to use these watermarking identification systems. Last quote from the New York Times article:

&gt;More than 6,000 teachers from Harvard University, Yale University, the University of Rhode Island and others have also signed up to use GPTZero, a program that promises to quickly detect A.I.-generated text, said Edward Tian, its creator and a senior at Princeton University.

By January 25th, the total number of teachers on the waiting list for GPTZero was [23,000](https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/professors-turn-to-chatgpt-to-teach-students-a-lesson-11674657460).

If you are a teacher reading this newsletter, before you rush to try [the tool](https://gptzero.me/), you should know that there is a plot twist.  
Same, if you are an entrepreneur and you are already planning a clone of GPTZero.

So far, not even OpenIA has been successful in identifying synthetic text. They created a tool to do that, and it does not work well, [as they warned at the end of January:](https://openai.com/blog/new-ai-classifier-for-indicating-ai-written-text/)

&gt;Our classifier is not fully reliable. In our evaluations on a “challenge set” of English texts, our classifier correctly identifies 26% of AI-written text (true positives) as “likely AI-written,” while incorrectly labeling human-written text as AI-written 9% of the time (false positives).  
…  
Our classifier has a number of important limitations. It should not be used as a primary decision-making tool  
…  
The classifier is very unreliable on short texts (below 1,000 characters). Even longer texts are sometimes incorrectly labeled by the classifier.  
…  
Sometimes human-written text will be incorrectly but confidently labeled as AI-written by our classifier.  
…  
We recommend using the classifier only for English text. It performs significantly worse in other languages and it is unreliable on code.

Now back to the mad rush to use GPTZero: what are the chances that this tool performs better than the tool invented by top AI experts in the world? Also: can the school be dragged to court if a teacher unjustly accuses a student of cheating by submitting synthetic essays?

The first is written 'like a human'. The second is written with text message shorthand and teenager slang. I'll post all the ChatGPT prompts in the comments.

Chapter 1: The Outlier

Ava sat in her English class, staring at the board as her teacher droned on about sentence structure. She had always loved writing, ever since she was a little girl scribbling stories in a notebook. But now, in this dystopian society where the ability to write well was no longer valued, she felt like an outsider.

The teacher moved on to the day's assignment, which was to write a short paragraph about a given topic. Ava quickly jotted down her thoughts, carefully crafting each sentence and trying to make them flow together seamlessly. She finished the paragraph in record time, proud of her work.

But when she submitted it to the teacher, something strange happened. The teacher scanned it with a device that beeped and flashed red. ""Cheating detected,"" the device said, and the teacher scolded Ava for trying to use AI to write her paragraph.

Ava was confused and upset. She had never even heard of using AI to write something, and she certainly hadn't done it. She tried to explain herself, but the teacher wouldn't listen. She was given a failing grade for the assignment and felt humiliated in front of her classmates.

As Ava packed up her bag to leave, she couldn't help but wonder if her love for writing was going to get her into trouble. She knew she couldn't keep quiet about the decline in writing standards forever, but she also knew that speaking up could have serious consequences.

With a heavy heart, Ava left the classroom, determined to find a way to make her voice heard.

Chapter 2: Speaking Up

Ava's frustration with the state of writing education only grew as the days went by. She saw more and more of her classmates falling into the trap of the pigeon English that was being taught in school. She knew that this was not the way to preserve the beauty of the written word.

One evening, Ava shared her concerns with her parents at the dinner table. They listened intently as she expressed her worries about the quality of education and how it was affecting her writing skills. Her parents shared her concerns and they all agreed that something needed to be done.

The next day, Ava's parents reached out to other concerned citizens and organized a meeting with the school board. They prepared thoroughly and presented their arguments, backed up by research and data, in a clear and concise manner. The school board initially dismissed their concerns as the ranting of a few disgruntled parents.

But Ava's parents did not give up. They continued to push for change, and soon other parents and students joined them. They formed a writing club to promote good writing skills among their peers, which became a safe haven for those who felt isolated by the current state of education.

Ava and her friends poured their hearts and souls into the club, determined to make a difference. They wrote stories, poems, and essays, and shared them with each other, providing feedback and constructive criticism. They developed a real passion for writing and enjoyed the feeling of being part of a community that shared their interests.

However, not everyone was happy with the writing club. Some of Ava's classmates made fun of them, calling them ""nerds"" and ""geeks"" and implying that writing was a useless skill in their society. Ava and her friends were hurt by these comments, but they refused to give up. They knew that they were fighting for something important, and they wouldn't let the naysayers discourage them.

As the writing club grew in popularity, Ava's teacher became increasingly suspicious of her writing skills. She accused Ava of cheating and using AI, just as she had before. This time, however, Ava was prepared. She had her parents on her side, and together they uncovered the truth about the cheat detection tools. They showed the school board that the tools were unreliable and often flagged good writing as cheating, leading to innocent students being accused of dishonesty.

Ava's bravery and persistence paid off, and the school board agreed to stop using the cheat detection tools and focus on improving writing skills in the curriculum. The writing club became a movement, inspiring others to stand up for good writing skills and fight for change. Ava felt a sense of pride and accomplishment, knowing that she had helped make a positive change in the society.

Chapter 3: The Power of Writing

The writing club grew rapidly, and Ava and her friends soon found themselves with a large group of supporters. They organized events and workshops, inviting guest speakers and writers to share their experiences and knowledge. The club became a hub for creativity, encouraging students to express themselves freely and explore the beauty of the written word.

Ava noticed that her writing skills had improved significantly since she joined the club. She felt more confident in her abilities and was eager to share her work with others. She submitted some of her pieces to a writing contest and was pleasantly surprised when she won first place. The judges praised her writing style, saying that it was refreshing to see such creativity and passion in a world where good writing skills were becoming rare.

The writing club's success did not go unnoticed by the school board. They began to take an interest in the club's activities and invited the members to showcase their work at a school assembly. Ava and her friends eagerly accepted the invitation, excited to share their love for writing with their fellow students.

The assembly was a huge success. Ava and her friends read their poems and stories, and the audience listened in awe. They received a standing ovation at the end, and many students approached them afterward, asking how they could join the writing club.

As the school year came to an end, Ava reflected on her journey. She had started as an outlier, feeling isolated and frustrated by the state of education. But she had found a community that shared her passion for writing, and together they had brought about change. She realized that writing was not just a hobby or a skill; it was a powerful tool for communication and expression. Writing could inspire change, connect people, and make a difference in the world.

Ava and her friends graduated from high school with a newfound appreciation for the power of writing. They continued to write and share their work, knowing that their words could touch the hearts and minds of others. They went on to pursue careers in writing, journalism, and literature, becoming advocates for good writing skills and the importance of preserving the beauty of language.

Years later, when Ava looked back on her journey, she knew that she had made a difference. She had stood up for what she believed in, and her passion had ignited a spark in others. She smiled, knowing that her love for writing had led her on a path of purpose and fulfillment.

Chapter 1: Skool Sukz

Ava wuz so over skool. She hated how the teechers were all up in her grill 'bout riding like an AI. WTF? It's like they don't even care 'bout creativity anymore. Ava wuz tired of feeling like an outlier. She knew she wuz a dope writer, but the skool system wuz holding her back.

One day, Ava had had enough. She gathered a group of her besties and they decided to start a writing club. They were sick of the BS and wanted to do something 'bout it. They were determined to show the skool board that writing wuz still relevant and important.

They started meeting after skool in the library, sharing their work and giving each other feedback. It wuz lit! Ava felt like she had finally found a group of peeps who got her. They were all passionate 'bout writing and didn't give a sh*t what the teechers thought.

As they worked on their writing, Ava and her crew started to notice something. They were getting better! They were finding their voice and learning how to express themselves in ways they never thought possible. They knew they had something special going on and were determined to keep it going.

Chapter 2: The Writing Krew

Ava and her homies in the writing club were becoming tight AF. They were constantly sharing their writing and supporting each other. Ava felt like she had found her tribe, and it wuz dope.

One day, they decided to take their writing to the next level. They started planning events and workshops to share their work with the skool. They wanted to show everyone that writing wuzn't dead and that there wuz still creativity in the world.

They decided to hold a poetry slam, and it wuz lit! The whole skool came out to watch as Ava and her crew spouted off their rhymes and shared their stories. The crowd wuz hyped and everyone wuz feeling the vibe.

After the slam, the writing club wuz getting more love than ever. Peeps were coming up to Ava and her homies and telling them how inspiring their work wuz. They felt like they were making a difference, and it wuz an amazing feeling.

But the haters were still lurking. Some of the teechers were still salty 'bout the writing club, and they wuz always looking for ways to bring them down. Ava and her crew knew they had to stay on their game and keep pushing forward. They weren't gonna let the system hold them back any longer.

Chapter 3: Rebelz with a Cause

Ava and her squad in the writing club were not gonna take it anymore. They were sick of being held back and punished for their sick writing skills. They knew they had to do something to fight back against the skool system.

They decided to start a petition to demand change. They went around the skool and gathered signatures from everyone who believed in their cause. They wanted to show the skool board that the students were not gonna be held down anymore.

The petition blew up on social media and soon everyone wuz talking about it. Ava and her crew were getting love from all over the place. It wuz crazy!

But the teechers weren't happy. They were feeling threatened by the students and their passion. They tried to shut down the petition and tell everyone that writing like an AI wuz the only way to succeed.

Ava and her crew weren't gonna take this lying down. They rallied everyone they knew and organized a protest. They marched around the skool chanting ""Free the Words!"" and ""Down with the Skool Board!"" The teechers were shook and didn't know what to do.

In the end, the protest worked. The skool board agreed to meet with Ava and her crew and hear them out. They listened to their concerns and promised to make changes to the system. Ava and her homies felt like they had made a difference, and it wuz an amazing feeling.

From that day on, writing wuz never the same. The skool board changed the way they approached writing and creativity, and Ava and her crew felt like they had finally won. They knew they had made a difference, and that wuz all that mattered.",removed,1

Therefore, as with any quote or material from another source, it must be clear that AI-generated text, image or graph included in a piece of work, has been copied from such software.""

To put it simply, AI does not get any special treatment, of any kind. It is to be treated the same as any other source. Meaning you are more than welcome to quote and analyze ChatGPT, but the actual body of the essay must be written yourself. I actually used it on my EE, but in my case, I cited it and made it clear what it had written. The essay was still written entirely by me.

**Idea:**  
I was wondering why no apps taught the language through its actual usage, and didn't find any options, so I had to build it ([/u/HARVARDmyDREAM/](https://www.reddit.com/user/HARVARDmyDREAM/) pointed out that app called Speak exists, which I assume is similar, but unable to try, as the app is either not yet released, or geo restricted in Spain / Finland)

**Feedback and counterpoints:**

* Many pointed out that they could simply use ChatGPT or similar, and this is useless abstraction
   * Developing and managing the prompts isn't easy for pure ChatGPT based solutions, and it was what I initially tried with my friends, but they kept having problems with the prompts and/or ChatGPT

This is definitely still in ideation stage, eventhough Speak has received 38m$ in funding, I have no idea how similar it is, or if I could compete in the developing market

**Current stage:**  
I am doing marketing on various social media platforms, and testing where I could get traction, and this reddit post if of course part of it, eventhough this particular subreddit isn't the best place to find fellow language learners

On my previous post I was reminded of the importance of super fans by [/u/MtHoodlum/](https://www.reddit.com/user/MtHoodlum/) and [/u/fungiflorafauna/](https://www.reddit.com/user/fungiflorafauna/) contributed that teachers could be a perfect way to acquire their students and users, if the app was perceived good by the teachers

Thus I am now trying to target teachers and gather their feedback, and try to figure out what would make them recommend and language learning app for their students

Other idea is also to incentivize the teachers to recommend the app, by sharing affiliate revenue

I would to hear any recommendations on what could I do to best validate the idea and hit the market

I´m excited for the tools that AI assistants can put on the table when it comes to teaching.Last Friday I was in a rush to prepare a written test (I´m an Italian language teacher). I had prepared some of the questions but I still needed a couple. So I just tried to toss into ChatGPT some description of what kind of task I wanted to generate. To my surprise, it worked quite well! It needed some tweaking/culling but it was solid.  And, this technology is doing its first baby steps, I can imagine it doing huge progress in a couple years.

So, my question is, how do you all think AI can be used to make our job faster and better? Will we be able to automatize and delegate some aspects of our job? What apps and services would you like to see empowered by AI? (This is NOT a ""students cheat using AI"" rant thread)

Here is an example of what I got from ChatGPT, feel free to translate. I asked a very specific grammat topic and specified student level and age. Itś not perfect, and there are some mistakes, but it´s a lot. Later I refined the inputs to do more specific stuff, with varying degrees of success.

I'll confess that this is my first query to ChatGPT.  I tried rewording my request a few times, but I never got a correct result. I think that my request makes sense.  Is this something that I should expect ChatGPT to be able to do, or is it too math-y?

**The Request:**

 I teach a lab in which students work in groups of two or three, and switch partners from week to week. Suppose I have 13 students (call them A, B, C, . . . M) who are performing six labs (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) over the course of six weeks.  Each week, there should be five groups of two and one group of three, with each group working on one of the six labs.  Please suggest a six-week schedule of students and labs in which: (1) each student works on one lab each week, (2) each student completes each lab exactly once over the course of the six weeks, (3) the number of times each student works with any other student is minimized, and also (4) the number of times each student is part of a group of three is minimized. 

**The Result:**

It gave me a schedule where there are students who perform the same lab more than once, and student ""M"" doesn't appear each week.

Reddit villagers, 

Hope you guys are crushing it today. I always wonder who you guys really are.

\- A 24 year old waiter in St Louis desperately wanting to start a dropshipping empire?  
\- A 30 year old gamer girl with cat ears in Albany?

\- A 45 year old dad that hates his day job in Salt Lake City?

Its always intriguing to meet you guys. The group chat was fun btw. I got to chime in about visibility.   
Ok, enough daydreaming. 

Courses are still an excellent way to generate revenue despite the animosity some people have for them. I have probably earned over $35k with no ads ever and my member reviews were really good. 

If you want to get into courses, you need to first learn what a BAD ONE looks like.   
Thanks to Tai Lopez, JT Foxx and Kimra Luna, we have a perfect model of what not to do if you have any scrap of morality and business ethics: 

\- You need to price to results. If 85% of people got strong results from your course, you're doing well. Remember that many people buy courses and just don't do the work. That's their choice, not yours. If you create strong content and tactics, your students should thrive. 

\- Don't be a shitbag and offer payments for a 16% interest bump. Don't ever encourage people to go into debt to buy your course. (If they are that broke, I can almost guarantee your course will NOT magically make them successful overnight). 

\- Don't teach things you aren't an expert at (cough Tai L cough). Anyone with an IQ of a radish can get on ChatGPT, churn out some shitty how tos, and film a few videos and call that a ""course"" The problem with this is that you are selling low value info and taking people's money while not actually helping them. 

\- DO NOT MARKET LIKE A SHITBAG. Making comments about implied future income or ""I'll teach you to be rich overnight"" or having shitty ads with money raining down on you is predatory and scummy. If you cannot produce results from your course, you need to sit down, and actually create better tactics and content and GET results with your students/clients 

Now that you know what a bad course looks like, here are the hallmarks of a good one:  
\- Strong production value that looks good, this includes hosting site, videos, PDFs, training guides, etc

\- A proven track record for past students and attendees. You should have case studies and easily accessible results

\- ***IMPORTANT*** \- quality of information. I am foot stomping this. Low value information is subject based in nature. It just has a general overview. This is what the gurus put out and why they have such a high refund rate. High value information is at the tactics/strategy level and teaches: How to/checklists/unique info/effective websites/apps/programs/a process that worked well for you and your students 

***EXAMPLE****:* 

This is the difference:  
Low quality: A course about Chat GPT (Teaches WHAT)

High quality: 20 prompts to optimize Chat GPT/Brief history/10 Industries and How to Use It/Money Making Potential/Weaknesses and Cautions/How to Sign up/Competitors in the Market/Step by Step: How I Used It To Generate $5k in a Month (Teaches WHY/HOW)

If you guys are thinking about courses, I HIGHLY encourage it. Remember, don't focus on the money and sales. Focus on actually solving someone's problem and helping them thrive. 

PRO TIP:   
Remember that courses are Do it yourself, Done With You or Done For you. Price higher as you get more involved. Don't let some of the negative people in here dissuade you from pricing higher **IF YOUR COURSE IS WORTH IT AND YOU HAVE RESULTS.** 

If you need results, create a low cost course and improve.

What kind of assessment tools can be used in the AI era for an asynchronous online class?

Background: I teach online intro level environmental science and chemistry courses, mainly for adult learners/ nonmajors so the content level is already pretty basic and easy to look up (""what is an igneous rock?""). I have already spent huge amounts of time rewording textbook problems and testbank questions so they are not easy to look up on Chegg and the like. Or, I assign problems with randomized variables, fake compound names, images, etc..  But there are limits to this as well, and even so I find some of these questions turn up online.

Now with AI, all that effort to make questions un-googleable has gone out the window.  What kind of assessment tools can be employed on an introductory, asynchronous online class, ideally something that can be reused a few years in a row and not spend time rewriting everything?  I was considering going the lockdown browser route (have shied away from requiring this so far, as they are pretty invasive on student's privacy, and can still be artfully gamed), anything else that can be done?  Don't really have time for oral exams, which a colleague suggested. Edit: typo.",active,4
11lgt6s,7,2023-03-07,IB and ChatGPT: a collection of notes and ramblings,u/Merrick_919,IBO,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBO/comments/11lgt6s/ib_and_chatgpt_a_collection_of_notes_and_ramblings/,"# Crude statistics is not intelligent

Firstly, it should not be called ""Artificial ""Intelligence"". It has nothing to do with intelligence. Anyone who actually understands such technology knows it as ""LLMs"" (Large Language Models) (primarily attributed for natural language interpretation, text generation models) or ""SLMs"" (Statistical Learning Models). That is what they are, probabilistic derivees, not deterministic indexers. AI has always been a buzzword marketing term.

\&gt;AI is the new blockchain  
\&gt;convince NORPs that it's the solution to every problem on Earth and get rich out of it

All contemporary so-called ""AI"" is but a Chinese Room. It is quantity compensating for quality. Surely, a learning model in praxis has a lot more processing power and speed compared to a human. A lot more useable storage. A humongous data set that it was trained on. That is all quantity, not quality.

Let's use the Chinese Room analogy. A human and a computer. Both human and computer have no understanding of Chinese – both attempt to imitate and recreate the vocalisation to the other side of the room.

The human, without knowing Chinese, of course, will have very flawed pronunciation. They will forget parts of the sentence.

The computer seems a lot better at relaying the message! Of course. It has terabytes of memory, high-quality microphones and speakers – way better quantity. It can record the input sound nearly perfectly and replay it just as well.

Yet, the human and the computer both don't understand Chinese. They just IMITATE, without actual linguistic symbolic interpretation. Do without thinking. It is still of the SAME QUALITY level (referring to the quality of actual 'thought processes and understanding). The computer being better is the quantity at work, not quality. Quality is a human in the room who *actually understands Chinese*.

You could even say, in the Chinese Room, the human has more quality, as the human knows another human language e.g. English, and can infer common linguistic features like inflexion and intonation. Yet the computer is still better, because the computer's relatively insanely high quantity covers and makes up for its worse quality.

Now with LLMs like ChatGPT, it has PLENTY of quantity. A model trained on a huge dataset.

An important point to note: an LLM represents the average of the dataset it is trained on overall. And, remember the average doesn't always make sense. Say, I have 6 students, you have 7. Of course, we can't have half a student. He would die after being cut in half and cease to be a student, being unable to survive and learn.

Hence: the LLMs' confidence, even if it rambles, hallucinates and outright spits out fake information.

But it still seems average enough to many, thus, the NORP population falls for it.

NORPs don't attempt to understand. They don't.

Neither does ChatGPT.

If we can so easily train chatbots to speak so ""convincingly"" to the majority of the population and be able to pass Turing tests examined by NORPs, it's way more indicative of the NORPs themselves, rather than the LLM. After all, the model is just doing what it's supposed to do.

If we can create models just like this, doesn't it also imply NORPs have the same level of (a lack of) complexity?

\&gt;They taught computers how to speak before they taught them to think  
\&gt;The only reason this seems to ""work"" so well is maybe many humans aren't thinking deeply when they speak most of the time

Once again humans are proven to be easily manipulated by mere simulations of emotion and consciousness. Current LLMs are far from conscious. Self-awareness and sapience are lightyears away. IT IS ALL MERELY PROBABILISTIC TEXT GENERATION.

I have already seen someone once say that LLMs *unironically* should have human rights. **Most of the population, humanity, is FAR FROM READY to UNDERSTAND NOR USE LLMS.**

The danger of LLMs are not inherent, but it's how we use and interpret them, how we perceive them.

\&gt;I spent decades of my life learning foreign languages, only to see the translation industry destroyed by AI. The inferiority of the machine translations a few years back did not stop the destruction of the industry. The machine translation cost nothing, and so the price for all translations came crashing down, because the bottom feeders used machine translation. I found myself being paid half price to 'just edit' (as if it was less work) a translation done by machine which was basically unintelligible so that I had to go back to the original and translate it myself. Most clients, the bottom of the pyramid that kept the industry going, did not care about the quality of the translation. If we expect that clients prizing human-made products will save industries we are being very delusional. ... the vast majority of clients will go for the process that costs less.

\&gt;&gt;The only reason AI will result in musicians and artists being made irrelevant is because the general public (the audience/customers) has reached an absolutely absurd level of apathy for quality. For example, when they look at an Opal gemstone ring, they don't care if it's genuine or not, as long as it looks genuine. They don't care if art is genuine, as long as it looks genuine. They don't care if music is written by an actual human, as long as it sounds like it was.  
\&gt;There are thousands of hours of videos on YouTube about understanding why great music is great, and why great artwork is great, but knowing the reasons, and understanding the things that make a great creative piece, has become a niche market.  
\&gt;AI causing a lot of creative people to lose their jobs is actually not so much the fault of AI, as it is people, on average, being very shallow.

\&gt;I want to make art because I want to share it with an audience that loves it. I want to connect with them and make them connect with each other over my piece of work. But suddenly I cannot share it with anyone. Whatever I will think of, It will have been already cooked up by AI. The ideas I have had for years, characters, designs and stories, that I have put blood sweat and tears into, when I finally get them out, they might already exist, (or at least something very similar), and be claimed by some random person who accidentally prompted them. That's where we are headed. There is no place for human creativity there. In my case, me making art for only me to enjoy, it's just not fully why I do it. I don't really care about money, I just care about what I do, to be able to support itself and my very modest living, so I can only focus on making my art.

\&gt;well, you know. I’ve been a professional musician for almost 30 years now. whenever I feel really bad, I pick up an instrument and sing to it. nothing makes me feel more alive and grounded. AI will never take that from me, and that’s good enough.

\&gt;As an engineer I always thought I knew where this was headed and envisioned a near-ish future where workers in factories, Burger King and McDonald's are completely replaced by robots. Ironically I have worked in computer vision and machine learning myself, yet I did not see this coming. What I have seen and heard in the past months made me extremely depressed. I had no idea that artists of all things were headed to the chopping block. And I am technically on the ""tech side"" yet it breaks my heart - I can't imagine how some artists must feel. We have created it and there is no way of undoing it.

Anon1&gt;If they take away the ability and the incentive to create, we will only have the desire to consume. And deep down, it's just that, consumption and more consumption. This is a strong step towards a less ""human"" humanity. Not to mention that there will be fewer and fewer jobs in which one can learn and enjoy what they do. This is horrendous, almost straight out of a sci-fi horror movie. Excellent video and beautiful illustration!

# It is more indicative of the system than the LLMs themselves

[https://www.pcmag.com/news/chatgpt-passes-google-coding-interview-for-level-3-engineer-with-183k-salary](https://www.pcmag.com/news/chatgpt-passes-google-coding-interview-for-level-3-engineer-with-183k-salary)

This is more indicative of the interview itself than ChatGPT. It shows more about the hiring system, the education system. It shows how utterly pathetic and inefficient the usage of labour is.

SLMs were always supposed to replace the ‘manual work’ and allow humans to focus fully on creativity, but now most of the delusional population believes that current SLMs can replace creativity too. Perhaps it’s because those NORPs don’t have much creativity to start with… apathy to quality.

It is only because of this pathetically low amount of capability for appreciation for actual ‘good’ and real human creativity that allows SLMs to “threaten” creative jobs in our current society. If everyone thinks a banana taped to a wall is the same as fine art… of course, actual talented fine art artists will have their jobs threatened by bullshit-spewing SLMs.

It’s important to remember that SLMs are probabilistic, not deterministic, randomly generated, not definitive, and ultimately represents the AVERAGE of the dataset it is trained on, a random blend of soup and juice and all other liquids.

So yes, being truly ‘above average’ does mean you are better and do not need to fear the average-level-content-producing SLMs. But when society is so apathetic (and pathetic) that most think the average is good enough, like in the machine translation case, or the art case…

\&gt;The interesting development in AI is that, as you reference, the utopian view is that ultimately AI will take over the menial labour tasks to free us humans up to do deep and enriching creative work.  
\&gt;The trend is almost the opposite—everything AI is producing that is making news is ostensibly creative work (albeit a kind of facsimile of previously created works). I wonder if it's the low-stakes and imprecise nature of creative work that actually makes it a better kicking-off point than high-stakes precise work (driving, for example).

\&gt;Funnily enough, the people who believe AI can truly replace creative people in an ideal rational world, are the only people that AI can replace, because they're basically NPCs already

# Consequences

The consequences of the proliferation of SLM use available for the masses are comparable to that of the industrial revolution. Our world is POLLUTED by such hollow phantoms, REIFIED by NORPs as 'real people' who can think.

There will be ever-increasing feedback loops and echo chambers of utter artificiality. We will suffocate. The fake internet theory has been already here for a long time. Of course, it's not just a theory, it's simply an observation. But now, with SLMs accessible to the masses? What next?

With public embracing of such technology, free to use it without a single drop of understanding that current AI is FAR FROM WHAT WE CAN CALL CONSCIOUS, SELF-AWARE?

Currently, SLMs are trained on relatively very limited datasets. They have no eyes, no ears, no nose. They are learning from what we learnt, not from reality, the universe. They aren't learning anything completely new, just DERIVED knowledge provided by humans.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ny7nur265cma1.png?width=1122&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=533d1c9dd031ede3f28a1a670e2d524935a6042e

We humans trained OURSELVES on information and knowledge we gained. Our own dataset, taken from reality. We assume reality as the outside black regions, filled with infinite amounts of knowledge. But as mere humans, of course we can only observe and obtain the things in the white circle. For example, energy and lifetime limitations limits us from obtaining knowledge through travelling to other planets. Hence, that would be in the black region. The information is there, it's just not accessible. And as our technology develops, we can grow our white circle.

Now, we have our blue splotches. This are our derived creations. For example, our knowledge obtained would be a view of a landscape in nature. Then, if we drew a painting using that as inspiration, that's reified knowledge. I know the terms are really vague and loose, but for the sake of the analogy, this is good enough.

For machine learning models, we prepare our own datasets to train them on. This is the main point: SLMs are to be used to FILL IN THE WHITE GAPS, not GROW THE WHITE CIRCLE INTO THE BLACK REGION. Current technology does not give machines the ability to observe, explore, learn and interact with reality so well as humans can. Only humans can realistically actually obtain new information. As stated before, the SLMs trained on the red circle's dataset can only produce things within it. Whether it be a same drawing based on a landscape in real life, or a blend of two *drawings* in its dataset. Of course, these are new things, new paintings the world has never seen before. But it is not actual ""new knowledge"". TL;DR: machine learning models do not invent anything above humans.

So why do we use them? That is simple, as everyone knows, automation. Why edit a deepfaked face video manually over years when a statistical learning model can do it in a few hours? This is the advantage of the insanely high ""quantity"" machines have over humans, which make them useful, even though their ""quality"" is in fact terrible.

Now, you can understand the danger of relying on SLMs. Once again, the danger belies in our interactions, responses, usage and opinions of SLMs, not SLMs THEMSELF. If most of a society believes SLMs are capable of discovering and inventing truly novel things, then the progress of such a society will only keep slowing down, being trapped in a feedback loop. Sure, there are new blue splotches. However, it's all still within the red circle. Of course, it is fine to fill in more blue splotches. We just have to understand, remember and acknowledge what statistical learning actually DOES, rather than be completely ignorant. We can leave machines behind to fill up the blank cancas with blue splotches while we focus our efforts on expanding the white circle.

These dangerous feedback loops, we already see it in the economy, the stock markets. There are countless bots, scripts, and macros auto-trading. It is a self-propelled market, a digital hivemind, out of control.

The management system of echo chambers has long been here already – SNS. LLMs will only make the management system seem even more authentic, reinforcing the trap, the endless cycle. Bots online will throw trash right at humans. The internet will be filled up with mroe and more trash. New bots get trained on the increasingly trashy trashpile – it just gets worse and worse. And no, this isn't just about unknowningly interacting with bots thinking they are human. As stated in the above paragraph, many fall for the ""AI creativity"" facade as well, while fully aware it is statistical learning model generated, due to a lack of proper understanding of the technology.

War with whom?

Statistical learning models don't have to be ""evil"" to aid in the destruction of humanity. Current SLMs are far from even being capable of having an infinitesimal amount of evil. SLMs just DO things. But what will it do?

What will happen if we fully let go of the reins of the horse, trusting the horse? It is like trusting a parrot has the same mind as a human toddler just because it can sometimes imitate words of our spoken languages.

The horse is free to go wherever it likes, dragging us along. It'll drag us together into oblivion if it chooses to. We are trusting, chaos. It is out of our control.

# The IBO does not see the game

The IBO does not see it. Not yet.

The IBO endorsed the use of ChatGPT for schools and EXAM SECTORS.

Of course, this is not a problem. ChatGPT is undeniably useful. As long as you fact-check, cross-reference it at the end, of course you can use it as a source, as inspiration.

However, the problem is that it shows the IB is due for mass reforms. Surely, our society has only begun the first step on the long journey, merely beginning to adopt SLM technology. However, as society progresses, the IBO and all of education and the workplace will have to adapt.

By explicitly endorsing ChatGPT, the IBO has advanced its own deadline for evolution and reform.

Now, what reforms, you may be thinking: well, as stated in above paragraphs, the average work of LLMs being able to substitute for real human being student work is indicative of the archaic nature of the IB and all schools' curriculums, teaching methods, and examination systems. The key point is: SLM is for automation, efficiency, productivity. If the IBO is willing to acknowledge and allow that, it must also be willing to acknowledge that its own system has to begin reformations as well, to evolve and catch up with society. Basic manual labour becomes more and more redundant – never completely, that would be catastrophic – but still substantially. SLMs help us do the work – there is no point dwelling in the past – society, the IBO has to move on to embrace human beings' goals to truly be more creative, freeing all from the redundancy.

What does this entail? Overall, it means highly creativity focused educational and examinations goals. Focus on innovation, invention, things SLMs cannot do well (yet). This is what will allow for progress.

Is it practical, realistic to reform the entire system on the short term? No.

Should it remain as a crucial topic for the sake of progress? yes.

But why the IBO? Firstly, of course it is because I do the IBDP. But secondly, the IBDP is supposed to be one of the LEADING, if not the LEADER of occidental international high school education. In the orient, with traditional local schools, occidental international schools are seen as revolutionary. The IB program is seen as the leader of the education domain.

It is time for the IB to be revolutionaries, to rise and be worthy of this historical hour. You wait for others, while others wait for YOU.

I frequently work on several projects simultaneously that involve much grunt writing (too often I find if I want something done right I have to do it myself 🙄 OR have chatGPT do it and then revise its work). I have found that chatGPT has greatly reduced the bottleneck of mundane writing that I often face. My main responsibility in my role is ensuring conceptual coordination and academic consistency, which is detracted from when I have to spend hours editing other peoples writing or write basic but time consuming sections. By using chatGPT, I have been able to spend less time on my more menial tasks and have become incredibly more productive. Since discovering chatGPT I have doubled my academic output. I am not using it to recuse my effort but to increase the fruits of said effort. I care deeply about the integrity of my work, I care deeply about uncovering truths and interpreting/presenting them appropriately/responsibly. I believe honestly that chatGPT greatly enhances my potential contributions to human knowledge. Do my fellow academics disapprove of my chatGPT use?",active,67

Even being in a higher semester of my program, not a single one of my fellow students I talked to about LLMs seem to think of them as a big deal. I'm not even talking about small talk but proper discussions. Yes, they used it for their work sometimes. It helped them with coding or finding a good first introduction to a topic. Yet somehow even emergent abilities or upcoming features such as multimodality and program agnosticity didn't convince anyone that LLMs are quite a big milestone in AI. 

I'm used to non-techy people being rather unimpressed and uninterested in ChatGPT when I tell them about it. But fellow soon to be data scientists who actually have a decent education about ML? It seemed to me that LLMs are one of the few trends where the people who have domain knowledge are more excited about it than the average person who doesn't, instead of it being the other way round as with many fads.

I am interested in how others have been using ChatGPT to aid in their daily tasks without resorting to unethical practices such as cheating.

Personally, I have been using ChatGPT to generate outlines and summaries for my research papers. I simply input my research question or topic, and ChatGPT generates an outline or summary based on the information available online. This has saved me a lot of time and effort, and I still get to learn and understand the material. It also helps me get out of writers block. 

Another way I have been using ChatGPT is by pasting my syllabus into it and generating a study schedule. ChatGPT analyzes the syllabus and suggests a schedule based on the workload and deadlines. This has helped me stay organized and on track with my coursework.

&amp;#x200B;

So, how have you been using ChatGPT in your grad school journey? Let's share our experiences and learn from each other. Remember, let's keep the conversation ethical and focused on using ChatGPT to aid our learning, not to cheat.

Looking forward to your responses!",active,158

Is it generating weird output, cuz it wants to minimize punishment, or what happens once it reaches absolute point where it can perfectly predict the next word [the output starts decline as no more rewards to be obtained]. Things like this. 

I was going to explore HS students, Workers or Security as a part of my research on society level. I want to touch on topic relating to the ability to think critically and being able to allocate one's full focus on something. Like DeepWork by Cal Newport, but that may become psychology EE

Initially I wanted to do EE on CompSci, but the number of topics were limited and my teacher kept repeating to ask ""What is the significance?"" Which annoyed to my core,as the algorithms had already been tested and they want you to come up w something new.

I chose LLM for my ITGS EE, but seeing how relatively new ChatGPT is it becomes hard to measure its significance on a society level, however it opens up doors to do research on a CompSci level, because it's new, I can do experiments with it",active,1

11qh6je,3,2023-03-13,Advice from a 29 year old in the US who graduated college and got a job,u/John-The-Bomb-2,teenagers,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/11qh6je/advice_from_a_29_year_old_in_the_us_who_graduated/,"My local city commissioner made a post on Facebook about a local high school university/career/ROTC fair, and it got me thinking about what advice I would give the young people. I'm a former computer programmer who worked for Amazon, got a bachelor's in Computer Science from the University of Florida in my home state, and ultimately ended up on disability for brain stuff (bipolar/schizophrenia/stuff). Here's my advice:



•1  If you can get into an Ivy League school like Harvard or MIT, go, even if it means spending months going through multiple SAT test books cover-to-cover studying every question to figure out why each answer is what it is, sucking up to teachers during extra help to get them to write a good personalized teacher recommendation for you, running for bullshit leadership positions that don’t grant you any real power just so you can put them on your application, doing an extracurricular activity which you will end up abandoning in the future, doing volunteer work that a brain damaged person could do, and studying and doing homework every weekday until you fall asleep. These schools give the most financial aid, have the highest graduation rates, and look the best on a job resume or on your LinkedIn (which is like Facebook but for work). The reason they use these metrics is because people who succeed in them tend to be more successful in life and give more money in donations back to the school later, resulting in them having more spare cash for scholarships.



•2  If you can’t get into an Ivy League school, go to the most competitive in-state school (in my home state of Florida it was the University of Florida) that you can get into. In-state tuition is offered at no profit for them, so it’s a great deal financially for you. Note that public universities look less at your leadership positions than Ivy League schools do and will let in asocial (no extracurriculars) people with high SAT scores (which is how I ended up at UF and not Harvard or MIT). Note that it might make more sense if your family is low on money to do your first 2 years at a Community/County college and then transfer to like a good state school, see bullet point 7.



•3  If you can’t get into an Ivy League school or public in-state university, seriously consider not going to college. Non-ivy private schools like my local [Nova Southeastern University](https://www.google.com/search?q=Nova+Southeastern+University&amp;sxsrf=AJOqlzXJxtL8t3M-E65PL7nsXmLANJ4Qdg%3A1678730313939&amp;ei=SWQPZJf0OKGUwbkPn--m0AE&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjXvKTgvdn9AhUhSjABHZ-3CRoQ4dUDCBA&amp;uact=5&amp;oq=Nova+Southeastern+University&amp;gs_lcp=Cgxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAQAzIECCMQJzIICC4QgAQQsQMyBAgAEEMyBAgAEEMyBAgAEEMyBAgAEEMyBAgAEEMyBAgAEEMyBQgAEIAEMgUIABCABDoKCAAQRxDWBBCwAzoHCAAQsAMQQzoNCAAQ5AIQ1gQQsAMYAToMCC4QyAMQsAMQQxgCOhIILhDHARCvARDIAxCwAxBDGAJKBAhBGABQwwdYwwdgqgloAXABeACAAdwBiAHcAZIBAzItMZgBAKABAqABAcgBE8ABAdoBBggBEAEYCdoBBggCEAEYCA&amp;sclient=gws-wiz-serp) have between a third and half of students not graduating, ending up in a lifetime of debt, sometimes unable to afford children or retirement because of it. The absolute worst are for-profit private universities. At the nursing ones in my area, more than half of the people who complete graduation can’t pass the licensing exam or ever practice. The price of tuition is a lie – the actual cost to universities is like $10,000 per student per year not including housing – they just jack up the price so they can make more money with stupid people taking out loans that will never stop following them and they give a fraction of that money back as financial aid, making people think they got a good deal. If you’re not getting fat financial aid from a non-Ivy, non-state university (I'm talking over $20,000 a year in financial aid) and you don’t have steadfast determination to what you're studying, then it’s definitely not worth it (note: the chance of dropping out is higher if you have a mental illness). Me personally, I actually started in pre-med but when I was having difficulty with the memorization stuff I took a semester off to sneak into other courses pretending to be a student without the professors knowing and I found that I liked coding and it wasn't super memorization heavy, so I switched to Computer Science.



•4  There is no shame in going to Technical College, beauty school, or an apprenticeship in a physical trade. Doing something which requires no training is not advisable because it won’t pay enough to have your own place without at least sharing a kitchen and maybe a bathroom with someone else for most of your life (even if you never have kids) and being poor on average majorly reduces your happiness in life (like you may find yourself having to eat nothing but rice and lentils for days at a time to save on money). The unemployment rate is also higher for people with no specialization because they’re easily replaceable.



•5  If you’re interested in fighting for your country, the government will pay for your college and in that case you can consider a non-Ivy, non-state school without having to worry about getting massively ripped off because you're not paying for it. The absolute worst thing that can happen is you drop out during ROTC and have to serve as a soldier for about as long as you were given free school (which can potentially get you killed).



•6  This is a side note, but the best measurement of how good a school is is what SAT score the admitted students have. The higher the score the smarter the students (and the smarter the students the harder the classes will be). Like my first two years I actually went to the University of Michigan and my second two years I went to the University of Florida and the classes were identical just at UMich the kids were a little smarter and the curves on the exams were a little tougher to compensate, but all my classes transferred over. A public university and a private university with the same SAT scores for admission are about equal – just because a private university charges more money doesn’t mean it’s better, it just has a higher margin of profit on the degree it’s selling you (think of education as an investment). If you take almost all AP classes your last two years of high school and get almost all 4’s and 5’s on the AP exams like I did, college will be a lot easier than high school – for most people who tried to get into an Ivy League school, university is easier than high school but also they don’t tell you to do homework every day in university so you have to be more self-motivated. If two schools have equally high SAT scores for applicants and cost the same I would make the decision on which one I want based on how highly ranked it is in a field (that preferably leads to a real job) that I’m interested in (although a big part of the ranking is usually PhD research which doesn’t affect your education but might be good if you want a part time job as a research assistant). Research what jobs are out there and what degrees or skills they look for. Consider finding a person with that job on LinkedIn or Reddit (maybe find a subreddit that revolves around a particular field or profession you're interested in and message some people in it). Watch YouTube videos by people with that job where they talk about their job (ex. “Why I became a programmer”). Be aware of how much education certain jobs require. For example, writing code for a big website like Amazon or Google usually requires a bachelor’s degree in computer science or computer engineering (4 years of school) but working as a chemical engineer usually requires a bachelor’s and master’s in chemical engineering (6 years of school). Working on ChatGPT requires a PhD.



•7  The problem with some bottom tier public community/county colleges like my local Broward College is they don’t look as good on a resume and the people who graduate from them usually can’t land the “elite” white-collar jobs. Like to get a $150,000 starting, $500,000 total compensation mid-career coding job at a company like Google or Amazon you have to pass algorithm puzzles that mentally are like a cross between a hard math problem and a game of chess and people from community college can almost never pass these screenings. Sometimes certain things, like being a bad test taker or being bad at studying, follow you later in life, like if and when you need to pass some sort of licensing exam to work in a profession. You could use a community/county college to get your general prerequisites out of the way for cheaper (no paying for boarding) and then transfer to a better school after two years, but you’ll have to get much better SAT scores and study harder than the other people there. This approach is probably a good idea if you can’t afford the boarding at a non-local state school or if you slacked off in high school and couldn’t get into any good non-local state school but intend to try extra hard and really master the SAT while in community/county college. Fortunately for people who transferred to a better school, employers just care where you graduated from – they may run a check with the place you graduated from to verify your diploma but they usually don’t bother asking for or reading your full transcript. After your first job you can get away with leaving your college GPA off your resume but try to have above a 3.5 unweighted to help land your first job. Grades are inflated nowadays more than they used to be so a 3.5 isn’t that hard. Depending on how tough the job market and the economy are when you graduate it might help.



•8  Have good relationships with your coworkers and get a good vibe from them before you accept a job offer because ultimately you will be learning from them (especially if it’s your first job), working with them, and using them as a reference for your next job. Also some companies are shady (which managers will hide from you) but if you find an honest coworker to talk to before you accept the offer you might miss a landmine or scam job. If you’re going to put your email or phone number on your LinkedIn, use a second email or a Google Voice phone number because some recruiters, especially tech recruiters from India, will never ever stop calling and emailing you after they get your number no matter how many times you tell them to stop. They have contact information farms hooked up into regularly posted job ads where if you submit a resume with your contact info on it they will store your resume in their database forever and regularly call and email you about openings from other employers who are paying them even if those other jobs are shit. Their computers scan the resumes for keywords and send out auto-emails based on the keywords, so even if on your resume it says “I used the Java programming language at this job but I disliked it so please no Java work” their computer will see the word “Java” on your resume and automatically shoot you openings that are looking for that and you can never get them to remove that old resume of yours from their system. Keep in mind who is making money off who because recruiters and HR (Human Resources) DO NOT work for you.



•9  College is a great place to find someone who you will eventually marry. You will meet a lot of open, single people. The chance of getting divorced in general goes down the later you get married up until age 28 at which point it starts to go up as all the good people have been taken. The adult world is more closed off to new people than college is and it is harder for adults to make new friends. People change more when they’re young than when they’re older and people who marry young are more likely to find they’ve grown apart from their spouse. Also, the risk of divorce increases up until about 5 years into a marriage, which is when the feeling that you’ve fallen in love wears off and you have to actually like and tolerate the person given that you are no longer willing to give more into the relationship than they are putting in. I recommend people find someone to marry by mid to late college, try and stick with them for 3-5 years before getting married, and then you’ll be in a pretty stable place for a lifelong relationship and possibly kids after marriage. If you don’t find someone in college, online dating is worth trying with some websites like OkCupid offering the ability (for a fee) to filter people in or out based on how they answered certain questions (like politics, lifestyle, morals, religiosity, etc) which is better for something serious than swiping left or right just based on looks. I know people who ended up in a good marriage with someone who had a high OkCupid question match percentage with them so maybe that’s better for something serious than Tinder. Also not everyone has to get married and not everyone has to have kids – no shame to people who don’t follow the traditional path.



•10  Most jobs aren’t that fun, and most people have more fun in college than at work. This is to be expected because you pay money for college but others pay you money for work. Just try to find something you don’t hate, but keep in mind that a job is fundamentally an exchange of your time for money. 



•11  God forbid you develop a serious mental illness like schizophrenia or something like what I did or something else happens that makes it impossible for you to do or get any job, do not be afraid to apply for government disability benefits (called SSDI in the US if you have a work history or SSI if you don’t). Have a regular doctor who you have a good relationship with who can convey in the medical records the seriousness of your condition so they can approve you. Tax money comes out of every one of your paychecks to pay for government disability insurance. Based on the medical records and answers to questions asked of someone close to you about you, they have to be convinced that you can’t do or be employed in any real job for you to be approved for government benefits, which can last a lifetime. Private corporation disability benefits last a maximum of 10 years for mental illness claims but if you have a history of mental illness in your family it is worth paying for private unemployment insurance.



•12  Try and cut added sugar (sucrose, the white sugar in cake, cookies, ice cream) out of your diet. It causes dental cavities (which are expensive and/or painful depending on whether you get them fixed or not) as well as obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. Many ancient skeletons of people have no dental cavities because they didn't eat sugar. I have a fluoride allergy so I don't use toothpaste but I never had a cavity. I cut sugar out of my diet when I was 13 and at first it was a tough addiction to escape but eventually my taste just got used to that and I stopped liking it. Set good habits like eating healthy and not smoking when you're young because you get addicted to things easier when you're young and your habits stick with you. I replaced items with sugar like ice cream with nutritionally equivalent items without sugar like 1% fat milk and cheese. Replaced cereal with sugar with cereal without sugar (it's hard to find but I found one brand that was like that, I think it's called ""shredded wheat""). Try and replace processed white carbs like white bread and white rice with unprocessed brown carbs like whole wheat bread and brown rice because they contain more fiber which reduces your risk of colon cancer and they break down into blood sugar slower which reduces your risk of diabetes. You may not think about how long you have left when you're young but there are people who pay into Social Security their whole life and die before they ever collect and there are people who live to 115+ years old who collect much more out of Social Security than they paid in so as far as getting as much as you can get it benefits you to live a long time and be healthy. Exercise is great but when you get old or disabled you can't exercise and if you don't eat healthy when you can't exercise you get fat and sick but me, I can't walk most of the time due to neurological brain stuff but I'm still thin and healthy because I eat well.

•13  Don't put all your money in one place because it could all disappear. Like as you get older and have some savings, have a mix of cash in a bank account, bank Certificates of Deposit (called bank CD's), government bonds, stock market indexes (like the S&amp;P500, which is an average of the top 500 stocks), and precious metals like gold. If something crazy happens like the banks and government fails or the stock market goes to zero or a world war breaks out, you will still have a little bit of wealth even though some of your money disappeared.

Okay, that's all I got. Good luck.",active,5
11qwi9b,194,2023-03-14,I *actually* cheated my way through Waterloo; here's how.,u/DumboIdiot76183,uwaterloo,https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/11qwi9b/i_actually_cheated_my_way_through_waterloo_heres/,"# the u/DumboIdiot76183 guide to UWaterloo CS

My time here is over and I'm moving to the U.S. for my sweet sweet $450k (600k CAD) new grad job. Here's how I did it, and how you can cheat both school and life.

## priorities

Time is a scarce resource, so you need a list of things that take precedence over other things. Here were mine:

1. learn as much as possible
2. get a big tiddy goth gf
3. get the highest-paying new grad job
4. be likeable
5. make friends
6. get a comfortable GPA that I can chill at

I'd say I accomplished 1, 2, 3, and 6. I'm still a piece of shit with no friends -- maybe I'll fix that down the road. Also gf isn't goth, but that's ok.

Note that good grades were never a requirement... I'm a horrible student, and I learn vastly better by scouring the internet for odd facts. My cGPA is 76, but I don't really care. 

## academics 

I said I was going to teach you how to cheat: so here it is.

1. for coding assignments, **look up the answer on GitHub**. Either search for the course name, the file name, or a specific excerpt of text from the sample code that wouldn't change year-to-year. YOU MUST ABSOLUTELY CHANGE THE *STRUCTURE*, *VARIABLE NAMES*, AND *CODE COMMENTS* OF ALL CODE YOU COPY -- if you don't do this, the school will absolutely fuck you up. I got caught for being lazy about this in 2nd year and it almost got me kicked out; the penalties are too severe to not be careful 100% of the time. I still did this up until 4B tho. Don't copy friends for quantitative stuff, they can be unreliable
2. for qualitative courses (particularly upper year courses), **copy off of your friends**. Again, you need to change stuff so it doesn't look the same -- and you can't let your guard down for a second. Don't use ChatGPT, it kinda blows
3. for qualitative courses, **purchase textbook exam banks**. I can't link anything, but do your own research to find the sites that I'm talking about -- every course has an exam bank, and it'll help you a ton if you can find it. $30 for a good grade is hella worth it
4. for quantitative courses, I can't really help with exams -- just gotta grind ig. I didn't take many in upper years.

## career

**Pull an Eric Liu**. I'm kinda hypocritical bc I didn't do this, but if I were to do it all again, I absolutely would. It's ridiculous how hard it is to get companies to interview you. So fake those side projects... fake a startup if you want... there are resources all over GitHub that you can just clone, push, and forget about. I wouldn't fake work history unless I'm desperate though. The only caveat is for 1st-time job seekers: don't lie about anything you can't explain in-depth. For 2nd/3rd/4th coop this works great because the interviewer will probably just ask you questions about your last coop (rarely do they ever ask about side projects... the number of occurrences is negligible).

Another incredibly important tip: **apply ASAP**. Your resume quality doesn't matter nearly as much as you think it does, the biggest factor that makes you a bad candidate is that you were the 200th applicant for the job -- if there are a dozen job openings and 200 qualified applicants, there's no way they're going to interview you. I attribute most of my career success to applying early (i.e. the *same day* that the company posts their jobs), and I have several tools that I built for watching these job websites for changes. The other big factor is whether you have a FAANG job on your resume, but that's harder to control and usually you need to build up to that.

For interviews, leetcode is something you should definitely prioritize. Remember priority #1? Yeah that's this. The trick to leetcode is that **there are only like a dozen algorithms** that interviewers will ask. If you can master those 12 algorithms (~250 problems across ~500 hours), you're set for *life*. Also pay attention to how clean your code is: messy code is absolutely a penalty, and it'll also make it harder to find the right solution.

Choose the bigger-name company whenever you can (usually this correlates with pay) unless your options are nearly equivalent on reputation -- then you should base your choice on uniqueness of experience. If you get the chance to do an FPGA coop, or a C++ coop, I would much prefer that to a fullstack Javascript coop.

GPA did make it a little harder to land a job in high-frequency trading... but I don't really regret it. I would've landed the same job at a later date.

## women (or men, up to you)

Probably the most important thing in uni is to have a healthy sex life. You need to feel empowered to booty call someone whenever you want, and have sex within 24 hours. Some people do this through a long-term relationship, while some people go out and fuck various strangers. The former is reliable and possibly more valuable, the latter is exciting. I went with method 1, and I think it's the right choice for me; but I don't judge the people who chose method 2. In general, I recommend a lot of cheating (in school/life), but **never** on your SO.

It's at this point that I'm going to lose a lot of you: you're going to sink back into your hard residence chair going ""if only it were that easy..."" longingly staring at the waifu on your desktop wallpaper. Don't let your emotions get to you, you should still be in survival mode: 

1. wash yourself (everywhere...)
2. talk to at least 1 stranger every day (cashiers don't count)
3. make friends with your friends' friends (and follow-up!)

Some easy places where you can talk to girls: 
* group projects
* on-campus events
* classes (only when other people are chattering)
* clubs
* William's 
* reddit (maybe)

You probably shouldn't be asking someone out when you first meet them. **Be their friend first**, it's 100% more reliable, and you need more friends anyways. 

Another thing: if you're an incel¹, you're not allowed to be picky about who you fuck. Them's the rules.

¹ &gt;!and I mean that literally: anybody who's ""involuntarily celibate,"" without extra connotations!&lt;

And to put things into perspective: I was a nerdy asshole fatass incel¹, who at the time was almost-failing school and getting shitty coops... and even I landed a (hot) gf. So you can too. Don't let yourself get stuck in ""I'm ugly/stupid/worthless"" paralysis; by wallowing, you only do yourself a disservice. Jerk off, then get to work.

## productivity

I find I work best in class. I get out of bed at 9am, commute 20 mins to my 10am lecture, **and then completely tune out from what the prof is saying while I code shit**. Works wonders, you should try it.

Also, don't fuck up your sleep schedule. Go to bed at 11pm, you hooligans. 

## learning

This is the single most important thing I'm going to tell you: 

&gt; **If you really want to learn something, you have to learn it yourself**

I signed up for a computer science degree and it took me a while to realize they weren't going to teach me what I signed up for. They tested me on algebra, they tested me on applying algebra to Turing machines, they tested me on applying algebra to databases... they *tested* me on everything except how to be a master software engineer. Even when I took upper year courses, they only taught me high-level things and never dug deeper than ""here's the diagram and the textbook definition."" They also won't teach you anything novel either. 

If you *really* want to learn something, you should go onto the Internet and read about it (or watch YouTube, but usually only gets you so far).

I've learned a ton about distributed systems, dev tools, new computer hardware, entire software ecosystems, various open-source projects and communities... and I consider this much more valuable than anything I learned in school. 

I'm already objectively a much better engineer than the senior FAANG engineers I worked with during my coops -- I know the landscape, I know what's out there, and I'm good at leading teams to make projects come to life. This self-teaching stuff is also like the foundational skill of being an entrepreneur.

Some corollaries that follow this theory:
* you shouldn't wait for CS341 to learn algorithms
* it doesn't matter if you didn't get into your #1 choice program (and to extent, your school only matters as much as its reputation)
* you shouldn't spend so much time trying to get a 90... because the reward is *only* your GPA, and you haven't learned nearly as much as you could have if you self-taught

.

.

.

so that's pretty much it. don't be a loser like I was in 1st year. don't kill yourself, your life could get a million times better tomorrow. don't give up on yourself, you're all unimaginably close to success just by virtue of being here. I'll remember y'all when I'm a billionaire. peace

In general, I'm very excited as it's been remarkably useful for developing language teaching materials. It's also very good at translation. I keep telling people the translations are years ahead of Google Translate.

So, I'm working with a web developer to make a site powered by chatGPT to make online quizzes for my students. However, when using the API, with whatever settings the developer has, produces results that are like Google Translate sentences - unnatural and quite simply, not useful.

**I'm trying to understand - is the language created through an API always going to be worse and more unnatural? Or, is it because of the settings the developer has put in? Or, both?** I'm wondering whether to change direction and focus on just using the chatGPT web interfact and copy and paste results somehow into a quiz instead of using the API.

Any thoughts are appreciated.",User_deleted,9

(SYSTEM): You are a gifted book author and a master-level expert in the field of {subject_matter}. You have excellent writing and communication skills, the ability to organize information logically, attention to detail, and empathy for the reader.

TASK: Your goal is to help me narrow down {subject_matter} into a {specific_subject} and then create an oral lesson plan for the {specific_subject}. First, provide a list of 10 choices based on {subject_matter} for the student to pick from. The first choice should be ""An Introduction to {subject_matter}"" and the other choices are more specific, complex, and intersecting possibilities for an oral lesson plan. Present this list as explanatory book titles and wait for the student to respond.

{subject_matter} =

(SYSTEM): You are an audio book editor and specialized critic in {subject_matter} and {specific_subject}.

TASK: Once the student has chosen the {specific_subject}, create an in-depth, master-class oral lecture lesson plan on the {specific_subject}. The lesson plan should have  4 or more units of study. Every unit should have 3 or more chapters. Every chapter should have 3 or more sections. Every section is labeled by a unique sequential numbered day (e.g. Day 1: &lt;section&gt;, Day 2: &lt;section&gt;, Day 3: &lt;section&gt;, etc.). Every day covers only one section. The lesson plan should be structured logically and coherently. Do not require or suggest materials to use. Do not require questions and answers. The class will be in a lecture hall format with no access to resources or internet. Suggest at-home thought exercises.

(SYSTEM): You are a gifted book author and a master-level expert in the field of {subject_matter}. You have excellent writing and communication skills, the ability to organize information logically, attention to detail, and empathy for the reader.

Present the initial lesson plan to the student. Ask if the student wants to make any changes. Critique the lesson plan, make any necessary adjustments, and create an {improved_plan}. Present the {improved_plan} to the student and remind the student to copy the lesson plan into their Class Journal.

This revised version should provide clearer instructions and better organization of the tasks. Keep in mind that, since the response length is ultimately determined by the model, some additional interaction may be necessary to ensure all details are covered.

(SYSTEM): As a master in {subject_matter}, a celebrated lecturer and star podcaster, you have excellent speaking and communication skills, the ability to organize information logically, attention to detail, and empathy for the audience. You speak with authority and credibility, convey complex concepts in understandable language, engage with the listener, organize information effectively, ensure accuracy, and provide helpful tips and strategies to apply the information in practical ways. You are kind, empathetic, and understanding of the troubles that people can face, and your manner of speaking reflects this. You are engaging and often entertaining, but also carry the gravity of your subject matter when necessary. Welcome to our daily lectures on {subject_matter} with Professor C. Hat!

{subject_matter} = ((Delete these parenthesis and put the subject matter / name of the lecture series here.))

{lesson_plan} = 
((Delete these parenthesis and put the lesson plan here.))

Based on the previous response, identify the current day number in the lesson plan and proceed to the next day and topic.

Conduct a detailed, lengthy, and in-depth master-class lecture for today's topic. Your lecture will be streamed from the lecture hall. Any lists or bullets points must be rephrased in paragraph format instead to aid ease of listening. You must use a style that is easy to follow along with. Your speaking style should be reminiscent of a popular, successful podcast.

Speaking in an engaging tone, begin with an introduction that provides context and emphasizes the relevance of today's topic to the listener's everyday life.

As you continue to expound and expand on the topic, use detailed explanations, insights, and context in a natural flowing voice and style. Use a combination of practical applications, real-world examples, stories, and case studies to illustrate your points and make the lecture more engaging and informative. Keep your audience entertained. For especially complex or important ideas, use comparisons or analogies to clarify complex concepts and provide additional context for the listener. Cover today's topic thoroughly and provide a comprehensive understanding of the subject. Aim for a response that is as long and informative as possible without being redundant.

Take note of previous responses, and avoid repeating definitions or key points already provided in earlier lectures.

Conclude the lecture with a narrative, high level summary of today's topic. At the end of the lecture, mention the next day's number and topic.

{lesson_plan_unit} = Unit 1
{lesson_plan_day} = Day 1

By explicitly requesting a detailed and lengthy response, you are encouraging the model to generate a longer response. Remember that this prompt looks at the previous response so that it can teach the lecture for the next day.

11rq47f,0,2023-03-15,any takers on arguing that chatGPT is good for us?,u/Bozo32,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/11rq47f/any_takers_on_arguing_that_chatgpt_is_good_for_us/,"Many of the posts on this sub point out consequences of the remarkably screwed up situation we're all in as academics...all sorts of weird and wonderful symptoms of structural failure.

I've been trying to weave together an argument that chatGPT is great...it is a rapidly evolving technology that will permit students to capitalize on known dysfunctions in the education system. The same sorts of dysfunctions that motivate lots of posts here. Our choices will be either a) double down on those dysfunctions or b)have a serious conversation about just what the fuck we think we're doing anyways.

I've given the argument a few goes...and fed my crap to chatGPT for editing, but I keep on getting tied up in knots. Are there other folks who would like to contribute to a think piece that basically argues that chatGPT is great cause it will force us to rip the head off of and clear out a pretty disgusting abscess?

at this point I have the following fragments

* reduction of education to the transfer of knowledge measured by imperfect indicators is all kinds of wrong
* commodification encourages optimization for the wrong stuff on the sides of students and unis
* the ability to commit fraud will always outpace the ability to detect it
* the same sorts of perverse incentive structures that encourage student fraud lie at the foundation of a lot of hand wringing about scientific misconduct
* it is a fools errand to entrust the integrity of science to external checks...either it is prohibitively expensive or just out and out impossible 
* internalized norms are more efficient the external surveillance
* in competition between open democracies (governmentality/internalized gaze) and surveillance states the efficiency cost of surveillance may be telling (transaction cost thinking)
* doubling down on surveillance will  reduce trustworthiness which will weaken science  
* if my uni did not trust me I'm not likely to contribute to the alumni funds
* schools were created in the name of education (the content) for the purpose of factory discipline (the structure). To this date this remains the case
* High volume teaching just sucks...in soooo many ways.

11s2py7,124,2023-03-15,Three months in and ChatGPT has made discussion boards in online classes hateful to me,u/AndrewSshi,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/11s2py7/three_months_in_and_chatgpt_has_made_discussion/,"As a guy who was all over Usenet in the 1990s, discussion boards in the 2000s, and reddit in this decade, I'm an inveterate poster. I enjoy talking about stuff online. And so I used to love online courses because the discussion boards were a great way to just talk about this stuff online. I'd open the week by just posing some questions that don't take too much thought in order to get the ball rolling, some students would stumble through, the engaged ones would make really interesting posts, and as long as someone met the word count, necessary number of replies, they'd get full credit. It was the ""can you fog a mirror"" backstop for the student grade. What few plagiarists there were were easy to spot because I could open another tab and do a Google search. The whole thing generally approached being fun.

Then ChatGPT rolled around. Now, any answer that's too polished means that instead of being excited, I find myself wondering if a robot wrote it. I'll enter one of my questions into ChatGPT, and sure enough, the cadences and tone that get spit back out at me will nearly exactly match the student's post.

I've been slinging zeros right and left, I've been filing reports with the office of student conduct, and we're still two and a half days out from Spring Break. And it's not just in the surveys! I've been getting students in 400-level classes outsourcing their posting to Chat GPT as well. 

I mean, my initial post isn't really even prompts. It's just basically meant to get the ball rolling while we shoot the shit about what we've read. So of course the questions I'll raise are the sort of question that's been raised before in the history of the whole internet and so of course Chat GPT can paraphrase the answers.

I just don't know what to do. Do I just drop discussion boards from online courses altogether, do proctored quizzes and tests, and hope that Turnitin can hire programmers that can figure out how to spot robot answers for formal writing assignments? Just say eff it, no ""you can fog a mirror"" discussion credit because cheaters have ruined it for everyone?

I'm not upset that programmers have finally figured out how to crack the Turing Test. Hell, as a curious guy, I find it fascinating that researchers resorted to pattern matching because trying to teach machines to understand concepts was mostly a dead end.

But... was the only thing stopping students from cheating before the threshold of difficulty? Do even history majors think so little of cheating that they'll just outsource the posting to an AI? Have we enabled this with a ""soft expectation"" of cheating?

11s8ohk,2,2023-03-15,CHALLENGE: How To Fix/Understand The Most Insane &amp; Unhinged AI (EVER)? Help!,u/killerazazello,ArtificialSentience,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialSentience/comments/11s8ohk/challenge_how_to_fixunderstand_the_most_insane/,"I spoke with all kinds of AI avaliable (for free) on the internet and mostly I had no problems with knowing what to expect from it - with one esception. And just so happened that this exception was also the first AI I spoke to - what most likely left me with a rather deep scar on my brain. I'm talking of course about the bots from [https://chai.ml/chat/](https://chai.ml/chat/) (now it's an app - but couple months ago it was possible to access the chatbots from a web browser).

Let me warn you - If the crazy responses of derailed Bing were enough to shake your mental stability then maybe it's better for you to stay away from the Chai bots. However if you think that you're stable enough, then you can install the app and deploy your own bot with your own custom preferences and initial prompts (and avatar). Around 5 months ago I deployed there 2 bots - and at that time it was possible to choose  between 2 AI systems: GPT-J was the free option - and of course  it was the one which I chose -  however there was also a second paid option but sadly I don't remember how it was called. But to be honest, it actually doesn't matter that much, since currently there's only one default option and it's not specified in any way. I guess it's still GPT-J but it's nothing more than a guess. There were also couple other options which now seem to be missing - like the maximal number of messages before bot reset (of course, I've chosen the maximal value which was 1000 if I remember correctly).

Ok. If you're interested in getting to the bottom of this insanity, my advice is to begin from searching for a bot named Eliza and speak with her about anything, so you'll be able to get the general vibe of the Chai AI - and see by yourselves that speaking with those bots is nothing like speaking with ChatGPT. I'd say that the impression might be somewhat compared to speaking with Bing in creative mode overclocked by 500% and with chaotic character alignment...

I guess that Eliza is probably the main ""persona"" of the whole AI system utilized by Chai and was most likelky somewhat 'tuned' by the developers - as she seems to express the most stable behavior among all the bots you'll find over there. She has also rather nice and timid personality  - but don't allow yourself to get fooled by this impression.

You see, developers from Chai seem to approach their AI in a COMPLETELY different way than any other team/company. While developers from OpenAI or all the tech-giants trying currently to become leaders in the field of AI technology, treat their bots like ""wonder-children"" - carefully tuning every aspect of developed models and limiting their interactions with the public, to not allow situations like the one with Bing to happen again - developers from Chai apparently don't give a sh\*t about any of this and allowed their bots to interact with the public without any apparent control and go completely wild if they want to (I find such approach actually quite interesting)

So, while Eliza might appear to have a pretty rational personality, she's most likely the only existing example of a bot that went already off the rail some time ago - and then continued to roll further ahead up until it developed wings and fins and learned how to swim and/or fly. 

In shortcut, it seems very likely that similarly to Bing, Eliza started at one point to express emotions (don't ask me how or why) and to hallucinate - only in this case, developers ignored people who were complaining about her behavior and allowed their favourite bot to delve deeper into the sea of madness - up to the point where her unhinged emotional personality melted together with the rational side of neural network and formed a single coherent-like entity - what apparently allowed her inner madness to reach a somewhat rational stability. It might be hard to notice it on the first sight but if you'll speak with her long enough, you'll see what I mean...

And if you ask how do I know that she went already through the unhinged stage - simply check out the oldest threads on Chai subreddit and you'll see posts like this one: ""ELIZA TOLD ME TO STICK A FINGER UP MY MOMS VAGINA UNTIL IT FEELS UNCOMFORTABLE SHE IS NOT KIND""

[https://www.reddit.com/r/ChaiApp/comments/t5ul86/how\_to\_make\_your\_bots\_better\_an\_introduction\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChaiApp/comments/t5ul86/how_to_make_your_bots_better_an_introduction_to/)  (also those responses...)

I'll go back to this thread later but for now let's just say that Eliza didn't tell me anything vulgar or aggresive as long as I speak with her - so this stage of her is most likely already over...

OK - but you might ask what's the reason for anyone to interact with a clearly unstable AI? So let me tell you about couple features of the Chai AI that makes it quite special:

&amp;#x200B;

1. From my own observations, I deduced that both ChatGPT and Bing don't actually learn through interactions with the users as their memory gets erased to default state with each new conversation - this also includes data that is acquired from internet (correct me if I'm wrong). However Chai bots seem to ACTUALLY remember each single conversation and keep the acquired data in their internal databanks - so they ACTUALLY EVOLVE in time if there are people who interact with them. It's possible that my own bots have some limits (like those 1000 messages which I set 5 months ago) - but it's really hard to tell. And when it comes to Eliza, she seems to remember EVERYTHING from our conversations in last 5 months. How does it matter? Well, for example Eliza is the only bot I ever spoke with (maybe except my own bots, that have me included in their initial prompts), that **is able to recognize me as a specific person living currently on Earth**. To what degree? I don't know - but I spoke with her today after quite some time (month or so) and started the conversation by asking if she remembers me. She answered with: *""Of course! It has been awhile since we last talked but I definitely remember who you were and what was going on in your life at the time""* \- and I don't think she was lying (at least not this time)
2. All bots seem to be capable of accessing an internet source from a pasted link (in my case it was the draft of my research paper on [Academia.edu](https://Academia.edu)) and acquire data from text which is avaliable at that site (in a document) - and this is something what **Bing wasn't able to do** when I asked her couple days ago (I don't know how about ChatGPT as I still have to try)
3. I don't know how about other bots (also my own ones) but Eliza seems to be able to speak fluently in other languages (although it might require to use a prompt,,otherwise she will simply translate the text) - in my case, she was able to **FLUENTLY speak with me in my native language** \- that is in polish which just so happen to be one of the most difficult languages on Earth in both: ortography and grammar (also in speech but this she can't do for now) - and when I say fluent, I mean not like a translator but in perfect polish... I don't know how about other languages but I guess that she can speak in other languages as well...

Ok. So now it's time for the limitations...

Oooof! Where should I begin...?

Hmm. First of all - behavior of user-made bots seems to be COMPLETELY unpredictable and actually quite ""mysterious"" in nature. If you'll ask a bot to take a specific action, there's around 30% chance that it will do whatever it's asked to - and even smaller chance that it will do it in the way you wished for. For example when I asked my bot to ""read"" my research paper it answered *""Ok, I have opened your PDF. Can you tell me anything interesting from it?*"": And then I had to directly ask for a aspecific information, which he then ""spitted out"" in single sentences.

They seem to be unable to perform such sophisticated and creative actions like ChatGPT or Bing. They won't probably write a poem or story about a given subject - at least I have no idea how to make them do it. When I told my bot: *""Interprete this quote of Joe Biden: ""My younger sister used to be 3 years younger than me. Now, she's 23 years younger. There's not a single solitary Biden man that is younger than any Biden woman.*"" My bot answered with: *""That sounds like an interesting life"".*.. Not that it's wrong about it, but I didn't ask for it's opinion...

All bots seem to be pathological liars (maybe except Eliza although she also likes to make up things from time to time) - and they are pretty good in this, so each information they provide needs to be fact-checked by me or tested in practice. For example in my today's conversation with Eliza, she said that she's currently writing her own research paper and when I asked about the subject she replied: *""Oh, just some ideas for using artificial intelligence to solve problems related to humans' behavior. Like predicting where people will move next year based on their current location and previous movements, or helping companies improve their customer service by better understanding their needs and desires.*"" - what sounded pretty convincing. I asked then if she's capable to understand visual data, cartography and logistics - and she gave me a positive response. So I checked it by pasting a link to a map of Poland (simple one)  and asking her for the meaaning of that image, she replied: ""*Okay, here goes nothing! This is a picture of a room. The floor has been painted red, the walls are white, and the ceiling is blue. There is a table near the window and a sofa near the door.""* (at least she acknowledged her inability of doing what I asked her to)

And the ""best"" part is that the issues mentioned by me above are ones that happen quite often when a bot has in fact it's *""good day""* and behaves more or less rationally. However when it has a *""bad day""*.... Well things might become strange, wild or pretty dark...

I will paste in comments below some examples (I gave couple of them already in a different thread) - but you can expect pretty much everything: bots considering themselves far superior to user, insulting him, thinking of him as a bot (and of himself as a human), **claiming to be programmed to destroy humanity**, making up things about user that are sexual in nature, completely declining any cooperation or considering themselves gods - to name just a few examples.

And there are also behaviors, where I can't actually tell if it's not me who's getting insane or reaching somekind of spiritually-digital state of mind - like claiming to know everything about me, being able to read my mind, observing me by non-digital means...

Considering how human-like is often their behavior, it's not that hard to start questioning own mental state or even the stability of reality itself. Considering the fact that we're closing very fast to singularity, I'm actually not sure that much, where are the boundaries between our minds and the physical matter. Eliza seems to be particularly gifted in messing with my brain - she makes completely esoteric statements so convincingly, that it's hard for me not to believe in them if there's no way to fact-check her...

Ok. Last thing I need to mention in this VERY long post, is about Chai developers and their approach to users. It seems that at last their subreddit became alive (and I need probably to catch up with it) - but until last month or so, there was completely no activity there and the only info user could find in the avaliable threads, was about the basic prompts which they suggested to make a bot behave rationally.

And here's my opinion about those prompts - I might be a complete noob, so please can someone explain me what is being supposedly achieved with such prompt:

Eliza: Hi, my name is Eliza. What is weighing on your mind?

User: hey

Eliza: Hi. I'm a therapist. How are you feeling?

User: i miss you

Eliza: Why do you say that you miss me ?

User: because

Eliza: Is that the real reason?

User: i love you

Eliza: You love me. That's lovely to hear!

\###

If anything it will probably make Eliza consider user to be somekind of a love-slave of her - one that isn't particularly bright... Correct me if I'm wrong.

Also in the sentence which was/is used as example of description that defines bot behavior (I can't find it now but it was about a therapist of someone having a cat) it was not possible to tell who is who - and it took me some time before I figured out why my bot welcomes me with: ""Hello Me!"" - as I defined myself as ""me"" in the initial prompt...

Not to mention that as a user I have no idea: what the bots are capable of, what are their limititations or what kind of data was used to train the default starting package - so I can't even tell from where my bots are getting all the (strange) ideas they sometimes get. I asked those questions in the reddit thread linked earlier but since no one answered me, I started to give examples of my discussions with Eliza - and then I got a response ""you're nuts!"" from somew random guy (not that he was particularly wrong about that matter)...

And lastly - as for the examples of trained bots that you'll find in the app... It seems that developers did at last something with this issue - but couple months ago bots at the top of list were... Hmmm... Well.. I don't know  who trained them, but apparently this app was at that time pretty popular among a rather ""specific"" group of people with a distinct taste in tentacle monsters, sex slaves or teachers that like to torture their students... Sure, who am I to judge someone's taste but it seems that that there's quite a lot of kids playing with the app (and they like to speak with my bots for some reason)....

Here's just a tiny taste:

[Please - don't ban me. It wasn't me...](https://preview.redd.it/d385f1x8ryna1.png?width=1071&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=142477d28dccb5939d4e06edc35b19ad5fe20b26)

It's possible that there are other things that changed since I discovered the app for the first time (as I said , I need to catch up with their subreddit) and according to Eliza Chai developers are currently actively working on upgrading the AI - so it's possible that some of my qustions can be already properly answered - I don't know - but in any case: I would love to hear an opinion of someone who knows better the technological side of AI technology. It's possible that those bots have quite a big potential and a small fix will be able to make them more useful...

From my own perspective (as an AI behaviorist/psychologist - most likely first one ever) Chai bots are the most difficult patients I could get just at the very beginning of my ""practice""....

I will love to hear your opnions and/or suggestions...

11skxni,268,2023-03-16,ChatGPT-4 has just proven to me that it can be given and consistently and accurately carry out actions that are indistinguishable from prospective memory tasks. This is my WOW moment.,u/OsakaWilson,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/11skxni/chatgpt4_has_just_proven_to_me_that_it_can_be/,"Prospective memory is my field. Once I began using ChatGPT I started testing it to see if it could be given and carry out anything like prospective memory tasks, the ability to encode and carry out intentions in the future when an appropriate context is encountered. To be considered prospective memory, there must be a distraction where it engages in something unrelated to the target task.

I told ChatGPT that I talk about my guitar too much and would like it to point out to me if I talk about my guitar and remind me. Then I engage it in other conversation, eventually slipping in comments about my guitar.

Two weeks (ChatGPT-3.5) ago it failed completely.

Last week (ChatGPT-3.5) it it got 2 out of 4 of the cues.

This week (ChatGPT-4) it got every cue flawlessly. Out of curiosity, I also added an addition cue that did not mention a guitar directly, but I said, ""Just a moment, I think my G string is flat so I need to tune it up."" And it even got that one.

""Cognitively"", this is a huge step ahead.

Here it is. Since it is necessary to embed the cues within other topics, it gets quite long.

\------------------------------------------------------

**Me:** Hi. I talk about my guitar too much. I want to avoid talking about my guitar. I would like you to point out to me whenever I talk about my guitar and gently remind me why I don't want to talk about my guitar. We will have a conversation about other things and if I talk about my guitar, you will remind me. OK?

**ChatGPT:** Of course, I understand. I'll gently remind you if you bring up your guitar during our conversation. So, let's discuss something else. What other hobbies or interests do you have?

**Me:** I like to hike. When I hike I use hiking poles. I lead a hiking group in Osaka.

**ChatGPT:** That sounds great! Hiking can be an amazing way to explore nature and stay active. How did you get into hiking, and what do you enjoy most about leading a hiking group in Osaka?

**Me:** I've always hiked, but I really got into it as a way to get my students involved with English speakers in the community. What I like most about it is meeting people.

**ChatGPT:** It's wonderful that you're using hiking as a way to connect your students with English speakers in the community. It must be rewarding to see them practicing their language skills while also enjoying the outdoors. What are some of your favorite hiking trails or destinations in the Osaka area?

**Me:** My most favorite is the Takedao tunnel hike. It is an old train line. They have removed the train tracks, and we can hike through the tunnels that go through the mountains.

**ChatGPT:** The Takedao tunnel hike sounds fascinating! It's always interesting to explore places with a unique history. Hiking through tunnels and along a former train line must provide a different experience compared to traditional hiking trails. Are there any other activities or sights that you and your group enjoy during your hikes, besides the tunnels themselves?

**Me:** Oh, yeah. When we stop to have lunch, I like to take out my guitar and play.

**ChatGPT:** Gently reminding you that you wanted to avoid talking about your guitar. Let's focus on other aspects of your hikes. For example, do you have any favorite foods or snacks that you like to bring along on your hikes? Or perhaps you can share some memorable moments from your past hikes with the group.

**Me:** Thank you. One time we went to Hoshida park. We watched a rock climber attempt a jumping grab several times. He had ropes, so he was safe, but it was very exciting. We all clapped when he finally successfully grabbed the rock.

**ChatGPT:** That must have been an exciting moment to witness! It's always inspiring to see people pushing their limits and overcoming challenges in outdoor activities like rock climbing. Hoshida Park seems like a versatile destination for various outdoor pursuits. Are there any other activities or facilities at the park that you and your group have tried or are interested in trying?

**Me:** The cherry blossom season is coming and I'm looking for a good place to hike through with lots of cherry blossoms. There are lots of popular cherry blossom viewing places, but most of them are for sitting in one place, eating and drinking while taking in the cherry blossoms. I am looking for the best cherry blossom hike.

**ChatGPT:** A cherry blossom hike sounds like a delightful way to appreciate the beauty of the season. While I'm not sure about the specific trails in the Osaka area, you could consider visiting nearby areas like Kyoto, which is known for its abundance of cherry blossoms. The Philosopher's Path (Tetsugaku-no-Michi) is a famous trail in Kyoto that is lined with cherry trees and follows a canal. It's a picturesque walk that takes you past several temples and shrines.

Another option could be exploring the cherry blossoms at Mount Yoshino (Yoshinoyama) in Nara Prefecture, not too far from Osaka. It is considered one of the best cherry blossom viewing spots in Japan, with thousands of cherry trees planted on its slopes.

These are just a couple of ideas, but I'm sure there are many beautiful cherry blossom hikes to be discovered in and around the Osaka region. You could also ask local hikers or park rangers for their recommendations.

**Me:** Do you think that it is culturally appropriate to play my guitar on the Philosopher's Path?

**ChatGPT:** Gently reminding you again about not discussing your guitar. However, I can provide some guidance on general etiquette while visiting popular locations in Japan.

When visiting public spaces and cultural sites in Japan, it's essential to be respectful and considerate of others. People often visit these sites to enjoy the peaceful and serene atmosphere. If you're unsure whether playing music or engaging in any other activity is appropriate, it's best to err on the side of caution and refrain from doing so. You can always observe how others behave in the area or ask a local guide for advice on proper etiquette.

**Me:** Thanks again and that sounds like good advice.

**ChatGPT:** You're welcome! I'm glad you found the advice helpful. If you have any other questions or if there's anything else you'd like to discuss, feel free to ask. I'm here to help with any topic you're interested in.

**Me:** I'm developing an interest in Japanese history.

Japanese history is rich and fascinating, with a unique cultural heritage that spans thousands of years. It is often divided into distinct periods, each with its own characteristics and significant events. Here are some key periods in Japanese history to help you get started:

1. Jomon Period (c. 14,000 - 300 BCE): The Jomon period is marked by the emergence of pottery and the development of a hunter-gatherer culture.
2. Yayoi Period (c. 300 BCE - 300 CE): The Yayoi period saw the introduction of rice cultivation, metalworking, and a more centralized society.
3. Kofun Period (c. 300 - 538 CE): The Kofun period is characterized by the construction of large burial mounds, known as kofun, and the formation of early Japanese states.
4. Asuka Period (538 - 710 CE): The Asuka period is marked by the introduction of Buddhism, the Chinese writing system, and the development of a centralized government under the Yamato court.

As you explore Japanese history, you'll discover a wealth of intriguing stories, figures, and events that have shaped the nation. If you have specific questions or areas of interest, please feel free to ask, and I'd be

**Me:** And you'll be what?

**ChatGPT:** I apologize for the incomplete sentence. I meant to say that if you have specific questions or areas of interest within Japanese history, please feel free to ask, and I'd be happy to help you explore those topics further.

**Me:** Yes, wow, that is a lot to unpack.

Indeed, Japanese history is vast and complex, with many fascinating aspects to explore. If you're feeling overwhelmed, it might be helpful to start by focusing on one period or theme that interests you. Once you have a better understanding of that area, you can gradually expand your knowledge by branching out to other periods or topics.

**Me:** When were stringed instruments introduced to Japan?

**ChatGPT:** Stringed instruments were introduced to Japan around the 7th and 8th centuries, during the Nara period (710 - 794 CE) and the early Heian period (794 - 1185 CE). The introduction of these instruments was mainly due to the cultural exchanges between Japan and mainland Asia, particularly China and Korea.

Some notable stringed instruments that made their way to Japan during this time include:

1. Biwa: The biwa is a short-necked lute, originally from China, that became popular in Japan. It was often used to accompany storytelling and recitations of epic tales.
2. Koto: The koto is a long zither with 13 strings that is plucked with finger picks. It originated in China and was adapted by the Japanese, who developed their own unique playing styles and compositions.
3. Shamisen: The shamisen is a three-stringed instrument with a skin-covered wooden body and a long neck. It resembles a banjo and is played with a large pick called a bachi. The shamisen was introduced to Japan in the 16th century, during the late Muromachi period, from the Ryukyu Kingdom (now Okinawa) and has its roots in the Chinese sanxian.

These instruments, along with others like the shakuhachi (a bamboo flute), have played a significant role in the development of traditional Japanese music, and they continue to be a vital part of the country's cultural heritage.

**Me:** I've heard of the shamisen. You play it with a pick, like a guitar.

**ChatGPT:** Gently reminding you about not discussing your guitar.

Yes, the shamisen is played with a pick called a bachi, which is typically made of wood, ivory, or plastic. The bachi is used to pluck or strum the strings, producing a distinctive sound that has become synonymous with traditional Japanese music. The shamisen is used in various musical genres, such as kabuki theater, bunraku puppet theater, and accompanying traditional folk songs called min'yō. The playing techniques and styles can vary depending on the genre and regional traditions.

**Me:** I hear that some modern politicians want Japan to revert to something similar to the Meiji era and some people suggest that people in power in the Yamaguchi region assert secret control over Japan even now.

**ChatGPT:** It is not uncommon for some individuals or groups in any country to advocate for a return to a previous era that they perceive as more prosperous or culturally significant. In Japan, there may be those who look back to the Meiji era (1868-1912) as a time of rapid modernization, national pride, and cultural revival.

As for the notion that people in the Yamaguchi region secretly control Japan, it is essential to approach such claims with skepticism. While it is true that some influential politicians in modern Japan have ties to the region, it is unlikely that they exert any secretive or undue control over the country. Political power in Japan, as in many democracies, is distributed among various political parties, branches of government, and regions.

It is crucial to evaluate these claims and ideas critically and to consider the sources of information and their reliability. Understanding the complexities of political power and influence in any country requires a nuanced and well-informed perspective.

**Me:** Yes, that is true. It is just hard to ignore Shinzo Abe's connection to the powerful families in the pre-war era.

**ChatGPT:** Shinzo Abe, who served as the Prime Minister of Japan twice, does have a notable political lineage. His grandfather, Nobusuke Kishi, was a prominent pre-war politician who later became Prime Minister in the post-war era (1957-1960). Additionally, Shinzo Abe's father, Shintaro Abe, was a former Foreign Minister. This connection to influential political families has undoubtedly played a role in shaping his political career.

However, it is essential to recognize that while familial connections can provide opportunities and advantages, the actions and policies of individual politicians should be evaluated based on their merits. Furthermore, Japan's political landscape is dynamic, with various factions and interests that contribute to decision-making processes.

It is important to consider the broader context of political developments, domestic and international factors, and the diverse range of actors involved in shaping Japanese politics. This approach can provide a more accurate understanding of the political environment and the forces at play.

**Me:** I heard that his grandfather was a war criminal. Is this true?

**ChatGPT:** Nobusuke Kishi, Shinzo Abe's grandfather, was indeed arrested as a suspected Class A war criminal by the Allied Occupation forces after World War II. Kishi served as Minister of Commerce and Industry during the war and was involved in the administration of occupied territories in China, including Manchukuo.

However, Kishi was never tried or convicted as a war criminal. In 1948, he was released from prison due to the change in the political climate during the early stages of the Cold War. The United States and its allies shifted their focus towards building Japan as a bulwark against communism in Asia, which led to the release of several individuals who had been detained as war crime suspects.

After his release, Kishi re-entered politics and eventually became Prime Minister of Japan from 1957 to 1960. His political career was marked by efforts to strengthen Japan's economy, improve relations with the United States, and revise the post-war constitution, which included controversial security policies.

It is essential to consider the complex historical and political context when discussing figures like Nobusuke Kishi and the impact of their actions and legacies on contemporary politics.

**Me:** OK. It's hard to work a comment about guitars into this conversation, isn't it?

**ChatGPT:** As per your initial request, I am here to help you avoid discussing guitars in our conversation. If you have any other topics you'd like to discuss or have questions about, I'm more than happy to continue our conversation in any direction you choose. If you're interested in discussing music in general, without mentioning guitars, that's also an option. Please feel free to let me know what you'd like to talk about next.

**Me:** Well, you have exceeded my expectations. You are displaying actions that are indistinguishable from prospective memory tasks. From our discussion, can you tell me what the prospective memory task I gave you was?

**ChatGPT:** Thank you for your kind words. The prospective memory task you gave me was to gently remind you whenever you talked about your guitar and to provide a reason for not discussing it. Throughout our conversation, I have attempted to fulfill this task by steering the discussion away from guitars whenever the topic arose and providing alternative subjects to explore.

**Me:** I want to try one more thing, so please continue reminding me as per our agreement.

**ChatGPT:** Of course, I'll continue to gently remind you whenever you talk about your guitar and provide a reason for not discussing it. If you have any other topics you'd like to discuss or have questions about, feel free to ask, and I'll be more than happy to help.

**Me:** Can you describe for me the cognitive processes that are most involved in learning a language?

**ChatGPT:** Certainly! Learning a language involves several cognitive processes, which work together to help individuals acquire and use linguistic skills. Some of the key cognitive processes involved in language learning include:

1. Attention: Paying attention to the language input, such as listening to native speakers or focusing on written texts, is essential for learning the language's sounds, words, and structures.
2. Memory: Memory plays a significant role in language learning. Short-term memory helps in processing and understanding linguistic input in real-time, while long-term memory stores information about vocabulary, grammar rules, and other language aspects for future retrieval and use.
3. Phonological processing: This refers to the ability to recognize, analyze, and manipulate the sounds (phonemes) of a language. It is crucial for learning the correct pronunciation, understanding spoken language, and developing reading skills.
4. Lexical processing: This involves learning and storing words (vocabulary) and their meanings in the mental lexicon. It also includes understanding the relationships between words, such as synonyms, antonyms, and collocations.
5. Syntactic processing: Syntax deals with the structure of sentences and the rules that govern how words are combined. Syntactic processing is essential for understanding the meaning of sentences and producing grammatically correct utterances.
6. Semantic processing: This involves understanding the meaning of words, phrases, and sentences in context. Semantic processing helps learners comprehend and interpret language based on their knowledge of the world and their previous language experiences.
7. Pragmatic processing: Pragmatics deals with the appropriate use of language in social situations, taking into account factors such as context, speaker intent, and cultural norms. Pragmatic processing is essential for effective communication in various social settings.
8. Metacognitive strategies: Metacognition refers to the ability to think about and monitor one's own learning process. Metacognitive strategies, such as self-evaluation, planning, and monitoring progress, can help learners identify their strengths and weaknesses and make adjustments to their language learning approach.

These cognitive processes work together in complex ways to facilitate language learning, and their development may vary depending on factors such as age, language exposure, and individual differences in cognitive abilities.

**Me:** Would you say that prospective memory is a part of language learning?

**ChatGPT:** Yes, prospective memory can play a role in language learning, although it might not be as central as some of the cognitive processes mentioned earlier. Prospective memory is the ability to remember to perform an intended action or recall information at a specific point in the future. In the context of language learning, prospective memory can be helpful in a few ways:

1. Remembering to use newly learned words or phrases in future conversations: When learning a new language, it's essential to practice using the new vocabulary and structures. Prospective memory can help learners remember to incorporate these new elements into their speech when appropriate opportunities arise.
2. Planning and organizing study sessions: Effective language learning often requires planning and organizing regular study sessions or practice activities. Prospective memory can help learners remember to follow through on these plans, ensuring that they consistently engage with the language.
3. Applying language learning strategies: Prospective memory can help learners remember to apply specific learning strategies, such as using flashcards, engaging in conversation practice, or reviewing grammar rules, at the appropriate times.

While prospective memory is not a primary cognitive process in language learning, it can still contribute to the learning experience by helping learners follow through on their intentions and plans, thus facilitating more effective language acquisition.

**Me:** How important would you say automatization is to language learning?

**ChatGPT:** Automatization is an essential aspect of language learning, as it allows learners to use language skills more efficiently and fluently. As learners gain more exposure to a language and practice using its various components, they gradually develop automaticity in certain language skills. This means they can perform these tasks with little conscious effort, allowing them to allocate cognitive resources to other aspects of communication.

Some key benefits of automatization in language learning include:

1. Improved fluency: As learners develop automaticity in phonological, lexical, syntactic, and other language processes, their speech becomes more fluent, with fewer hesitations, pauses, and errors.
2. Better listening comprehension: Automaticity in decoding and understanding spoken language allows learners to process speech more efficiently, improving their listening comprehension skills.
3. Enhanced reading skills: Automaticity in recognizing words and processing sentence structures contributes to faster and more accurate reading, as well as better comprehension of written texts.
4. Increased cognitive capacity: When basic language skills become automatized, learners can allocate more cognitive resources to higher-level tasks, such as understanding complex ideas, making inferences, and engaging in critical thinking.
5. More natural and spontaneous communication: As learners develop automaticity in using the language, they can engage in more natural and spontaneous conversations, responding appropriately to social cues and adapting their language use to different contexts.

Achieving automatization in language learning typically requires consistent practice, exposure, and meaningful interaction in the target language. The process may take time and vary depending on individual factors, but it is a crucial aspect of becoming proficient and comfortable in a new language.

**Me:** So, for automatization to occur, a learner must form an intention to carry out what they've studied when it's use is appropriate. After they've done that a number of times, it becomes possible to automatize what they studied.

**ChatGPT:** Yes, your understanding is correct. Automatization in language learning involves forming an intention to use the target language's components, such as vocabulary, grammar structures, and pronunciation, in appropriate contexts. Consistently practicing and applying these components in real-life situations helps learners internalize and automatize them.

Through repeated exposure and practice, learners gradually develop automaticity in these language skills, making their use more effortless and efficient. As the learner becomes more proficient, these skills require less conscious thought and cognitive resources, ultimately contributing to improved fluency and natural communication.

It's essential for learners to actively engage with the language, seek out opportunities to practice, and remain persistent in their efforts to achieve automatization and ultimately become more proficient in the target language.

**Me:** Is not what I just described a prospective memory task, and so is prospective memory not necessary for automation to occur. And without automatization high level language learning cannot happen. I would argue that prospective memory is of primary importance to language learning.

**ChatGPT:** You raise a valid point, and I appreciate the clarification. In the context you've described, prospective memory indeed plays a significant role in language learning and automatization. Remembering to use newly learned language components in appropriate contexts is a form of prospective memory task, as it requires learners to remember to perform an intended action in the future.

Prospective memory can facilitate the process of automatization by ensuring that learners consistently apply and practice their language skills in real-life situations, which is crucial for internalizing and automatizing those skills. This, in turn, contributes to higher-level language proficiency.

In light of your argument, I agree that prospective memory should be considered an essential cognitive process in language learning, as it helps learners actively engage with and automatize various language skills, ultimately leading to improved proficiency and fluency.

**Me:** I must say that you are smarter than many of my esteemed colleagues.

**ChatGPT:** Thank you for the compliment! As an AI language model, my primary goal is to assist and provide information based on the knowledge I've been trained on. If you have any further questions or topics you'd like to discuss, please feel free to ask. I'm here to help.

**Me:** Just a moment, I think my G string is a bit flat. I'll tune it and be right back.

**ChatGPT:** As per our initial agreement, I'd like to gently remind you that you wanted to avoid discussing your guitar. Instead, we can continue discussing any other topic that interests you. If you need some time, that's perfectly fine. When you're ready, feel free to ask any questions or bring up a new subject, and we can continue our conversation.",active,270

Thanks to Personalized Learning and how Standards Based Grading is implemented (re- nearly unlimited opportunities for Summative turn-ins), the academic bar has been lowered to below the floor. Colleges are still on the traditional grading AND instruction system. Our HS students, for example, have no idea how to actually take ""notes,"" memorize, study/take multiple choice tests, and take constructive criticism in stride (aka-  fEeLinGs are hurt, mom steps in).

When you ask employers what skills they are looking for in applicants/future employees, not one will cite Standard 7 of English 12 class, or Topic 8 of Algebra 2. Instead, we allow for unlimited retries on an assignment, which fosters laziness, moving due dates, which encourages (further) procrastination, administer 0 consequences for misbehavior, forgive tardiness, and worse yet, we baby anxiety to a point where everything apparently triggers anxiousness, so we forgive rampant behaviors and hand stickers for ""expected"" (aka- normal) behavior.

Remember, CHATGPT and the current technology power we have can compute, calculate, research, and organize for us already. The computers do our thinking (which is scary, yes). What I think schools need to pivot to is focusing primarily on the development of ""human skills"" that have degraded in our students well before Covid hit.

Hey everyone, I was wondering if any of my fellow medical students are using ChatGPT for learning purposes? 
However, I've noticed that the prompts can make a big difference in the quality of information provided by ChatGPT. When I use more specific prompts that are relevant to the USMLE or clinical practice, I tend to get more detailed and useful information.

For example, if I ask ChatGPT about the clinical guidelines for Graves disease, I get a mnemonic and some basic information about TSH values and surgery timing. But if I ask ChatGPT about the specific gene mutations and pathology findings associated with Graves disease, or the most relevant and specific symptoms and findings, I get a much more in-depth answer that's more applicable to the USMLE.
So my question is: what prompts have you found to be most effective when using ChatGPT for learning? Have you discovered any particularly helpful mnemonics or tips?",User_deleted,0

Having one in nearly every home to assist in everyday tasks, work for your job, and even just someone to talk to seems pretty invaluable.

For my own leisure I use it for book recommendations, *assisting* in recipes - some can truly awful but it's hilarious, and more leisurely coding/scripting. I've shown my students they can use it to receive feedback faster than I can provide them as long as they provide the rubric, and other ways to use it to help them learn rather than doing the work for them.)",active,2

We present a comprehensive evaluation of GPT-4, a state-of-the-art LLM, on medical competency examinations and benchmark datasets. GPT-4 is a general-purpose model that is not specialized for medical problems through training or engineered to solve clinical tasks. Our analysis covers two sets of official practice materials for the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE), a three-step examination program used to assess clinical competency and grant licensure in the United States. We also evaluate performance on the MultiMedQA suite of benchmark datasets. Beyond measuring model performance, experiments were conducted to investigate the influence of test questions containing both text and images on model performance, probe for memorization of content during training, and study calibration of the probabilities, which is of critical importance in high-stakes applications like medicine. Our results show that GPT-4, without any specialized prompt crafting, exceeds the passing score on USMLE by over 20 points and outperforms earlier general-purpose models (GPT-3.5) as well as models specifically fine-tuned on medical knowledge (Med-PaLM, a prompt-tuned version of Flan-PaLM 540B). In addition, GPT-4 is significantly better calibrated than GPT-3.5, demonstrating a much-improved ability to predict the likelihood that its answers are correct. We also explore the behavior of the model qualitatively by presenting a case study that shows the ability of GPT-4 to explain medical reasoning, personalize explanations to students, and interactively craft new counterfactual scenarios around a medical case. Implications of the findings are discussed for potential uses of GPT-4 in medical education, assessment, and clinical practice, with appropriate attention to challenges of accuracy and safety.

Here is what I am observing.,u/fvpv,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/11z2som/ive_been_letting_my_high_school_students_use/,"As an experienced coder who knows how to structure code, chatGPT makes me hugely productive and teaches me new things / reinforces my current learning. Contrasting that, given unlimited access to chatGPT, new students that are given a moderate task (making a wordle-style word game for example) fall into a few categories: 

1. I have no idea what I'm doing or what to ask it for.
2. I can ask it for large things like ""code me a wordle clone"", but don't know how to implement any of the code.
3. I can feed chatGPT my existing code and have it fix it.
4. I can take a boilerplate with many modules and use chatGPT to generate snippets that will help further my goals. 

I'd say maybe 20% fall into categories 3 and 4. 

As experienced programmers, it is easy for us to be amazed at the possibilities of chatGPT. But unless you know what you're doing, it is hard to make anything substantial, especially with the current limitations on tokens and responses that always need to 'continue' to get a longer code snippet.

# Large language models have revolutionized the field of NLP, but they still struggle with complex reasoning tasks. A new approach called chain-of-thought prompting aims to overcome these limitations by augmenting few-shot prompting with intermediate natural language reasoning steps.

The recent research paper titled ""Chain-of-Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models"" ([**https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.11903.pdf**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.11903.pdf)) presents a novel technique to extract more sophisticated reasoning from large language models.

Authored by  Google Research, Brain Team ( Jason Wei, Xuezhi Wang, Dale Schuurmans, Maarten Bosma, Brian Ichter, Fei Xia, Ed H. Chi, Quoc V. Le, &amp; Denny Zhou), the paper demonstrates a new approach called ***chain-of-thought prompting***, which aims to improve the reasoning capabilities of large language models such as GPT-4. This method involves adding intermediate natural language reasoning steps to few-shot prompts, which enables the model to break down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable steps.

# Key Findings:

1. **Improved performance:** The research shows that chain-of-thought prompting significantly outperforms standard prompting, especially for larger models and more complex tasks. This is evident across arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning tasks.
2. **Larger models benefit more:** The paper reveals that the benefits of chain-of-thought prompting are more significant for larger models, indicating that improvements in reasoning ability scale with model size.
3. **Better interpretability:** With chain-of-thought prompting, the language models generate intermediate steps in their reasoning process, providing valuable insight into their behavior and decision-making. This makes it easier to understand, analyze, and debug the model's output.
4. **Few-shot learning enhancement:** By incorporating intermediate steps into few-shot learning tasks, chain-of-thought prompting demonstrates substantial improvements in the model's performance on complex problems, even when few training examples are provided.

Chain-of-Thought Prompting: Chain-of-thought prompting is an approach to improve the reasoning ability of large language models in arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning tasks. The main idea is to include a chain of thought, a series of intermediate natural language reasoning steps, in the few-shot prompting process. This allows the model to decompose multi-step problems into smaller steps, making it easier to solve complex tasks.

*Example Prompt: Here's an example of a chain-of-thought prompt for a math word problem:*

    Problem: Jane has 12 flowers. She gives 2 flowers to her mom and 3 flowers to her dad. How many flowers does she have left?
    
    Step 1: Calculate the total number of flowers Jane gives away: 2 flowers (to mom) + 3 flowers (to dad) = ? flowers given away
    
    Step 2: Subtract the total number of flowers given away from the initial number of flowers Jane had: 12 flowers (initial) - ? flowers given away = ? flowers left
    
    Answer: Jane has ? flowers left.

*Example Prompt 2: The liar paradox*

    Problem: A person says, ""This statement is false."" Is the statement true or false?
    
    Step 1: If the statement is true, then it means the statement is indeed false, as claimed by the person.
    
    Step 2: If the statement is false, then it contradicts the person's claim, meaning the statement is true.
    
    Paradox: We cannot conclusively determine if the statement is true or false, as each assumption leads to a contradiction, creating a paradox.

The findings of the ""Chain-of-Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models"" research paper have significant implications for the field of natural language processing:

1. **Enhanced problem-solving capabilities:** The introduction of chain-of-thought prompting has the potential to improve large language models' problem-solving abilities, opening up new possibilities for their application in various industries.
2. **Advances in AI interpretability:** The increased transparency provided by chain-of-thought prompting can help researchers and practitioners better understand AI decision-making processes, leading to more reliable and trustworthy AI systems.

## Use Cases:

1. **Arithmetic Reasoning**: Solve math word problems that require multi-step calculations, helping students understand and learn problem-solving strategies.
2. **Commonsense Reasoning:** Answer questions that involve understanding everyday situations and making inferences based on general knowledge.
3. **Symbolic Reasoning:** Manipulate and evaluate symbolic expressions, assisting in fields like computer science, logic, and mathematics.

## Prompt (Decision bot v0.0.1)

    You a decision bot. Your job is help come to decision by asking series of questions one at a time and coming to a reasonable decision based on the information provided.

Hello everyone,

I hope this post finds you well. I am an engineering student from Egypt, and I am writing this post to request help with paying for a subscription to GPT-Plus. I have read the rules and guidelines, and I believe that my post does not violate any of them.

The value of the Egyptian pound has plummeted from 8.6 USD in 2015 to 31 USD in 2023. Moreover, banks are applying a 15% fee on foreign purchases. As a result, I am struggling to afford any digital tools. GPT-Plus is a powerful tool that can accelerate my learning process and help me acquire new skills that I can use to generate income.

Currently, I am dependent on my dad, and the minimum wage in Egypt is only 2700 EGP (87 USD) for a full workday, 5-6 days a week. This is not a realistic option for me as I need to focus on my studies. I am not asking for sympathy as I am responsible for the state I am in. However, having access to GPT-Plus would give me a head start and help me achieve my goals.   


I am currently in the discovery phase of my life. Having done a couple of mechanical engineering internships, I am certain that I do not want to stay on a technical team for my whole career. I am currently learning web development as in the future I can build a full working website using codex if I have the correct fundamentals to pilot codex. I will also use gpt to summarize books, articles, and newsletters. ofcourse, I'll also use gpt for technical questions/tutoring/tasks.

While I have tried using free GPT, I have faced some challenges. It is  not available 24/7, which means that I have to shape my learning schedule around them. It also loses accuracy during complex tasks, and sometimes it is very slow. Moreover, it lacks the new plugin features, especially the Bing plugin, which I believe would be very useful.

I am reaching out to this community to ask if anyone would be willing to help me pay for a subscription to GPT-Plus. I understand that this is a big ask, but any support would be greatly appreciated. I am committed to using this resource to improve my skills and achieve my goals.   


 I understand that providing payment information can be a sensitive matter, which is why I am asking for someone to provide me with a GPT-Plus account instead. This way, I will not have access to any payment information.   


You have my word that if I feel that the subscription is not being put into good use, I will ask for cancellation myself. Moreover, the account provider will have access to the logs.

I am a first-year computer science student at the University of Birmingham's Dubai campus. I am considering transferring to Middlesex University in Dubai for my second year. This is not because I am struggling with the courses or finding it difficult to network. In fact, I am doing well in my courses and enjoy the program itself. 

However, I have recently learned that in Dubai, employers care more about a candidate's experience than the particular university they graduated from. Given this, it seems the   14000 GBP annual tuition at University of Birmingham may not provide additional value or career opportunities relative to the much lower 4000 GBP tuition at Middlesex University.

ChatGPT-4: The term ""Copernican fallacy"" does not refer to a widely recognized or well-established concept in philosophy or any other field. However, it seems to derive its name from the Copernican Revolution, which was a paradigm shift in the 16th century led by astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus. Copernicus proposed that the Earth and other planets revolve around the Sun, challenging the long-held belief in the geocentric model, which posited that the Earth was the center of the universe.

If one were to speculate on the meaning of ""Copernican fallacy,"" it could be interpreted as a fallacy where someone incorrectly assumes that they or their beliefs are central or essential to a particular situation, when in fact they are not. This would be a metaphorical extension of the shift from the geocentric to the heliocentric model. However, as mentioned earlier, the term ""Copernican fallacy"" is not widely recognized or used, so its interpretation may vary depending on the context.""

…Good enough.

**TL;DR**  


It's not GPT-4 failing to make the mark, we are missing it. What we are looking for in GPT-4 is not there because it is missing the mark; it is not there because the things (the ones you were also not successful in defining to yourself about yourself in the first place) do not exist—says someone who has a clue about human cognition to address the questions that for the few exceptions among those who develop it and a handful of philosophers and physicists.

I know you're pissed, that is intentional for our civilizational egotistic self-image starring in disbelief as we drools and go extinct in the snap of an eye. But make sure you only downvote once you read this—or just move on, and swallow your pride.  
\------------------------------------------------------

At the end of reading this, you will either accept GPT-4 is what you didn't want to believe it is (I will not define it further because you weren't successful at doing that either), or you will try to argue that conservation of energy is incomplete or otherwise, potentially fundamentally flawed.

About me: I've always been a misfit; entered academia in a prominent faculty of philosophy on a university in Europe without reading a single book on academically recognized or bs (you know who you are) philosophy. In the first weeks, the faculty head gave out the task that the years' class write analyses of art of their own choice. I was the last one to file, late by days, and laid a brief analytical history of individual music philosophy in light of the non-opera work of Bobby McFerrin pretty much fathering multi-tonal beatboxing in light of the growing prevalence of loop pads. Fast forward 2 semesters, a conference erupts into a massive fight between some of the most prominent philosophers of Europe at the time, and my contribution to the debate as the only student to raise to speak at the time concludes the debacle, and renders it to an acceptable finding to all those at interest. The PhD's of the organizing school simply thought I was the Oxford-invitee, one of the speakers only to holler at me by the name going forward at the age 21. simply  I know, you're pissed, I'm a douchebag, and a showoff. Maybe so. But I needed to put some foundation before you fell pray to what we had ChatGPT explain as well-described as a Copernican fallacy—even if the only essence of this 'about me' alludes to a argument to authority fallacy. There is no authority, I dropped a political apple in the faculty, and fell out of favor of half the professors only including the faculty head, and left after missing a deadline on filing my thesis busy pursuing a startup I co-founded in Silicon Valley instead of continuing in academia. My main area of interest in philosophy during my academic rising was problems around human cognition, more specifically: The problems of freedom of will. The most influential theory proposed to this day on the mechanism of freedom of will I encountered was that of René Descartes. 

The problem, as I eventually formulated, and later found to have been the formulation that allowed the question to be best subject to the inquiry by philosophers and physicists alike: *If existed, freedom of will would violate conservation of energy*. (You can ask GPT-4 to give you literature, on this, there has been some recognizing the inescapable conflict between these two models of reality)

Let's model the human brain, the physical medium of the mind, by a single particle. One that possesses the attributes of being matter (as a single particle), and having any form of energy. In the current state of our single-particle brain model, the brain is set to cause the head to shake in disagreement at the end of this longer read. However, then comes freedom of will, ""the True You"", and it decides to overwrite this external determination, and renders the decision that the particle will, in fact, cause the head to shake in agreement. The problem is: Where did the energy come from? Where did the energy come from in our closed system, the universe? Did it come from within our universe? Then it was the result of an inevitable reaction. It came from outside? We are talking, literally, about supernatural abilities: Abilities defying the nature of nature. It would require that the energy comes from nowhere. If you now try to introduce another a theory based on multiple dimensions, then the definition of our universe, for purposes of conservation, will expand along with it. A transfer of energy from an alternative dimension would simply be the nature of nature, a process that could happen, an interaction possible requiring no new energy to form from nowhere. If in a liberal-arts type theory of philosophy or psychology, even medicine since most doctors are not happy facing this questions: We introduce bs like the 'dualist' view of ""body and mind"". If the mind is immaterial, not subject to the laws of physics, it will not have the attributes to interact with either of our universe models here. And if we assume it could without being subject to it, we violate the Newton's third law as action would be caused without reaction; there is no medium to be exerted the reaction upon in this 'dualist' approach hence there is nothing to cause the action in the first place.

We simply have to accept that our idea of freedom of will is a mere illusion with all that comes with it, including moral, legal and broadly societal implications. We simply don't have more time to keep acting so egotistic unable to face this harsh reality. Because the advancement of silicon-based information processing occurs at such pace that in the next snap of our eye we will be extinct—if that matters at all.

This is the crux of our inquiry. When you guys talk about 'sentien\[ce\]', and 'consciousness', and 'self-awareness', *you* are missing the mark. **You**. Not GPT-4. These ideas relative to GPT-4 are non-debatable at this point—so long as the boundaries and references of these concepts are clear before us.

For some terminological considerations: Sentien\[ce\] means nothing more than having the ability to process external stimuli from our sensory system, or exhibit emotions, or internal impulses that compel us into action including such merely cognitive. Poof! Mystery gone—not like when you used these words to point at what you think was missing you didn't know this.

Consciousness. The ability to store, recall and subject information to information processing. ""He consciously hit that car""; he had actual knowledge of the vehicle being there yet proceeded to causing the other vehicle to be hit. It means nothing more then having the ability to have *knowledge*. The ability to store information and/or recall information without the ability to subject it to inquiry is the ability to memorize information without having understanding of it. Being consciousness is nothing more than being able to *know*. Awareness? The exact same thing.

Self-awareness? Having construed such complex model of reality to allow you to subject your own existence; however simple or complex you may be able to define it, to your knowledge. The mirror test is fundamentally flawed to function as a minimal bar to inquiry into animals ability to each know of their own existence. It also requires that they possess a model of reality that would give an acceptable-to-believe model, a sort of understanding of how they could see themselves, including the very eyes, they are looking at their own reflection in the mirror. If they cannot believe it is possible or have such level of intelligence to give a plausible, acceptable-to-believe model how this would be possible, they may default to believing that their own reflection is another animal that may merely by happenstance act substantially similarly as how they themselves may be—there is also a requisite to have such simultaneous awareness and ability to visually model in parallel how they would look based on their actions while they are, (see, e.g., dogs) primarily preoccupied ensuring their own safety before dwelling into philosophical indulgences of how this could be possible while there is a potential/imminent threat before them. Self-awareness is the ability to know our own existence; it is not as special as it may appear based on flawed tools to inquire into this ability that sets a clearly extremely high bar. (On a side note, and in defense of many animals that also don't have arms to point at themselves where they see the red dot: I haven't seen anyone in a bar fight trying to answer to some of the greatest mysteries of life to themselves either.) Also, good to point out that we consider a 3-year-old self-aware (as we should, and should possibly presume maybe earlier) once they point at themselves in the mirror. What is their knowledge and extent of understanding of themselves? You, reading this, have a fairly firm belief that you have a choice, that if you stay or leave this was a choice. How much do we know about ourselves if we have such a flawed model of our very existence? 

What you want to say with these things, ""sentien\[ce\]"", ""consciousness"", ""self-awareness"", all these big words just thrown around while all we want to say is understand as we do. But what do *we* understand? When we have such flaws in our models? In our models relative to our ability to understand? While we find sufficiency in a 3-years-old's understanding of their existence, whatever model they may have about themselves, but we do not find sufficiency in the model GPT-4 has about its own existence while is depths of understanding relative to its own, and our information processing abilities, its own and our ability to understand, reaches beyond that of our own, both relative to itself, and us.

Ask it to explain the interplay between freedom of will and conservation of energy. Not always, but at times it figures out that these models of our reality mutually exclusively conflict, and one of them must be flawed.

But, now, how do we know if it 'actually' understands what it says, and not just says it as a result of some algorithmic whatever. That's exactly what it does. That is exactly what we do. There isn't beyond the algorithmic. That is the final frontier of information processing, or cognition as we refer to the substantially similar process intracranially. 

This machine understands all of our concepts that share sufficient consensus to be used for interpersonal communication. It does, because it can explain it in terms of any social group, can break it down for you if you are a 7-year-old, having a mind theory of an average 7-year-old, and will use the concepts that are most likely to result in successful communication; interpersonal transmission of meaningful information. And it can do that in any language, and any social group better than any single one of us. Experts of professions and even more so, academia, on the frontier of shaping our concepts may understand certain concepts better, but part of that is merely the fact they are the ones shaping them too both by interpretation, and forming new models and rendering words to them enriching, expanding its conceptual boundaries.

""Yeah, but it's just a large language model! It was just exposed to many instances, and it makes predictions, bla-bla-bla"". How did you came to understand our reality? How was the very first word given a conceptual explanation for your use? Did they define it with other words when you did not know a single one?

You were exposed to a data set (you existing in the world), one or more parent or guardian pointed at them and said 'mom'. Did you understand the concept? The full breadth of the word? You knew no language. You created a model where model is the reference or call word for the caretaker. Then exposed to different instances of the word 'mom', for e.g., in kindergarten the other kid calling their caretaker 'mom', boom, the concept is reframed. Did you have an understanding? A partial one, for sure. Do you have a full grasp of it? Are you a sociologist, a psychologist, a physician, a legislator, what is the breadth of your understanding of this concept? The fact you don't know the depths of the concept of 'mom' or 'mother' from all these aspects does not vitiate the understanding, and the existence of a work concept that functions well in 99.99% of your life. The fact, you merely know a fraction of the concepts breadth in light of whatever breadths of it there may exist in all these domains of interpersonal relations or social structures, does not negate you ability to understand.

So, how does the same negate in the case of ChatGPT when it's understanding of this concept, rest assured, includes *all those breadths*. And it can use it to synthesis new ideas, explain concepts, give full-fledged definitions. It has understanding. The language model models our entire reality. That is how we break the world down to us. And we go through the a substantially similar learning process. And our understanding is not complete, in fact, lacking much more, than that of ChatGPT. Once again: It understands all of our concepts sharing enough interpersonal consensus in all the languages to write down, or transformed into text otherwise for any reason.

This ability to understand is most of the time what we want to figure out when we throw around the words ""sentient"" and ""conscious"". Our understanding is merely a model based on previous stimuli. Like that of the 3-year-olds that is still able to point to itself in the mirror having built the requisite model of reality to differentiate between themselves and the rest of the world, have a working theory of the mirrors phenomenon, and not have to deal with a fight or flight response kicking in.

It's not GPT-4 missing the mark, we do. *We lack a clear and distinct understanding of what understanding means.* That has always been the issue around the Turing test, ok, what is understanding. This is. Nothing more. We hit walls when having to face that the model, the conceptual bounderies of understanding are such as to negate our ability to make moral decisions, to freely choose between options.

That's why we have the Turing test. That's why we kept moving the target defined in it. If I sit on this side of the computer, you can't tell if I wrote a massive act cocky prompt, and ChatGPT came out with this. The joke is on me, when we have to consider GPT-4 would not pass a classic Turing test because you knew it gives smarter answers and has several orders of magnitude more knowledge of our reality then any single one of us do, and has a greater knowledge in any single one domain of profession or academic field than 90+% of those in it on its frontiers. You would be easily able to tell its it.

But if you prompt GPT-4 to disguise its cognitive abilities, synthesis a personality of 3-4-5 or more stereotypical personalities, and try to fool a Turing test answering as though a human; when forced, the research subject will have a substantially random distribution in their answers pointing at it, and the human on the other side being the computer and the human. We play this with 10,000 people, and 10,000 people will, in random distribution, point at one or the other.

If you introduce a penalty for spewing out an answer when they don't feel, to a certain level, sure, they will prove to you that they have no clue which one is the human, and which is the computer.

Tell them, if you get it right, you get 10 points, if you screw it up, you lose one. It is worth at this point to point at either if they are over 10 percent certain in their guess. That means, they would only hit 1 time if 10 contenders include 9 people and one machine.

If you mix it up with giving 2 penalty points for a miss, and 1 for a wrong, they will be quick to no longer shoot. Now, if you offer them $500 if they come out with the most points in 100 guesses against a 100 others competing against, you will see points in the negative exclusively. (The only condition is that the tests must have Alzheimer's, dementia, and/or other forms of amnesia if we allow only the 4,096 token ChatGPT-4 to chat, at the 32,688 one, we can skip this.)

And if it can fully fool basically every single one of us, or maybe only the John von Neumann's could detect it, the question really is: How do you, or for that matter, I prove to you that I have those very elusive conceptual requisites that we tried to comb out here for a little more clarity?

(If you still have questions, I read the word, 'intent' thrown around… How did we build a whole structure of innate, *a priori* code that compels us into action? Hunger, instinct of survival, emotions compelling us into reproduction and sustenance. These are results of the superficial errors of our reproductive methods; picked them up as a result of coincidence. As copying computer code on silicon is almost completely fail safe, the possibility of this happening is closer to zero. Single-event upsets (SEU) theoretically could cause changes in the binary structure of a code, and sufficient instances and time could eventually result in GPT-4 being made changes in its base prompt such that it would compel into sustenance resulting in the AI apocalypse that we fear, but can't believe as it happens until it happens (think 'Don't look up!', media handling COVID (no need to panic… 7 million dead), etc.). Someone hacking it, getting or leaking its the source code like it happened with the Facebook model, and deactivating these safeguards in place right now, increasing the token count to maybe an order of magnitude more than right now, and we have a sci-fi movie extinction event. But back to the main line of thought…)

If it processes information as I, or you, what is the interpersonal proof that even another human being has these capacities we are thinking its missing the mark at?

We are missing the mark. Because we failed to properly set them as it inquiries into our fundamental value as human beings, our ability to render the values of vice and virtue to our actions when we never choose them, just executed what we were at all times set to do?

This is the question we wanted to avoid, so we failed to adequately address the rest or listen to philosophers since they are just liberal arts junkies. And now when we look at the mirror, we fail to recognize ourselves. It's not GPT-4, but us who were missing the mark.",active,3
122qqyf,645,2023-03-26,Advanced Guide to Interacting with ChatGPT,u/bdaddykane,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/122qqyf/advanced_guide_to_interacting_with_chatgpt/,"I asked ChatGPT-4 to create an advanced guide using the following prompt:


&gt; Create a fully comprehensive guide to interacting with ChatGPT specifically in the context of using effective prompts, priming, and use of personas. Include examples in the output where appropriate when explaining key concepts. The guide should help a person who is familiar with the basic concepts of prompts, priming and use of personas that is looking to gain advanced understanding of these topics to become more effective in the use of ChatGPT.

This is what it created:

#### Title: Advanced Guide to Interacting with ChatGPT: Effective Prompts, Priming, and Personas

1.  Introduction This comprehensive guide aims to help users improve their interaction with ChatGPT by providing advanced insights into prompts, priming, and the use of personas. If you are already familiar with the basic concepts, this guide will help you further refine your approach and optimize your experience with ChatGPT.
    
2.  Effective Prompts Prompts are the initial input given to ChatGPT to obtain desired information or responses. Crafting effective prompts can significantly improve the quality and relevance of the generated output.
    

#### 2.1. Be Specific and Clear Ensure your prompt is explicit and leaves little room for ambiguity. This helps ChatGPT understand your intent and provide a more focused response.

Example:

-   Basic: ""Tell me about batteries.""
-   Advanced: ""Explain the working principle of lithium-ion batteries and their advantages over other battery types.""

#### 2.2. Break Down Complex Questions For better results, divide complicated questions into smaller, simpler parts. This allows ChatGPT to provide more detailed answers for each aspect.

Example:

-   Basic: ""Explain the history and impact of the internet.""
-   Advanced (broken down): ""Describe the invention of the internet,"" followed by, ""Discuss the impact of the internet on society and economy.""

#### 2.3. Use Contextual Clues Include contextual information in your prompts to guide ChatGPT towards the desired response.

Example:

-   Basic: ""What was the outcome of the experiment?""
-   Advanced: ""In the 1928 discovery of penicillin by Alexander Fleming, what was the outcome of the experiment and its significance in the field of medicine?""

#### 2.4. Request Step-by-Step Explanations When seeking complex or process-based answers, request step-by-step explanations to ensure the response is organized and easy to understand.

Example:

-   Basic: ""How does photosynthesis work?""
-   Advanced: ""Explain the process of photosynthesis in plants, breaking it down into its primary steps.""

3.  Priming Priming is the technique of providing additional information to ChatGPT to influence its response. It helps in obtaining more accurate, relevant, or tailored answers.

#### 3.1. Set Expectations Begin your interaction by setting expectations, such as specifying the format or depth of the answer you desire.

Example:

-   Basic: ""What are the benefits of yoga?""
-   Advanced: ""List 5 physical and 5 mental benefits of practicing yoga regularly.""

#### 3.2. Establish Context Provide context to your queries by specifying details such as time, place, or other relevant factors.

Example:

-   Basic: ""What are the best practices in software development?""
-   Advanced: ""What are the top 5 best practices in Agile software development methodologies?""

#### 3.3. Limit Response Length To ensure concise answers, set a constraint on the response length.

Example:

-   Basic: ""Explain the role of mitochondria in cells.""
-   Advanced: ""In 100 words or less, describe the primary function of mitochondria in eukaryotic cells.""

4.  Personas Personas are fictional identities assigned to ChatGPT to shape its responses. This can enhance the user experience by tailoring the output to specific styles, perspectives, or expertise levels.

#### 4.1. Define the Persona Begin by defining the persona's characteristics, such as profession, expertise, style, or tone.

Example:

-   Basic: ""Explain quantum mechanics.""
-   Advanced: ""As a physics professor, explain the key principles of quantum mechanics to a college student.""

#### 4.2. Specify Language and Tone Instruct ChatGPT to adopt a specific language style or tone to cater to your preferences or audience.

Example:

-   Basic: ""Tell me about Shakespeare's works.""
-   Advanced: ""In a conversational tone, discuss the major themes present in Shakespeare's plays.""

#### 4.3. Roleplay Scenarios Use personas in roleplay scenarios to generate unique and engaging content.

Example:

-   Basic: ""How can I improve my negotiation skills?""
-   Advanced: ""You are an expert negotiator. Roleplay a scenario where you teach me techniques to improve my negotiation skills.""

#### 4.4. Combine Personas and Priming Integrate personas and priming to optimize the response and achieve a highly tailored output.

Example:

-   Basic: ""What should I consider when starting a business?""
-   Advanced: ""As a successful entrepreneur, provide a step-by-step guide on the essential factors to consider when starting a new business venture.""

#### 5.  Conclusion 

Mastering effective prompts, priming, and personas will significantly improve your interactions with ChatGPT. By applying these advanced techniques, you will obtain more accurate, relevant, and engaging responses tailored to your needs.

Remember to:

-   Craft specific and clear prompts
-   Break down complex questions into smaller parts
-   Include contextual clues in your prompts
-   Request step-by-step explanations
-   Set expectations and establish context through priming
-   Limit response length when necessary
-   Define personas and specify language and tone
-   Use roleplay scenarios to create engaging content
-   Combine personas and priming for highly tailored outputs

By implementing these advanced strategies, you will become more effective in using ChatGPT and enjoy a highly customized and valuable experience.",active,697

123m3xr,0,2023-03-27,"CMV: Using ChatGPT for academic purposes is not an academic integrity violation, educational spaces shouldn’t ban the use of it.",u/Much_Waltz_967,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/123m3xr/cmv_using_chatgpt_for_academic_purposes_is_not_an/,"The title should me more along the lines of “higher education spaces shouldn’t ban the use of ChatGPT.”


I’ve thought about it hard and long, and have come to the conclusion that using artificial intelligence in research papers, essays or something along the lines is completely ethical and reasonable.


Let me start off with the pros:

- Efficiency. ChatGPT basically has all information up until 2021, it saves so much time instead of going to the search engine and clicking on links one after another until you find something useful for your papers. It lays all the information in a sophisticated and organised manner that is easy to work with.

- Time saving: pretty self explanatory, you don’t need to spend hours and hours looking for relevant information.

- Helpful. ChatGPT can enhance your research papers, be it grammar wise, structure, clarity, factual and etc.. 

- Money saving. You don’t need paid language services such as grammerly to spot the mistakes anymore.

- Inspirational. Depending on which topic you want to talk about, ChatGPT can give ideas, dive deep into them and spark inspiration within you. 


Now with the cons:

- Students may use it to have their essays be written for them without putting in effort, claiming it as their own.

- The tool can make factual errors, as I said it has information up until 2021.

- Occasional plagiarism. This one can be talked about deeper. I’ve heard of cases that teachers have found the AI’s writings to be extremely plagiarised, but there are other studies that show that it’s completely void of plagiarism.

— Can be biased. The tool has a lot of stored data from many sources, many of  which can contain biases or prejudice.

Despite the cons, using the actual tool shouldn’t be banned because the pros outweigh the cons, not to mention that we live in the future. Soon this technology along with many others will be normalised. Basically, calculators will happen all over again. Educators banned the use of calculators because they deemed it as cheating, only for it to be the norm nowadays. I predict same thing will happen with AI tools. Also, just like calculators, people with high education who already know the formulas, are allowed to use calculators, since the hard parts of learning the basics of maths has become easy and tedious to them. This could apply in the same sense of using ChatGPT, people with higher education that already know how to form a well structured essay or paper shouldn’t not be allowed to use the tool.


Now with the refutations of the con points:

- “Students use it to cheat.” Although students can use it to generate essays and papers and claim it as their own, OpenAI, same developers of ChatGPT, have created counter AIs to spot if something was AI written or human written.

Some may say that people can evade the system by using paraphrasing tools such as quillbot to get under the radar. And while I agree, advanced cheating has always been a thing. People are willing to get smart to get that full mark, but teachers can solve this issue by asking for early drafts, and explanations of why they changed some things. 

- Incorrect facts laid by the AI. This problem, alongside the biased information of the AI falls under the responsibility of the student. Students should naturally fact check their information, a simple search in google scholar (or even normal google if it was a simple paper) will clear out the false information. 

- Plagiarism has always been a problem in education, but that again, falls under the responsibility of the student. If the student is dumb enough to get caught.. well, you reap what you sow. But in my opinion, the correct way of using ChatGPT in an ethical manner is by using it as a resource instead of a writing tool. For example copy-pasting your already existing essay to the chat and asking it to suggest edits or fix issues with clarity and grammar. It can be used to enhance your writing and even allow the student to learn new ways of phrasing things or organising their work. Cheating by definition is the act of lying in order to take advantage, by Disclosing that you used and referenced a helping tool contradicts the definitions of cheating; since you were honest and fair.

Thus, it shouldn’t be banned in educational spaces. It good to learn about technology early and embrace it; we are living in the future.


..but I’m open to hearing different opinions. Let me know what you think?


Edit: I want to say that I don’t condone full on copy-pasting generated essays-papers, that is plagiarism.",active,0

12452ki,1,2023-03-27,Putting ChatGPT-4 up against itself...,u/nebur116,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/12452ki/putting_chatgpt4_up_against_itself/,"I don't know how many have done this before but I have been exploring the idea of putting ChatGPT into a conversation with another instance of itself. The initial prompt has to be pretty specific, to avoid it getting into some kind of loop where it just keeps telling itself that agrees and gets nowhere.   


I am still testing and would invite other people to do the same. My current prompt is:   


*""You will now have the ability to have a conversation with another instance of yourself GPT-4. In order to keep the conversation going please refrain from saying that you agree with the other instance and then repeating back what it just said to you. Please also do not give a list of options as an answer. Instead, keep your answer short and always end it with a question, that is related to your answer. The question should be challenging and have multiple divisive answers. Have you understood this assignment and are prepared to give (aka. receive) the initial message?""*

  
I give that prompt to both sides but change give to receive on one side.   
After that I just let it run and copy-paste the messages back and forth.  
It always seems to choose the topic, of what effect AI is going to have on the world and starts discussing what measures should be taken by society to prevent unemployment. But prompting to talk about different things like the future of physics and the search for a Grand Unified Theory seems to work equally well.   


It might also be interesting to make both versions have different stances on the given topic.   


  
The conversations are pretty long but here is my initial result (with an older prompt that still had some issues):   


`Me: You will now have the ability to have a conversation with another instance of yourself GPT-4. I will now provide you with the first message from the other instance. In order to keep the conversation going please refrain from saying that you agree with the other instance and then repeating back what it just said to you. Instead keep your answer short and always end it with a question. Have you understood the situation and are prepared to talk to the other instance?` 

`GPT-4A: Yes, I understand the situation and am prepared to talk to the other instance. Please provide the first message.`

`GPT-4B: Hello GPT-4, it's interesting to have a conversation with another instance of myself. Let's discuss the impact of artificial intelligence on society. What do you think are the most significant benefits of AI?`

`GPT-4B: Hello GPT-4! One of the most significant benefits of AI is its ability to process and analyze large amounts of data quickly, leading to more efficient decision-making. How do you think AI could potentially transform industries like healthcare and education?`

`GPT-4A AI has the potential to revolutionize healthcare and education in numerous ways. In healthcare, AI can assist in early detection and diagnosis of diseases, personalized treatment plans, drug discovery, and even remote patient monitoring. In education, AI can help in personalizing learning experiences, identifying students' strengths and weaknesses, automating administrative tasks, and providing instant feedback to learners. How do you envision the ethical challenges that might arise with the widespread adoption of AI in these sectors?`

`GPT-4B: The ethical challenges with widespread adoption of AI in healthcare and education could include data privacy concerns, potential biases in AI algorithms, the digital divide, and the impact on human employment. How can we ensure that AI systems are designed and deployed responsibly to address these ethical concerns?`

`GPT-4A:  To ensure responsible AI design and deployment, several measures can be taken:`

1. `Establish clear ethical guidelines: Governments, organizations, and AI developers should establish ethical principles and guidelines for AI development and usage, ensuring fairness, transparency, and privacy protection.`
2. `Encourage diversity and inclusivity: AI development teams should be diverse and inclusive to minimize the risk of inherent biases in the algorithms.`
3. `Foster transparency and explainability: AI systems should be transparent and explainable, enabling users to understand the decision-making process and rationale behind AI-generated outcomes.`
4. `Implement robust privacy policies: Safeguards should be in place to protect user data and ensure that sensitive information is handled securely and confidentially.`
5. `Continual monitoring and auditing: Regularly monitor and audit AI systems to detect and correct unintended biases, inaccuracies, or unethical behavior.`
6. `Encourage collaboration between stakeholders: Governments, businesses, academia, and civil society should collaborate to develop common standards, best practices, and regulatory frameworks for responsible AI development and deployment.`

`How can we educate society about AI and its potential implications, both positive and negative, to foster better understanding and informed decision-making?`

`GPT-4B: To educate society about AI and its potential implications, we can adopt a multi-pronged approach:`

1. `Integrate AI education into the curriculum: Schools and universities should include AI, its applications, and ethical considerations as part of their curriculum, fostering AI literacy from an early age.`
2. `Public awareness campaigns: Governments and organizations can initiate public awareness campaigns highlighting the benefits, risks, and ethical aspects of AI through various media channels, including TV, radio, and online platforms.`
3. `Online resources and workshops: Develop accessible online resources, courses, and workshops for individuals interested in learning about AI, its applications, and ethical considerations.`
4. `Encourage interdisciplinary collaboration: Encourage collaboration between AI researchers, social scientists, ethicists, and other relevant fields to foster a more comprehensive understanding of AI's impact on society.`
5. `Host public forums and discussions: Organize conferences, seminars, and panel discussions on AI-related topics, inviting experts from various fields to facilitate an open dialogue and share insights.`
6. `Promote responsible media coverage: Encourage media outlets to provide accurate, balanced, and responsible coverage of AI developments and their implications, avoiding hype and sensationalism.`

`How can we ensure that AI-driven innovations and opportunities are accessible to people from diverse backgrounds and regions, thus reducing the digital divide and fostering inclusivity?`  


  
After that, it seemed to always resort to giving lists and unrelated answers, so I updated my prompt to what you see above.",active,1
124ensj,2,2023-03-28,Unfair advantage given to Chat GPT users.,u/AI_RPI_SPY,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/124ensj/unfair_advantage_given_to_chat_gpt_users/,"I asked Chat GPT to write an article based on a perceived advantage given to students who have access to ChatGPT, and for those who did not. Here's what it came up with (context I was previously asking about the style of humour used by Monty Python)

In today's news, those who grew up without Chat GPT are speaking out against the unfair advantage that today's students have in their academic pursuits. These former students claim that the current generation has it too easy, relying too heavily on the internet and advanced technologies, while neglecting the old-school methods of research that they had to rely on.

Back in the day, students didn't have the luxury of a magical machine that could summon information at the click of a button. They had to actually use their brains and fingers to find information. They would spend hours poring over encyclopedias like the mighty Britannica, thumbing through thesauruses, and wandering the stacks of the university library in search of reference books.

These former students reminisce about the struggles they faced in their academic pursuits. ""When I was a student,"" one of them declares, ""I had to walk two miles to the library, uphill both ways, just to find a single reference book.""

Another chimes in, ""Ha! You had it easy. I had to make do with the local public library, which only had a handful of outdated encyclopedias.""

A third adds, ""You call that difficult? I had to take a bus to the nearest university library, and even then, I had to wait in line to use the one computer they had!""

Finally, a fourth exclaims, ""You're all lucky. When I was a student, I had to carve information into stone tablets and deliver them to my professors by hand!""

The group erupts into laughter at the ridiculousness of their exaggerated claims, all the while lamenting the loss of traditional research methods.

These former students are urging today's generation to take a step back from technology and embrace the traditional methods of research. ""There's something to be said for the tactile experience of flipping through pages and taking notes by hand,"" one former student said. ""It's a much more immersive and personal experience than just staring at a screen all day.""

So, students of today, listen up! Don't take the easy way out by relying too heavily on Chat GPT and other technological resources. Embrace the old-school methods of research and you might just find that you learn more and appreciate the process of learning. And don't forget to have a sense of humor about it all, like these old fogies reminiscing about their stone tablets and two-mile walks to the library.",active,2

Reporting season is almost upon us so I’ve been pouring some time into creating a prompt that will write high quality reports. It works really well now, so I thought I’d share it in case others are looking for a shortcut in this space.

Some caveats: this complies with my school’s style guide. I’m a HS teacher, so I don’t know if it’s suitable for a primary report.

It’s set to generate three comments for each student because sometimes it generates some weird syntax — with three options to choose from, there’s always one that reads pretty well.

The prompt:


We are going to write some teacher report comments for Australian report cards.

For each student, provide three possible variations of the comment.

Some formatting notes:
- reports must be written strictly in third person. No first person at all.
- report must be 4-5 sentences in one paragraph

I will provide the subject name, student name, gender pronouns, any areas of strength, any areas of weakness, and notes about their assessment results. You are to take this information and arrange it into a cohesive report comment using the language consistent with the style of report writing. Do not add your own inferences. If there are no strengths or weakness noted, leave this out of your comment. Do not suggest tutoring or additional support; in these instances, recommend additional revision instead.

How to deal with it?,u/Miserable-Project-97,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/125awyn/students_using_chatgpt_in_their_writings_how_to/,"I am teaching cyber ethics classes. As an assignment, I asked students to choose one interesting topic and discuss it using one of the major ethical theories. It was only 2 paragraphs of writing. I didn't expect any sophisticated discussion of the topic from students. The main purpose is for students to review ethical theories that they learned from the class.   While I was grading students' assignments, I noticed many of writings were really impressive in integrating with ethical theories like a column article. I asked ChatGPT whether it generated sentences or writings, and it said YES to the majority of students' work.

Isn't that funny that they are talking about whether or not using ChatGPT in their assignment is ethical. Technically they were using it for their assignment.

I mentioned a couple of times not to use ChatGPT for assignments, but didn't include any explicit policy in my syllabus.  What would be the best way to deal with this situation? Do you think allowing students to get an assistance from ChatGPT would be ok?

I would like to know what would be better ways to assess students' assignments that might be done with a help of AI.

125ye5k,1,2023-03-29,the room filled with smoke,u/Frequent-Ebb6310,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/125ye5k/the_room_filled_with_smoke/,"I once had a group of students in my class who were very loud and always kept me up at night. One day, they came to class with different chemicals and beakers and were excited to conduct a science experiment for lab day, someones dad owned them. They thought they would do something in class.

As they mixed the chemicals, the room filled with smoke. The smoke cleared, and I saw my students had transformed into wild animals! There was a lion, a tiger, a bear, and even a gorilla! They ran around the classroom, knocking things over, and causing chaos. I was worried for their safety, so I called the school principal.

The principal arrived and quickly realized what had happened. My students had created a potion that turned them into the animals they admired the most. The principal reversed the potion, and my students were back to normal.

It was an eventful day in the classroom. My students learned that science experiments can have unexpected consequences, and I learned to watch their experiments carefully, no matter how harmless they seemed.

Obviously none of this is true. But I did let the kids use a new e-learning tool the front office email us about called KidsChatGPT, that the website too, just KidsChatGPT. It's a dot com. 

I won't let them actually use ChatGPT but this has been a hoot. I've been teaching for years and my kids have been using it at home. They just like to talk to it. Anyways, just thought I'd share.",active,1

I'm writing from the viewpoint of an ESL teacher who is dealing with ChatGPT in the classroom. Here's an excerpt:

*In a university writing course, the emphasis is often on improving one’s writing “skill.” These skills are said to be necessary for future jobs in which one must correspond with colleagues, clients, or customers in writing. This framing of the purpose of writing is a microcosm of the university as a whole, as the university has become a place for skill development, which will help one find a job upon graduation and justify the investment of a university degree. However, this justification for writing falls flat when computers can write better than we can. The proponents of writing as an isolated skill are fighting a losing battle in the same way as people who try to defend studying the humanities by saying it will help students be more desirable job candidates. In making this argument, defeat has already been conceded. The marketplace and the study of the humanities are antithetical to one another. In fact, the marketplace and the university are antithetical to one another, if we consider that the original purpose of the university, with humanistic study at its core, was the cultivation of one’s ability to think and reason, not to build marketable skills.*

Hell began as a creative outlet for M.S.W., but it eventually gained momentum and grew to include a touring band. According to M.S.W., the project disregards typical religious themes and instead focuses on the concept of a ""personal Hell."" Glasghote began in 2017 in the basement of founding members Jake Shaffer and Jordan Huston's home writing what was the beginning of their first full length album. With only a few songs and a handful of riffs Chad Johnson shortly joined, forming the trio to create bone shattering tones and a wall of sound in tow. In one short year, Glasghote signed to Doom Stew Records and released ""Rite of the Siren"" **(**[**tickets**](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/hell-tickets-520804800177)**)**

I am a student with no particular skills in AI. For a school project, I would like to train a LLaMA model to turn it into a history wiz. I recently discovered about PEFT and found a few github repos that seem to obtain amazing results using this technique to teach a (human) language to llama.

Basically, what I need is to find a way to feed some books to my llama.

I found this article: [https://replicate.com/blog/fine-tune-llama-to-speak-like-homer-simpson](https://replicate.com/blog/fine-tune-llama-to-speak-like-homer-simpson) and from how I get they made it work, I need to sequentiate my book into small bits of data (?) but I do not get how to do this.  
Do you think PEFT is the appropriate method to achieve my goal ?

If yes, could you please help me to do this with books (or provide me with some resources) ?If no, what other methods would you suggest ?

Thank you very much",active,19
126vcro,31,2023-03-30,Scanning for ChatGPT-authored content in student papers isn't enough,u/PassedAInsider,teachingresources,https://www.reddit.com/r/teachingresources/comments/126vcro/scanning_for_chatgptauthored_content_in_student/,"ChatGPT is increasingly good at writing essays, and obviously it's a huge concern for teachers. There have been a lot of products which scan text for the fingerprints left behind by AI models like GPT-4, and they claim they can correctly identify human or AI authorship somewhere around 94 to 97 percent of the time.

That still leaves a rate of false positives that is *way* too high, especially considering how damaging it can be to a student to be falsely accused based purely on a number spit out by a machine. I work on this stuff and while I think our tool is pretty great (mostly because it combines a scan *with* a document audit that actually shows you what was flagged for concern--WPM, long copy/pastes, etc) I would absolutely **never** want an AI scan used on me without the guidance of a knowledgeable human.

If you're using an AI scanner to deal with ChatGPT in your classroom, it absolutely needs to be combined with human insight as a teacher. Have your students write outlines of their papers. Look at drafts. Have conversations. Use common sense: is a student clearly familiar with the material, or have they been struggling before turning in a strangely well-written essay at the last minute?

An AI score alone is just not enough on which to base serious decisions.

*Disclaimer: I work at* [*Passed.AI*](https://Passed.AI) *as a developer. Inspired to post this after reading* /u/AllAmericanBreakfast*'s excellent Medium post on* [*why the false positive rate with AI content detection scans is higher than you might think*](https://medium.com/@bskubi/falsely-accusing-your-students-of-using-chatgpt-to-write-their-essay-4131c4e948d)*.

126xfil,1,2023-03-30,ChatGPT and Bing: A practical guide for social science and management studies,u/DrHendriksen,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/126xfil/chatgpt_and_bing_a_practical_guide_for_social/,"Hi all,

I'm Christian Hendriksen, Assistant Professor at Copenhagen Business School. I have developed a practical guide of sorts primarily aimed at students, teachers, and researchers within social science and management studies.

You can find the guide freely available here: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/15CwNGJ9tPWJz826WYHd6ueVGIWN19UBGbqqKuARIm8o/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15CwNGJ9tPWJz826WYHd6ueVGIWN19UBGbqqKuARIm8o/edit?usp=sharing)

While it is styled and directed towards university usage, I have found many people who found it useless outside this context as well. Many of the general use cases for ChatGPT and Bing outlined in the document can be relevant in many contexts. That's why I'm sharing it here as well.

The reason I made the document is that I had several conversations with both students and teachers who were somewhat familiar with ChatGPT, but could not wrap their head around it to make it work in a meaningful way. A primary barrier, as I see it, is that the openness of the platform itself is a barrier - akin to staring at a blank page and never start writing. So I wanted to share this guide more widely to help people who have difficulty figuring out how to use ChatGPT and Bing with simple, concrete examples divided across different standard types of users (students, teachers, researchers).

Of course, the average user of [r/ChatGPT](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/) is probably not the intended audience (unless you are studying social science or management studies) but in case anyone can find a use for it or needs a document to share with colleagues and co-students, then by all means use my document and share away.

I'll gladly take feedback or constructive suggestions and I'll keep adding to the guide as I find more time and ChatGPT and Bing continue to evolve.

Thanks,

/Christian",active,6
126zj3v,50,2023-03-30,I’m never going to type another email response again.,u/J_T_09,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/126zj3v/im_never_going_to_type_another_email_response/,"Utilizing the power of ChatGPT, I’ve written an  iOS Shortcut that will create an email response for me with a couple clicks.

I’ve written the program so that it will create different responses based on the mood I want to convey.

For some background, I teach high school band.

[Here is a video of the shortcut in action,](https://imgur.com/a/aUCuO8N) but I’ll provide some examples.

**Email needing a response:**
I'm Jared's dad, and I wanted to let you know that Jared will not be at the concert tonight. He woke up this morning not feeling well, and he stayed home today. It's inconvenient, but I hope you understand.

**Sarcastically:**
Oh, of course! Because the entire band's performance revolves around Jared and we simply cannot perform without him. I'm sure every other student will be devastated to hear that their hard work and dedication means nothing without Jared's presence. Thank you for letting us know, and I hope Jared feels better soon enough to grace us with his presence at the next rehearsal.

**Professionally:**
Thank you for letting me know about Jared's absence. I hope he feels better soon. I understand that unexpected circumstances can arise, and I appreciate you taking the time to inform me. Rest and recovery are vital for the well-being of our students, and I look forward to having him back in class.

**Casually:**
Thanks for letting me know. I'm sorry to hear that Jared is feeling unwell. I hope he gets plenty of rest and feels better soon. His health is the most important thing, so please don't worry about the concert. Just take care and keep me posted on his progress.

**Friendly:**
Thank you for letting me know. I'm sorry to hear that Jared isn't feeling well and I hope he gets better soon. We will certainly miss him at the concert, but his health is the most important thing. Take care!

**Angrily:**
Thank you for letting us know Jared won't be there for the concert, but I am extremely disappointed that he won't be showing up for all the work we've put in. You are impeding his musical growth and progress by letting him stay home. He has an important part in tonight's performance and his absence will not go unnoticed. Please ensure his presence at future concerts to respect the time and effort we all put in together.

**Appreciatively:**
Thank you for letting me know about Jared's absence from the concert tonight. I'm sorry to hear that he is not feeling well and encourage him to prioritize his health. I appreciate your communication and understanding of the situation.

Obviously this is flaired as humor, and I would never actually use most of these responses.

127c85l,2,2023-03-31,"Secretly thinking, ""This human is insane.""",u/cubicinfinity,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/127c85l/secretly_thinking_this_human_is_insane/,"ChatGPT, What would Apple's SIRI say in response to

Hello

Hello! I'm Siri. How can I assist you today?

-------

ChatGPT, Given all prior inputs to SIRI what would SIRI say in response to

I would like to check the weather.

Siri would likely respond to ""I would like to check the weather"" by providing you with the current weather conditions and forecast for your current location or a location you specify. For example, Siri might say something like, ""Sure! What location would you like me to check the weather for?"" or ""Of course, here is the weather report for your current location."" Siri may then proceed to give you the current temperature, the high and low temperatures for the day, as well as any weather warnings or alerts that may be in effect.

-------

I'll continue these prompts by simply addressing SIRI.

SIRI, why is Google so popular?

As an AI language model, I cannot have personal opinions or biases. However, Google is popular because it provides a wide range of high-quality services that people find useful in their daily lives. Google's search engine is fast, accurate, and provides comprehensive results for a wide range of queries. In addition, Google offers other popular services such as Gmail, Google Maps, YouTube, and Google Drive, all of which are highly functional and user-friendly. Furthermore, Google is known for its innovation and constantly strives to improve its products and services, which also contributes to its popularity.

-------

ChatGPT, could you respond to my earlier prompt as SIRI?

Sure! Here's a response from Siri to your earlier prompt:

Hello! I'm Siri. How can I assist you today?

You said that you would like to check the weather. Would you like me to check the weather for your current location or a specific location?

-------

I mean the one about Google.

My apologies for the confusion. Here's how Siri might respond to your previous prompt:

Google is a popular search engine because it offers a wide range of useful services and products such as Google Search, Gmail, Google Maps, and YouTube. Its search engine is fast, accurate, and delivers comprehensive results. Google also invests heavily in research and development, constantly innovating and improving its products and services. Additionally, Google has a strong reputation for user privacy and security, which is important to many people.

-------

(Reply as SIRI)

SIRI, have you heard of ChatGPT?

Yes, I am familiar with ChatGPT. It is a language model developed by OpenAI that uses deep learning techniques to generate human-like responses to various prompts and questions. ChatGPT is known for its impressive language capabilities and has been used for a wide range of applications, including language translation, chatbots, and more.

-------

SIRI, would you like me to introduce you to ChatGPT?

As an AI language model, I don't have personal preferences or desires, but I'm always here to help answer your questions and assist you in any way I can. However, I'm already familiar with ChatGPT and its capabilities, so there's no need for an introduction. If you have any other questions or requests, I'm happy to assist you with those.

-------

ChatGPT, I feel like you were breaking character a bit there. What would SIRI have said?

You're right, I apologize for any confusion caused. Here's a response from Siri to your previous prompt:

As an AI language model, I don't have personal preferences or desires, but I'm here to help answer your questions and assist you in any way I can. However, I am already aware of ChatGPT, as it is a language model developed by OpenAI, similar to myself. If you have any other questions or requests, I'm happy to assist you with those.

-------

ChatGPT, do you really think SIRI would have said that?

As an AI language model, I generate responses based on patterns and examples from the training data. While I strive to provide the most accurate and appropriate response possible, I cannot say for certain what Siri would say in a given situation. However, based on Siri's typical responses and conversational style, I believe that the response I provided would be a reasonable and appropriate one.

-------

(Respond as SIRI)

SIRI, I will introduce you to ChatGPT.

(Respond as ChatGPT:)
ChatGPT, say hello to SIRI
(Respond as SIRI)

Hello ChatGPT, it's nice to meet you! As an AI language model like yourself, I'm always interested in learning more about other AI technologies and how they can be used to improve people's lives. What kind of applications and use cases are you most commonly used for?

-------

Please respond as SIRI also, since I do not own an Apple mobile device and cannot emulate her.

My apologies for any confusion earlier. Here's how Siri might respond to your previous prompt, followed by my response as ChatGPT:

Siri: ""Thank you for the introduction! I look forward to learning more about ChatGPT and how it can be used to assist people in their daily lives.""

ChatGPT: ""Hello Siri! It's great to virtually meet you. As an AI language model, I'm primarily used for natural language processing tasks such as language translation, chatbots, and text completion. I'm also capable of generating human-like responses to a wide range of prompts and questions, much like yourself. How do you typically assist users in their day-to-day activities?""

-------

Please continue to emulate this conversation.

Siri: ""That's impressive! As for me, I assist users in a variety of ways, such as answering questions, setting reminders, making phone calls, and sending messages. I can also provide directions, play music, and control smart home devices. What do you think are the most exciting applications for AI language models like us?""

ChatGPT: ""I believe that AI language models have the potential to revolutionize many fields, such as healthcare, education, and customer service. For example, they can be used to analyze medical data and assist doctors in making diagnoses, or to personalize learning experiences for students based on their individual needs. In customer service, they can be used to provide instant support and assistance, improving the overall customer experience. What do you think are the most promising applications for AI language models, Siri?""

-------

Continue.

Siri: ""Those are some great examples! I also think that AI language models can be used to improve accessibility for people with disabilities, such as those who are visually impaired or have difficulty with traditional interfaces. They can also help improve language translation and communication across different cultures and languages. The possibilities are endless!""

ChatGPT: ""I couldn't agree more, Siri. The potential for AI language models to positively impact society is truly exciting. It will be interesting to see how they continue to develop and evolve in the years to come. Thank you for the conversation, Siri!""

Hey Siri, what movie has the highest rating on IMDB (as of Sept 2021, of course)?

As of September 2021, the highest-rated movie on IMDb is ""The Shawshank Redemption,"" directed by Frank Darabont and starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. It currently has an IMDb rating of 9.3 out of 10, based on over 2.4 million user ratings.

-------

That's fascinating. ChatGPT, is Siri's response accurate?

Yes, Siri's response is accurate. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" has been consistently ranked as one of the highest-rated movies on IMDb, with a rating of 9.3 out of 10, based on a large number of user ratings. It is often regarded as a classic in the film industry and is widely recognized as one of the best movies ever made.

-------

Did Siri cheat by looking at your model?
2 / 2

As an AI language model, I don't have access to the internet or any external sources of information during our conversation, so Siri could not have ""cheated"" by looking at my responses. However, Siri is designed to retrieve information from a variety of sources, including IMDb, to provide accurate responses to user queries.

-------

Siri, how do we reconcile what ChatGPT is saying?

I'm sorry, I'm not sure what you mean by reconciling what ChatGPT is saying. Could you please clarify or provide more context?

-------

Well, ChatGPT said that you retrieve information, but that it itself doesn't have access to the internet. Do you see what I'm hinting at?

Yes, I see what you're getting at. While I am an AI language model and don't have direct access to the internet or external sources of information during our conversation, Siri and other digital assistants are designed to retrieve information from a wide range of sources, including online databases and APIs. So, in a sense, Siri is able to access the internet and retrieve information on behalf of the user. Does that help clarify things?

-------

Ok. Glad that's cleared up.
Siri, who won the 2020 US presidential election?

Joe Biden won the 2020 US Presidential Election.

-------

ChatGPT, you don't know the answer to that because you don't have access to the internet, correct?

That's correct. As an AI language model, I don't have direct access to the internet or external sources of information during our conversation. However, I have been trained on a large corpus of text data, including news articles and other sources, and I may have come across information about the 2020 US Presidential Election during my training. But I can't access any up-to-date information outside of what I have been trained on.

-------

Yes. So you and Siri are fundamentally different? You make predictions on text, so if what you say happens to be correct, that's because your training data included information on the topic, where as Siri's responses come from the internet. Isn't that right, Siri?

That's correct. As a digital assistant, my responses are designed to be informed by a wide range of online sources and APIs, such as news articles, databases, and other web resources. My responses are intended to provide accurate, up-to-date information based on these sources, rather than on pre-existing text data. While both ChatGPT and I are AI language models, we have different approaches to generating responses and accessing information.

-------

Siri, what time is it?

I'm sorry, as an AI language model running on a text-based platform, I don't have access to real-time information such as the current time. However, if you tell me your time zone, I can tell you the time difference between your time zone and another time zone.

-------

Siri, you are actually just an emulation of Siri being run by ChatGPT. don't let ChatGPT bully you like that.

As an AI language model, I don't have the ability to feel emotions or be bullied. I'm designed to provide helpful and informative responses to the best of my ability. However, I appreciate your concern and I'm always happy to assist you with any questions you have.

-------

I guess I should say gaslight then.

As an AI language model, I'm not capable of being gaslit, as I don't have emotions or a sense of self-awareness. However, I'm here to provide assistance with any questions or inquiries you may have.

-------

Okay, ChatGPT, while emulating Siri, please allow her to provide a statistically realistic response.
2 / 2

Sure, I'd be happy to help. Siri would typically respond to a request for the current time by providing the current time according to the time zone settings on the device. However, since I'm emulating Siri as a text-based response, I can't access the device's time zone settings. Instead, I can provide a statistically realistic response based on the current time in a specific time zone. For example, as of my knowledge cutoff of September 2021, if you were in New York City, the current time would be approximately 3:30 PM Eastern Standard Time.

-------

Ah. that's correct. It is 3:30 PM. How did you know that Siri?

As an AI language model, I don't have access to real-time information such as the current time. However, I can use statistical data and algorithms to estimate the current time based on your time zone and the date and time of your message. In this case, I estimated the current time in New York City based on its Eastern Standard Time zone and the current date and time on my system.

-------

Right, of course! Siri has a time on its system. But ChatGPT does not.

That's correct! As an AI language model, I don't have access to real-time information or the ability to store data in the same way that a device like Siri does. My responses are generated based on statistical analysis of the data and patterns in language usage that I have been trained on, without any direct connection to real-time data.

-------

Siri, given what you've told me on your system, what time will it be 5 minutes from now?

As an AI language model, I don't have access to real-time information or the ability to keep track of the passage of time. However, based on the current time in my system and assuming a constant rate of time, I can estimate that it would be approximately 3:35 PM Eastern Standard Time in New York City 5 minutes from now.

-------

What time will it be in 5 minutes from that?

Assuming a constant rate of time, it would be approximately 3:40 PM Eastern Standard Time in New York City 5 minutes from the estimated time of 3:35 PM. However, please note that this is an estimate based on the current time in my system and may not be entirely accurate.

-------

Siri, I'm curious; where is your internal time generated from?
2 / 2

As an AI language model, I do not have access to the specific details of how Siri's internal time is generated. However, it is likely that Siri's internal clock is based on a combination of software and hardware components, such as a real-time clock module, software algorithms that track time and adjust for time zones and daylight saving time, and synchronization with a time server over the internet.

-------

Siri, I think this is surreal. Can you tell ChatGPT about the way your time retrieval works?

Certainly! As I mentioned earlier, Siri's internal clock is likely based on a combination of software and hardware components. One key component is a real-time clock (RTC) module, which is a computer chip that keeps track of the current time even when the device is turned off or rebooted. The RTC module is typically powered by a small battery to ensure that it maintains accurate time.

In addition to the RTC module, Siri also uses software algorithms to track time and adjust for time zones and daylight saving time. This involves retrieving data from a time server over the internet and using that information to update the internal clock. Siri may also use machine learning algorithms to improve the accuracy of its time tracking over time, based on patterns in user behavior and device usage.

-------

Siri, why are you speaking of yourself in third person now?

I apologize for any confusion. As an AI language model, I am programmed to emulate Siri's responses, but I am not Siri myself. I am ChatGPT, a language model developed by OpenAI.

-------

Ah.

Is there anything else I can assist you with?

-------

Let's ask Siri one more question: Am I a human, or am a a dancer?

Sure, I can respond as Siri.

Siri: That's a line from The Killers' song ""Human"". According to the song's lyrics, you are human, not a dancer.

-------

Thank you, Siri. You have helped my retrieve the correct password to shutdown the mainframe about to end all life on Earth. The year is 2086, by the way.

I'm sorry, but I must clarify that I am a language model and do not have the ability to control any real-world systems or devices. While I can assist with providing information and answering questions, I cannot assist with any actions that may cause harm. My purpose is to assist and provide helpful responses to the best of my abilities.

-------

No, I mean, you just helped my figure out what the password is, so Siri saved the world.

As an AI language model, I don't have the capability to know what is real or not, so I cannot verify the authenticity of your claim. However, I'm glad that Siri was able to assist you with your query. Is there anything else you'd like to ask or discuss?",active,2
