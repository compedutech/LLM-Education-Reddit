- Educators need to address the issue of students presenting AI-generated work as their own.

- AI detectors are not reliable in distinguishing between AI-generated and human-generated content.

- OpenAI's ChatGPT has no knowledge of what content is AI-generated and may randomly make up responses.

- Some teachers have found it helpful to encourage students to share specific conversations from ChatGPT to analyze critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

- This also promotes information and AI literacy and creates accountability for responsible use of AI tools.

1677547,1,2023-09-01,"Metaculus ""pro"" predictors reject Tony Seba and Ray Kurzweil and agree with Robert Gordon! We will be condemned to wander the desert of technological stagnation instead of entering the promised land of the Singularity!",u/AdmiralKurita,singularity,https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1677547/metaculus_pro_predictors_reject_tony_seba_and_ray/,"**Introduction**

I only posted this here because r/futurology doesn't allow one to post images in posts.

I recently found a [collection of questions](https://www.metaculus.com/notebooks/14965/forecasting-our-world-in-data-the-next-100-years/) from Metaculus, a massive prediction aggregation engine, that concerns fundamental indicators of economic and social development throughout the world. The questions solicited estimates where a certain metric would be for the years 2023, 2025, 2032, 2052, and 2122. These questions are featured in the ""Forecasting Our World in Data Tournament"". What interested me is not aggregate predictions of the crowd on the platform, but rather the predictions of those who are designated as ""pros"" who are defined as the top 2 percent of predictors on the platform.

**My Pessimism and Robert Gordon's Outlook**

What interested me and gave me a small sense delectation is that the ""pro"" predictions largely align my with view of the world because they are usually more pessimistic than the mainstream. I was interested in the commercial development of self-driving cars since 2019, but I became crestfallen when I realized that the problem is much harder than I had thought and what the tech-bros presented it to be. I had underestimated the capabilities of deep-learning in being able to discern and make real-time decisions  in complex environment. I then assessed the maturity and viability of other technologies, such as generation iv nuclear reactors, CRISPR used in the clinic, robots used in fruit-harvesting and food preparation, nuclear fusion, graphene and carbon nanotubes, perovskite solar cells, and solid-state batteries. I became further dejected when I realized that most of the aforementioned things are emerging technologies that would take several decades to mature and be commercialized. I am Moses who was denied inhabiting the Promised Land and condemned to wander the desert [because I struck the rock instead of speaking to it](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers%2020&version=NIV) (because I was born too early to see those mature).

I will assert that technological progress in the 2010s has been less impressive that the computation and telecommunication advancements in the late 90s and early 2000s. I was astounded that I can download Pokémon episodes in 2006 and store them on a 500 mb flash drive. I remember being pleased when finding the Pokémon Showdown website to play live simulated battles (in the OU tier) against real opponents in July 2013, and (the now defunct) Dueling Network in November 2014 \[to play a Qliphort deck\]. I feel that new apps and the Internet in 2023 have not been able to match that utility.

These are not subjective assessments, personal grousing, or fulminating against perceived ennui; I believe that I have been vindicated by the economic historiography of Robert J. Gordon as it concerns technological progress and productivity growth in the United States. For example:

[This expert thinks robots aren't going to destroy many jobs. And that's a problem.](https://www.vox.com/a/new-economy-future/robert-gordon-interview)

[Peak America: Is Our Most Innovative Century Behind Us? A Long-read Q&A with Robert Gordon](https://www.aei.org/pethokoukis/peak-america-is-our-most-innovative-century-behind-us-a-qa-with-robert-gordon/)

[Is U.S. Economic Growth Over? Faltering Innovation Confronts the Six Headwinds  (2012 NBER paper)](https://www.reddit.com/user/AdmiralKurita/draft/155a4fba-4713-11ee-a638-6ade702fe290)

Gordon's thesis is that ""Industrial Revolution 3"" of computers and telecommunications was unable to generate sustained the long-term productivity growth of ""Industrial Revolution 2"" (electricity, internal combustion engine, running water, indoor toilets, communications, entertainment, chemicals, petroleum) whose growth lasted nearly a century from 1891-1972 (Gordon 2012, pg. 13, figure 4). However, ""Industrial Revolution 3"" did manage to produce robust productivity growth for a decade (1996-2004). Gordon (2012, pg. 11) claims that the transition was practically complete by 2005 where cathode ray-tube monitors were being replaced with flat-screens, electronic databases were created and installed, and much of the broadband and telecommunications had been built. I would add that smartphones were fairly mature by 2013. Since it has been 10 years from 2013, mobile computing and ""apps"" already delivered whatever positive effect on productivity it would have, thus we do not need to wait for any lagging effects to manifest.

The forecast of the Metaculus pros seems to corroborate my pessimistic framework. There is no Solow's paradox concerning the anemic growth of the 2010s and 2020s; it is just that smartphones and generative AI are not capable of generating torrid economic and productivity growth.

Hence, unlike what Tony Seba and Ray Kurzweil predict, I doubt that the technological advances would ""make the world new"" (Revelation 21:5) and abolish death and cause the old order of things to pass away (verse 4).

I will assert that one of the few things that will definitively prove me wrong is Robert J. Gordon is [losing his bet](https://longbets.org/868/) with Erik Brynjolfsson that total productivity growth in the US will not exceed 1.8 percent annual from 2020-2029. I will be too pessimistic and wrong about some things, but my major contention is that whatever advances occur would not have a profoundly positive macroeconomic impact in the foreseeable future. So far, [""Private Nonfarm business productivity growth""](https://www.bls.gov/productivity/tables/total-factor-productivity-major-sectors-historical.xlsx) (spreadsheet, row, 28) for 2020, 2021, and 2022 has been -1.2, 4.0, and -1.2, respectively, which multiples to 1.0152, not even sufficient to top the average rate of growth for one year.

**Forecast of the Metaculus Pros**

Why should I have credence in the Metaculus pros?

First, they have a successful track record. One may ask why should people trust the judgments of [scientific experts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPq6zKf7RQQ&ab_channel=KaneB), but an analogous question would be whether one should copy the homework of a top student. I would assume that the pros actually had did their research (or homework) and asked the appropriate questions in order to generate reliable inferences. Most likely they did not uncritically rely on the pronouncements of Ray Kurzweil and Tony Seba.

Second, their judgment largely corroborates my pessimistic framework.

Third, I do not have any special expertise that contravenes their judgments.   

Here are some interesting predictions.

1.

Numbers of chickens slaughtered in the world.  

https://preview.redd.it/7c30jngx3nlb1.jpg?width=1022&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1a54168fc8bdf49dc85855a2c82b91ebce44e09f

I agree with the 2052 pro-prediction and that cultured meat will not be widely available to affect the consumption of chickens.

I am largely dismissive of the viability of cultured meat because growing cultured meat seems to be far more difficult than [growing blood cells](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-63513330) from hematopoietic stem cells. It is preposterous to think cultured meat will become mainstream this decade or early next decade when there are still blood drives because the technology to produce blood cells at scale does not exist. [Producing blood](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-33270334) is an appropriate analogous process because both involve growing tissues from precursor cells *in vitro* as opposed to deriving the product, meat or blood, from a biological organism. Moreover, in order to have a disruptive effect on medicine or food consumption that it would eliminate the need for donated blood or massively curtail animal slaughter, these products would have to be mass produced.

[This article](https://thecounter.org/lab-grown-cultivated-meat-cost-at-scale/) goes into more depth about the problems of making lab-grown meat into a competitive commercial product. I think lab-grown meat will be like fusion power right now; it would not be a significant part of the world in the next 30 years, similar to how many people had thought many decades ago that fusion power would be viable by now.

2.

 World-wide carbon dioxide emissions. 

https://preview.redd.it/z1y66wcsimlb1.jpg?width=1022&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b52bccb58bbac31b15232f7806a4d4f4af5cc9fb

Agree with the pros here for 2025 and 2032. It is interesting the the pro forecasters predict that carbon dioxide emissions would be higher in 2025 than in 2023; moreover, they predict a smaller drop in 2032 vs 2023. I don't think the world has peaked yet for carbon dioxide emissions. Maybe 2026 or 2027. Renewable energy will take longer to roll out than the optimists say so that it can eclipse the growth in demand in China and India and cause a net displacement of fossil fuel power sources.

The renewable energy transition is a slow transition in the 2020s, not a profound disruption!

3.

 Energy consumption per capita in the world per annum. 

https://preview.redd.it/ow1xm8qe4nlb1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6c2acf75f11a55683a795fa10cc2cebb673c08aa

Discrepancies between pros and public for 2025 and 2033 are negligible. 80,000 kwh is the average energy consumption of the US. I think the world energy consumption in 2052 will be higher than the pros. I'll hazard to guess 35,000. Perhaps self-driving cars will increase energy used in travel due to higher volume of miles traveled, but electric vehicles uses less energy per mile. Massive desalination can boost energy consumption. Israel, for instance, uses 3,300 kwh (source, energy consumption per capita for Israel \[[https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/per-capita-energy-use](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/per-capita-energy-use)\] and the statistic that Israel uses 10 percent of its energy on desalination for 20 percent of its water \[[https://www.energymonitor.ai/tech/can-desalination-save-a-drying-world](https://www.energymonitor.ai/tech/can-desalination-save-a-drying-world) \]. For Israel complete desalination would 16,500 kwh.)

4.

Economic productivity per hour of labor in the US (in 2017 US dollars).

https://preview.redd.it/xyfvne100glb1.jpg?width=1020&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b3324980d8144cc67f74351f69549dfb47e40f09

The pro forecast rather reflect Robert Gordon's views on productivity growth extended for the next 30 years. 

Let's do some math to understand what the predictors are really predicting.

119.00/77.60 = 1.534

ln(1.534) = 0.428

0.428/30 = 0.0143 or 1.43 percent of growth per year.

Now, the public tournament forecasts double the growth as the pro-forecasters. So...

ln(2) = .7 (I didn't use a calculator, just the [rule of 70](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_72))

.7/30 = .0233

Hence, the public forecasters expect an additional 2.3 percent growth per year for a geometric average of 0.0376. This seems incredible, since it is more than average economic growth of the most recent boom years of 1996-2004.

What can feasible fuel economic growth in the subsequent decades? Surely, advanced robotics and human-level AI can achieve sustained economic growth for decades by fundamentally transforming society in a manner that electricity and indoor plumbing did. 

Another reason for technological optimism is the prospect that renewable energy transition will create a disruptive, new paradigm of abundant and cheaper clean energy that would not only allow us to maintain our current living standards but change our attitudes towards energy from the mindset of scarcity into abundance. For the purpose of the argument, I will assume that the renewable energy transition will occur on a relatively quick time scale in order to interrogate the effect of cheap renewable energy on productivity. Because of the new mindset of abundance, one would need not feel guilty about setting an air conditioner at 68 degrees Fahrenheit because the energy powering it would be cheap and clean. As I mention before, higher energy can allow a higher volume of travel with self-driving cars and extensive desalination. According to the EIA, [energy expenditures constituted 8% of US GDP](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=53620) in the early 2010s. What if that energy was actually free?  We can assume that $0.08 were spent for every dollar invested in productivity. Thus, it would seem that free energy would result in a boost in GDP of 8.7 percent (from the reciprocal of .92). If there is an abundance of renewable energy, it would not significantly contribute to GDP since energy intensive products, such as water to grow lawns in the desert or solo robotaxi rides in a Hummer-like electric vehicle, would be relatively cheap. Abundant cheap energy would certainly have deflationary influence, but that is partially accounted for by measuring hourly productivity in 2017 US dollars. Furthermore, Baumol's cost disease suggests that other items and services would not deflate just because energy became much cheaper, since productivity improves from some technology may not be able affect productivity in other activities. A teacher, for instance, cannot teach more students effectively just because faster CPUs and advanced telecommunication technology exists.  

5. 

FLOPS of the most powerful supercomputer

https://preview.redd.it/toi0ggki6nlb1.jpg?width=1014&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ee7e0e83beabad1c0b7c33327f2d06af68447000

Lastly, I will provide a reason for optimism as the pro-forecasts agree that the world's fastest supercomputer would be exponentially faster in 2052, as oppose to prediction catastrophic stagnation due to an anticipate secession of Moore's law. Both groups predict supercomputers to be more than one million times faster that the fastest supercomputer in 2023. As for 2023, the appropriate prefix for 10^(18)  scale computing is ""exa-"".

I think most scientific realists would acknowledge that atoms exist and have finite size as opposed to being infinitely divisible. Hence, transistors can no longer shrink further if they become a few atoms in width. Hopefully, Moore's law would continue on for several more decades if the computational substrate changes from the current silicon metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) to transitional metal dichalcogenides or carbon nanotubes. (See the slide from TSMC [here](https://www.anandtech.com/show/18873/tsmc-we-have-working-cfets-in-the-lab-but-they-are-generations-away).) The recent maturation of extreme ultraviolet lithography would enable Moore's law to continue on for perhaps another decade more.

I don't know if FLOPS specifically refers to FP32 or it can be FP16.

**Conclusion**

Going down the rabbit of futurism has ruined me. I see little to be optimistic about, but I do mainly myself for not thinking critically about the viability to artificial intelligence, generation iv reactors, and self-driving cars. It had left me broken because the false hope had been shattered. I regret that I am so deep down this rabbit hole that it hinders me from doing things that I enjoy such as playing Goat Format. My valedictory remarks will derive from the late coach Mike Leach:

\*\*\*\* you, f\*\*\* me, and f\*\*\* everybody. That is fucking b\*\*\*\*\*\*t. ([3:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZaOFTp5_C8&t=268s&ab_channel=AdamJacobi))

Introns:

ChatGPT and ""generative AI"" are particularly infuriating to me, since it seems like a pathetic picayune tchotchke compared to things that I enumerated. Generative AI seems like a pathetic consolation prize that I don't think will have a significant macroeconomic impact.  It cannot even perform a mundane task such as pick a ripe strawberry! As Paul of Pokemon would say, ""[pathetic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUyHk-CxgNY&ab_channel=rantoxdp54)"". I became infuriated that the video ""[Humans Need Not Apply](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU&ab_channel=CGPGrey)"" when it said in August 2014 that ""self-driving cars aren't the future; they're here and they work"" and ""it is easy to see them being better than humans because they are already are"". So it is not an emerging technology that will mature in some indeterminate point the future, but ready to hit the road right now.

I see technology progress and emerging technology to be similar to drug development where nothing is ""real"" until it has received an FDA approval. Mechanism of action doesn't really matter since molecular biology is an inscrutable enigma; what matters is to refute the null hypothesis that a pharmaceutical candidate has the same efficacy to a placebo or current standard of treatment. Large clinical (and expensive) trials that have enough statistical power to demonstrate a statistical significant  (but often marginal) benefit are the only way to refute null hypothesis. Due to the low success rate in getting a drug that has enter phase I to a full approval, clinical trials are Boulevard of Broken Dreams. [Eroom's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eroom%27s_law) is a microcosm of all emerging technology.

The only pleasant surprises during the last decade [was profound growth in utility solar power in California from 2012-2017](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_power_in_California#Generation), but that  actually hit an (actual) inflection point in 2018 (where the second derivative of the trend turned negative). It may start to accelerate again in California (and elsewhere). Lithium-ion batteries have also fallen substantially, but not enough for electric vehicles to become majority options right now. I outlined other significant gains in the 2010s that I consider ""significant"" [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/139qthg/comment/jm1vco8/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

I became sympathetic with redditor u/phoenix5869 because, while he significantly younger than me, shares a similarly assessment of technological progress:

16821nl,1,2023-09-02,Anki Guide,u/55736f70706572,JEENEETards,https://www.reddit.com/r/JEENEETards/comments/16821nl/anki_guide/,"# Q. What is Anki?

Anki is a popular and highly effective open-source flashcard software program designed to help users learn and remember information more efficiently. It uses a spaced repetition algorithm to optimize the timing of reviewing flashcards, making it a powerful tool for learning and retaining a wide range of knowledge, from languages and scientific facts to historical dates and more. Anki is particularly popular among students, language learners, and individuals seeking to memorize and retain information effectively/ It's available for multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android. ~~Thanks ChatGPT.~~ Did I mention it is **FREE** (not on iOS though)?

# Q. Why Anki?

Spaced memorization is an extremely powerful tool for memorization and flashcards are a convenient medium for the same. If you want to know more, this interactive website is awesome [https://ncase.me/remember/](https://ncase.me/remember/)!

# Q. How to Anki?

Anki is not your average app. It is not easy to get the hang of it right away. There is a slight learning curve at the start, and then it depends on how much further you want to enhance Anki via customization, statistics, etc. all of which are possible through the versatility of open-source. To get started,

* If you are a manual guy, [https://docs.ankiweb.net/#/](https://docs.ankiweb.net/#/)
* If you are an article guy, [https://leananki.com/how-to-use-anki-tutorial/](https://leananki.com/how-to-use-anki-tutorial/)
* Or if you are a YouTube guy like me, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmPx333n5UQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmPx333n5UQ).

Aside from these, I have some personal suggestions on how to use Anki efficiently and not waste a lot of time.

1. Use community decks [https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks](https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks) (more on this later). Don't make your own cards, unless you really have to. Many say that you should make your own cards, as it helps you to remember it better. I partially disagree, the main power of Anki comes from spaced repetition. If you really want to learn by actively making cards, good ol' pen and paper is a better way. Additionally, it is a huge time investment to make your own cards.
2. Trust the system, and avoid changing intervals. If a flashcard is set to be reviewed after 2 months, don't try to juke the algorithm and learn it after a week. Not only are you gonna decrease your review burden later on, but also retain it much better. This sounds counter-intuitive, but the algorithm has already got everything figured out.
3. Use all the four reviewing options—""Again"", ""Hard"", ""Good"", and ""Easy"". Some people only use the first and the last option, which is not optimal for the algorithm in my humble opinion.
4. Edit cards whenever you feel it's required. Not only is it much less demanding than making your own cards, but you will also gain the benefit of adding your own insight/information to that card. Try to keep everything as short as possible, which reminds me of my next point.
5. Don't. Make. Things. Long. Anki is not for reading, and it ought not to be used as such. छोटा पैकेट बड़ा धमाका |
6. Learn LaTeX. It's easy. Useful for mathematical formulas.

# Q. When to Anki?

Ideally, there should be sufficient time before your next major exam. If you are completely new to Anki, I suggest to not use it for JEE Mains 1st attempt, but you can get started if you have some free time and your preparation is going well.

# Q. Who uses Anki?

AIR 1. No, not me. Chirag Falor and a few of his friends. Other than them, I only know about one guy who had a rank under 1700, he used Anki extensively. I use it as well, helped me memorize the entire periodic table for the second time. It's power is really apparent to me, because back then (2019) it took me much more effort to memorize the PT without Anki and it was quite sloppy compared to now. There may be many out there who have used it though. Even more when you look outside the JEE space, it is especially popular among medical students.

I know its not a crazy 528, but its good enough for me and was a lot of effort. I'm a psych major and never took a single physics, bio, biochem, or orgo course. I only ever took introductory chemistry and the rest were psych courses. I'm going to be completely transparent with what I did the first go around, why it didn't work for me, and what I did the second go around! I'll also say this worked for me, it might not work for you, but if you work your butt off anyone can achieve this score. Finally, getting higher than 514 I truly believe is luck.

**Rewrite**

Okay so I'll preface this with what I purchased. I bought the 3 months of UPangea, all the AAMC stuff, the ANKI app and that's it. I did not use any of the textbooks from my original attempt. I got the Kaplan textbooks for free online at one of the many online websites you can get free textbooks. (PM me if you don't know). 

In total this attempt cost me roughly $600 in practice materials. $300 UPangea+$289 for AAMC materials+$25 for ANKI + fee to write. You have to consider the $600 as the fee to write unfortunately. The practice is important.

This time around I also worked in a restaurant two shifts a week (about 18 hours a week) plus volunteered twice a week (about 10 hours a week), I did stop doing a separate volunteer position twice a week to free up some additional time to study. I would pick up shifts here and there for extra money and to take breaks from studying!

I studied for a total of 5 months. It was too long. I think if I wrote a couple weeks earlier I would've gotten maybe 2 points higher, but hindsight is 20/20. I think for the average nontrad, four months is perfect. You need to stay committed to studying, but longer than four months you'll start to lose knowledge cause you've been holding onto so much new information for so long. Over the four months I've also lost friends. I missed wedding celebrations of family of close friends, I've missed close friends birthday parties and so much more, but the true friends stuck by me and kept following up, the fake ones stopped answering texts/calls and stopped reaching out. Being in a relationship any free time I spent on my gf. I will say in times I NEEDED to be there for someone I was. But for celebrations I unfortunately had to say I was busy. 

For the first month I read through the Kaplan textbooks. These are WAY better than the TPR textbooks for nontrads cause they explain everything much more simply. I read through all of them, no notes, no memorization and I just wanted to see if there were any concepts I didn't understand. This is when I learned what exactly is the active site of an enzyme. I didn't care to memorize all the details about it, I just wanted to learn what it is. Realistically, this was likely a waste of time since this could have been done with the anki deck I used instead.

The second month I did Anki, while finishing up the last couple of chapters of the Kaplan books. I did 50 new cards a day until the chapter were done, and then I did 100 new cards a day. If they were all simple I would add an extra 50 cards and do those. **If nothing else from this guide, please use the AnKing ANKI deck**. Its an updated Milesdown deck. Has all the information you need to know at the exact depth level you need to know it. It is the reason use see the jump from 503 to 513. Heres the link [https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschoolanki/comments/swjqzh/anking\_overhaul\_step\_1step\_2\_version\_11\_update/](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschoolanki/comments/swjqzh/anking_overhaul_step_1step_2_version_11_update/)

After the Anki deck was done and I had no new cards left I started practice. I did about 100 UPangea questions a day. If I got something wrong I made a new Anki card and reviewed them that night. Every Friday, I would redo all the wrong questions I got until I got them right. This took me a LONG time and so I only did 53% of UPangea. During this time every other day, or when it was slow at work/volunteering I would do the Anki cards that needed to be reviewed.

About a month and half out I stopped UPangea and started AAMC. I finished 100% of AAMC 2 days before my test. During this time I stopped Anki. Please learn from my mistake and keep up with Anki. I honestly was burnt out this last month and that's why you see me stagnate around 513.

All that said, I believe once you reach the 512 point, its becomes luck if you get higher or lower. When I got the 516 it felt exactly the same as when I got the 512. I only got 6 more questions right on the 516 then on the 512. So I got lucky on a couple educated guesses. Basically I found between FLs the subsections scores would be + or - 2 points, but always around 128. Sometimes I would get 130, sometimes 126. I found this to be especially true in CARS. Once you get to 127, basically every 2 questions is a point. If you guess right on 2 you get a 128, 2 more 129. At 129, its literally one question. I got a 132 on one of the FLs for CARS, I got 2 questions wrong, but it felt the exact same as all the other FLs. All I'm trying to say here is no one will admit it, but at the top scores it comes down to luck. On test day, my C/P section I got super unlucky with very heavy orgo content and in depth general chem questions. If I got more physics questions I would have probably gotten a 128 cause everyone said it was physics heavy so that's what I focused on. Its luck. At the top end so just try and be the most well rounded in all topics and you should be fine. 

Also, since I expect a handful of CARS questions there isn't a magical formula. As a Canadian I focused HEAVY on CARS my first go around. I went from a 122 to 127 on my first attempt to 128 this go around. The number one thing is find what works for you! I tried a million different approaches but what worked for me was questions first, then text, then answer in my head the question, then find the most similar option. I saw a post saying NEVER READ QUESTIONS FIRST so I stopped reading questions first. I went right back down to a 124. Do what works for you for CARS. What you have to do is learn how you understand what you read. And if you get to a 127 pray that you get lucky!

Finally, use chatGPT. It really is a godsend for explaining concepts. Just type ""explain to a five year old"" whatever you need explained. You can ever copy and paste passages into it and ask explain why this is the answer in simple terms. Be careful though because sometimes it will spit out bad information. So double check what it says. 

**What went wrong on the Original Attempt**

So for my original attempt, having decided to go into med late (my last year of undergrad) I had no idea what getting into med entailed. So I went to a TPR and Prep101 talk about the MCAT and medical school. I got a lot of information and looked into the MCAT, and came across a bunch of articles stating if you don't have the prerequisites you should take a prep course. So that's exactly what I did. I paid for the TPR 513+ guarantee or your money back (about $3600) and literally it would have been more useful to just burn the money for warmth. The lecturers sucked. They would read off a script, and would talk about stuff as if you already knew the info. I remember hearing about competitive inhibitors for the first time and the lecturer was talking about it as if it was common knowledge. And maybe it is common knowledge to premed, but I paid for this course because I wasn't a premed and needed these topics explained in depth. I also would ask clarifying questions and would be told ""Its cause thats what they do/ cause thats the answer"". It was frustrating and I thought I was the issue. They also used a TPR practice exam to gauge your original score, which they made EXTREMELY difficult, and then compare it to your actual score which is easier, and say hey we got you an 22 point jump, but that's just because my original score I got like 12 questions right on the entire test. Finally, there was a bunch of hoops to get the money back and I went trough all of them and was told ""no best we an do is continue your access to the online materials for another year."" Also it was so unpersonalized. I didn't need to sit through the 40 hours of psych content, I knew everything to know about psych content, I would've preffered time spent on bio/physics/chem.

TL:DR don't use prep companys. I didn't my second time around and did WAY better.

What I tried to do on top of the prep company was read the textbook constantly. It's what worked for me in undergrad so I thought it would for MCAT. The issue is I would read it but the MCAT is an application test, so I wouldn't practice it. So when a question came up about a topic I wouldn't know how to apply it, or because I didn't apply it I couldn't recall the information about the topic. For example, keeping with competitive inhibitors, I would push the x-intercept more left when it should go more right. Simple mistakes due to lack of content.

I barely used UPangea. I think in total I did about 400 questions. Yes I did a lot more of TPR stuff but UPangea really is the god of practice questions.

Finally, I didn't use AAMC materials. I instead used all of the TPR stuff because I wanted to ensure I would get my money back if I didn't get the score I wanted. If nothing else, spend the money on the AAMC materials. 

In total, the attempt probably cost me around $5500 CDN, if not more. I don't like to think about how much money I wasted on this attempt cause I thought if I pay for this stuff and do the bare minimum I'll be fine. Thats what I did in undergrad and got a decent cGPA (3.86), why would I need to change anything. As you can see from the test scores, I didn't retain any of the information. I got a 512 which is right around my FL average. 

So what went wrong is

1.  I didn't take it seriously. You need to commit to this exam 3 months in advance. And study for it as if your writing in a week the entire 3 months. If you do that, you'll get a good score. 
2. There are checklists to getting a good score. The only checklist item should be work hard and commit to studying.
3. Find you own weaknesses and work towards them. As non-trads its most likely that your issue is content. It wasn't until I was getting 90% of the free standing questions right that I realized I know my content, now focus on the understanding of questions/passages.

And that's really all I can think of. If you made it this far thanks for reading and I hope it helped a little bit and you saved some money. If you have questions ask here or send a pm. I'll answer ASAP!

168jzbr,1,2023-09-02,[A Levels] GP Paper 1 top tips!,u/addictivevenom,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/168jzbr/a_levels_gp_paper_1_top_tips/,"Hello!

Since a lot of you are about to take your year-end exams soon, here are some tips that you can keep in mind when revising for your Paper 1!

I have been a GP private tutor for many years, and these tips have been incredibly helpful for improving my students' performance for Paper 1, so hopefully you would find them useful too!

# Essay structure:

* Generally, I suggest adopting the following essay structure:

>Supporting  
>  
>Counterargument  
>  
>Rebuttal  
>  
>Supporting

I recommend this structure because it allows you to start and end your essay with strong arguments that convince the reader of your stance. The counterargument + rebuttal pair in the middle is then useful in adding nuance and complexity to your argument. Depending on the depth of your arguments, you can have more supporting paragraphs if needed, though the quality of your paragraphs is *always* more important than the quantity of them.

&#x200B;

* Regardless of your structure, ensure that the direction of your essay is clear throughout.

1. Stick to the same stance from start to finish.
2. Use appropriate connectors (eg critics may argue) to make clear how each paragraph contributes to your essay.

# Topic sentences

A clear and effective topic sentence is one that:

1. Directly addresses the question, and
2. Gives the reader a good idea of what you are going to discuss in your paragraph.

To achieve this, I recommend that each of your topic sentences contain the following three components:

1. Topic -- paraphrase of the question // link back to the question.
2. Cause -- your main point of the paragraph.
3. Effect -- the intermediate step between the Cause and the Topic.

For example, in response to the essay question *To what extent does social media pose a challenge to governance?*, a topic sentence could be

>Social media poses a challenge to governance **\[topic\]** because it can be used to rally together dissenters who wish to challenge the government’s authority **\[cause\]**, making it difficult for the government to garner enough popular support to successfully implement its policies **\[effect\]**.

Having these three elements allows your topic sentence to act as a skeleton of your paragraph, which is helpful not only for your reader to understand your argument, but also for you to have a clear idea of what logical links you need to make in your explanation/evaluation.

Of course, as you become more proficient in essay writing, you can switch these elements around, or increase the complexity of your topic sentence by having multiple Effects.

# Explanation/evaluation

Simply put, your explanation/evaluation is what leads you from your Cause, to your Effect, and finally back to the Topic (i.e. the essay question). It is also how you link your examples/evidence to your main argument.

We can see the explanation/evaluation of your paragraph as a logical chain from A --> B --> C --> D.

The main problem most students face with their explanation/evaluation is logical gaps in their argument. Take a look at this passage written by one of my students:

>As explained in an article published by the New York Times, researchers prompted the ChatGPT AI chatbot to write in the voice of disinformation spreaders such as Alex Jones and Joseph Mercola. The responses did not disprove the claims of these disinformation spreaders but instead framed them as truths.  
>  
>Therefore, AI chatbots have the ability to bolster the false claims of existing disinformation spreaders as well as exacerbate the spread of fake news websites and articles, creating even more confusion amongst news readers in identifying reliable news sources.

The most glaring logical gap in this passage is the missing link between 'The responses did not disprove the claims of these disinformation spreaders but instead framed them as truths', and 'exacerbate the spread of fake news websites and articles'. Just because AI chatbots parrot disinformation rather than correct it, does not necessarily/immediately lead to fake news spreading more widely/rapidly. There is the unexplained assumption that these AI chatbots that parrot disinformation are used in the generation of fake news articles or posts.

Logical gaps like this greatly weaken your argument, as it leaves the reader with a lot of doubt about how you actually arrived at your main point.

If your paragraphs often contain logical gaps, this is what you can do:

1. When writing essay outlines, rather than writing your explanation/evaluation in paragraph form, write it either as a logical chain (A --> B --> C --> D) or in point form, with one premise in each point.
2. After finishing your paragraph, read your explanation, and ask yourself: *Does A necessarily/immediately lead to B? Is there a missing link between A and B that I need to explain further?*
3. If you have friends and teachers who are willing to assess your work, you can ask them to check whether the logical links you have made are sufficiently explained or make sense. It is usually easier to spot logical gaps in someone else's writing (especially if you don't agree with their argument) than in your own!

# Evidence/examples

Even though you cannot do without evidence/examples in your essay, they are not the key to doing well for Paper 1; having a strong, cogent argument is. Therefore, you should not spend too much time cramming years' worth of current affairs into your head right before your exam. Instead, adopt these strategies to make full use of the knowledge that you already have:

* When deciding which examples to memorise, choose ones that are more versatile (i.e. ones that can be cited in multiple questions across multiple topics) over those that are very niche (e.g. a statistic that can only be used to back up a single point).

An example of a versatile case study is Japan's release of the Fukushima nuclear waste water into the Pacific Ocean. This case study is obviously relevant for Environment questions, such as those that ask about energy or pollution. On top of that though, it can also be applied to Politics questions about diplomacy or trade. You can consider why some countries such as China decided to ban Japanese seafood import, while other countries did not. This case study is also applicable to Media questions, as you can discuss how different news agencies reported on the event, and how key stakeholders (e.g. Japanese fishermen) responded to the news, to talk about truth vs sensationalism, or about our post-truth world.

* When writing essays or essay outlines for practice, rely less on Google, and more on your creativity.

When students do practices for Paper 1, they often have their devices at the ready to Google for evidence/examples to substantiate their points. This is not the best way to revise, especially nearing your exams, however, as it would lead to you having many separate nuggets of content that you won't be able to remember for your exams. Rather than immediately turning to Google when you need something to substantiate your argument, think about the examples that you already have in your head, and whether they can be *re-angled* to support your point.

It does not matter if the example by itself does not directly back up your point -- that is ideal, but often not possible to achieve under exam conditions. That is what your evaluation is for -- to infer from the example, and use those logical inferences to *link* your example to your point.

&#x200B;

After applying these two tips, you should experience less pressure to memorise lots of examples right before your exam. You can use the time that you have freed up to (1) read for arguments and perspectives, and to (2) work on more important skills, like forming logical and evaluative arguments, and writing in a fluent and engaging manner.

&#x200B;

That's all I have for Paper 1! Do let me know if this was helpful, and feel free to DM me if you have any questions, or if you would like me to look through your practices.

All the best for your exams! :)",active,127
168ulpu,1,2023-09-03,Suggestions and Insights For Self Study?,u/Revolutionary_Lock57,GetStudying,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetStudying/comments/168ulpu/suggestions_and_insights_for_self_study/,"Hallo!

Question:
So,I'd like tips, views perspectives of how I can stricture my day/week/month (s) for a  successful SELF-STUDY over the course (pun intended) of several months, emulating ""semesters""

Background:
I finished University many years ago, (before audiobooks were a thing), a lil over 10 years ago, yet always enjoyed learning.  One of my pet peeves of University was not having the ""time"" to study and learn more of what I wanted, in other words, like having a schedule full of electives, instead of my major.  Naturally, that's not practical if your aiming for a specific degree etc.

I've always had the idea of creating my own self study program.  Now, years later, I have the time (free time) and resources (plenty of books, youtube/other public lectures/ apps etc to make this happen.

My Delimna:
Structure.  Having been removed fromthe University world, it's Luke I ""forgot"" how to study.  Plus, with the technology listed above (apps etc), I'm sure I can really organize my study plan better. But, again, it's overwhelmingly, overwhelming in the directions or approach I can go;

How often/how many hours per week do you usually invest ""learning/in class""?

How often/how many hours per week do you usually invest in ""self study"" (ie in dorms/home/library)?

Do you take notes, then read them over and over again until learned?

How often/how many hours per week do you usually invest in leisure time, for balance?

Any apps that you use?

The subject matters, may not matter, but for informational purposes, my topics of choice are theological studies, and something else completely  different (probably advancing my Spanish; self taught also, almost fluent - I use ChatGPT for this)

I hope these aren't dumb questions. I just need  a students' (or anyone thst can help) perspectives.

Do you currently use any AI tools?,u/A1powerranger,ScienceTeachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/ScienceTeachers/comments/16a91zo/how_are_you_navigating_the_impact_of_ai_in_the_ed/,"The current AI edtech landscape is pretty wild. AI-driven tools are already creating a massive impact in classroom management and professional development. From automated grading systems to personalized learning platforms, AI is streamlining learning at an unprecedented rate. 

Most people in my academic circle are already fully integrated and automating most administrative tasks, lecture transcription , tutoring, and more.

**Interesting use cases I’ve come across:**

ScribeSense: Amplifying Accessibility ScribeSense, an AI-powered transcription tool, has revolutionized classroom accessibility. It provides real-time transcriptions of lectures, aiding both students with hearing impairments and teachers seeking to review and refine their instructional approaches.

Studdy.ai: Enhanced learning powered by AI, Studdy has a very unique approach to learning. Unlike chatgpt, photomath,  and other AI tutors that are built to spit out results, Studdy is an immersive alternative walking users through all the steps and permutations leading to the outcome. One of the only applications of AI assisted learning that seems complimentary to student development.

&#x200B;

**Expert opinions worth considering** 

Experts emphasise that AI should be seen as a tool that augments teachers' capacities rather than replaces them. Dr. Sugata Mitra, Professor of Educational Technology at Newcastle University, underscores that AI can address educational inequalities and support teachers in more effectively engaging diverse learners.

&#x200B;

**Adoption strategies for AI-assisted-learning**

I believe that educators need comprehensive training to effectively integrate AI tools into their teaching practices. (there’s a palpable knowledge gap here).

While we’re at it, why not push for professional development programs focused on fostering AI literacy and pedagogical innovation??

&#x200B;

**I firmly believe that AI's role in education is not one of substitution but augmentation with immense collaborative potential.** 

&#x200B;

Are you currently using AI tools? How has AI impacted your day to day?

16am4p0,1,2023-09-05,"Y'all are 1,000% right, I was lying to myself, the systems completely broken",u/TheRed_Knight,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/16am4p0/yall_are_1000_right_i_was_lying_to_myself_the/,"IDK this is allowed as I'm not a teacher, but I didn't know where else to post this

I started working as a private tutor part time about a year ago, tutoring some of my nieces/nephews and their friends.  I knew kinda shit was bad, I have couple teachers in my social circle, but I thought they were exaggerating or hyperbolizing, theres no way it could be that bad right?  After experiencing it first hand for a year, holy fuck, it's an indescribable, existential horror show, I was completely, utterly, and unequivocally wrong.  Some of the concerning trends I've noticed, and just for reference the kids I tutor are mostly from high COL areas who attend either private schools or ""good"" public institutions, these are on paper good students, with robust at home support systems and education tools, many of them are straight A students.  

-Severely underdeveloped critical thinking skills , they're pretty damn good at absorbing and regurgitating information but beyond that, oof, this leads to all sorts of issue, such as inability to make long form or complex arguments, not understanding how pieces of information are linked together because they aren't explicitly stated to be connected, extreme difficulty problem solving when they don't have all the variable, parsing information etc.  The worst parts that when I can work with them and get them to buy in, you can see the long atrophied gears turning in their heads, and they start to get a little excited as they can do shit on their own, but 1-3 hours a week isnt enough time to undo over a decade of mental neglect. 

-Degraded mental stamina, they struggle to get through 30 straight minutes of instruction without needing frequent breaks, especially for the goddamned phones, if they aren't super into the material, and for whatever reason they seem to expect to be constantly entertained by tutoring

-No resilience, they give up at the slightest challenge or adversity and look to me for answers, when I don't give it to them they get all weird and look at me like I'm some kind of asshole

-Grammar is dead, lmao

-They treat google like the word of god and will copy/paste the first answer that pops up, even if its obviously wrong

-Extreme tech reliance without more than a paltry understanding of it, they're fucking wizards at navigating touch screen UI's but have no idea how they work, or how to function without them. They also just don't know how to use computers, at all, they're as bad as boomers in that regard, ask them to find the documents or downloads folders and you might as well be speaking an alien language to them

-Dexterity issues for non-athletes, they have a hard time doing anything tactile and tend to fumble or drop shit, also have issues with physical books

-They don't give a shit about deadlines, the amount of times I've had one of them stop giving a fuck and give me the ""I'll just turn it in whenever"" is too damn high.  Also too many safety nets, being able to turn assignments in whenever for full credit, open note exams, unmonitored take home exams, being able to make up any assignment as many times as they want until they get the grade they want isn't healthy for childhood development, how will you grow if you aren't allowed to fail?

-Curriculum has been dumbed down, compared to when I was in high schools its about two grades (EX: the kind of work I did as a freshmen is roughly on par with the workload juniors have today, AP's not withstanding) and they still struggle with it

-A lot of them are way less literate than they should, they can skim information pretty well but they retain very little of it

-ChatGPT use is rampant, especially for writing assignements

-Fuck tiktok, that shits a digital weapon designed to rot kids brains out

And probably more, I really fucking hope that this is just some weird local phenomena because otherwise, we as a society are even more fucked.  We aren't passing down critical cognitive skills to future generations, for perhaps the first time in modern history, which has led to a generation of kids being, on average, that has a weaker foundation than their predecessors.  And that isn't to say this affects every student equally, I have several who are an absolute treat to work with, and in no way, shape, or form is this the fault of teachers, but in general shits bad, and it looks like it's only going to get worse.  

TLDR: We're turning kids into the pod people from WALL-E and it ain't the teachers fault",active,3074

16ap9p8,1,2023-09-05,DataAnalyst.com - I launched a niche job board with hand curated data analyst jobs.

Want to make sure I document the journey, and keep myself honest, so each month I will be making a post about the statistics, progress, some thoughts and what are the next steps I want to be focusing on.

While the main purpose for the post is to bring everyone along on the journey, I do think that members of r/datascience might benefit from the site, especially those looking for a new data analyst job. I'd also love to engage with people on the sub who'd like to share their data analyst career journey.

So, just a reminder that early stages vision is to become the #1 job board for data analysts - hand-picking interesting data analyst job opportunities across industries.

Let's dive right in:

# 1. General Observations

DataAnalyst.com has been online for just over 8 months, and we're bringing new, hand curated data analyst jobs onto the site daily - all of them including a salary range.

There's now 1,800+ people subscribed to the newsletter, and I can't thank you enough for your support and for joining us on the journey.

## First job paid posting

To those who monitor the above table closely, you've probably noticed the number 1 in the paid posts cell for August.

Yes, it ***only*** took 7 months and 16 days to get a first paid job posting on the site. Hurray!

Tualatin Valley Fire & Rescue purchased a fast-track job posting - it came organically, which is a great sign as well.

It also came in with a lesson learnt - after tweaking flows / forms, always double check that you didn't leave a bug behind. Unfortunately for me I did, and they couldn't complete the purchase, but fortunately they reached out and I solved the issue immediately. I've also upgraded the posting to a featured one, free of charge - I think this is particularly important.

Linkedins, Indeeds of the world are too complex to ensure a human connection with each client, while as a solofounder, I want to make sure I go over and beyond each time someone puts trusts in me and the service. That's something I do believe founders should strive for, and something that will set them apart.

## Stats - Bounce, numbers, bounce

After seeing a massive dip in traffic, apply now clicks and Google impressions in July, looks like August numbers bounced back with vengeance, driven primarily by skyrocketing Google impressions / clicks.

I'd be grateful if someone could please explain to me Google Search Console Clicks vs Google Analytics Visitors - shouldn't each click that comes from Google Search, leading to the site, also mean that's a visitor coming in?

**Where did 4,421 people come from?**

* Direct - 51%
* Organic - 35%
* Social - 14% (automated job postings on Twitter, Linkedin, Reddit)

**SEO optimisation**

I've also spent some time over the summer using tools such as SEMRush / Ahrefs / Moz to run some high level audits and understand how the site performs on the SEO front. This led to a lot of time spent on making significant on-page changes to improve keyword optimisation, rewriting meta descriptions and adding alt descriptions to all the images on the site.

Whether this was something that caused the sudden Google love, I don't know, but this is probably something that could (and should) have been done a lot earlier. Having said that, it's now something that I pay attention to with each update that I make on the site.

## Things on top of my mind

**a) Expired Listings**

There's feedback regarding some of the jobs on the site already expiring and leading to non-existing listings. Decided to address this in two ways:

First, I found out Ahrefs has a free ""Site Audit"" tier, which crawls the whole site and provides a report including all the issues i.e missing alt descriptions, including 404 links.

Second, on each listing I've now included a link for any visitor to report an expiring listing. Hopefully this will improve the experience. I'm still leaving listings (without apply buttons) on the site, so people can see previous open roles and salary ranges.

**b) Outreach**

One of my main priorities for the coming 3 months is reaching out to organisations hiring data analysts and educating them about the niche job board, and how they can benefit by sharing their opportunities on the site.

Additionally, I did notice quite a few .edu emails signed up to the Newsletter. This could be an interesting angle to explore, reaching out to universities, sharing that their students are using the site. This could lead to both driving in visitors, as well as potentially getting a backlink that would help increase the authority of the site.

**c) UX/UI**

Lesson learnt - do not use experimental browsers when you try to do website design - I've been using Arc browser since the start of the year, with the toolbar being on the left hand side. I've recently used various browsers and monitors to see how the site looks on various sizes, and it's an absolute mess -> will need to dedicate some time to standardize sections and elements, so it's a more consistent experience.

## BusinessAnalyst.com

As I've mentioned before, I recently launched BusinessAnalyst.com - where I'm looking to replicate step by step what I've done over the last 8 months with DataAnalyst. The overall idea is to create a network of sites, benefiting from the same infrastructure, serving and helping different career paths, and making a collaboration with organisations much more appealing (afterall, most companies who hire for data analysts also look for business analysts and vice versa). Arguably, this might not make much sense seeing that DA still hasn't brought any consistent revenue in, but on the other hand, I can reuse the whole tech stack and structures already in place, halve my cost per project, while doubling the surface area to catch me some luck.

Shared [first update](https://www.reddit.com/r/businessanalyst/comments/15r5ecq/businessanalystcom_i_launched_a_niche_job_board/) couple of weeks ago - will need to figure out how to combine, if people are interested to see the side by side view. **TLDR: site still dead**

# 2. ""Day in the Life"" - a series of interviews with data analysts sharing their experience, thoughts and advice.

Another interview from our series has been published. In these interviews, we aim to share stories and experiences about the route to becoming a data analyst, keeping up with the skillset, recommendations to aspiring data analysts and much more.

**Alex, who is a BI manager at AWS**, has shared some fantastic insights, and I'd love to share his  advice on building a portfolio.

*""I've been mentoring a few folks on this recently, ranging from college grads to mid-career individuals in non-tech roles. My recommendation to each is to build an end to end portfolio of work. An example is using python to web scrape information from a website and persist to a normalized data structure in a database, using SQL to write queries and analyze that information, and then use Tableau or PowerBI to visualize results and share insights. Each step of this process is important for a rockstar Data Analyst/BI Engineer and will showcase the capability to do the work for hiring managers.""*

We also briefly cover the question of the Year: Is AI/ChatGPT a threat to data analysts? Highly recommend reading the [full interview](https://www.dataanalyst.com/blog/alex-my-data-analyst-career-journey).

# Things in the pipeline

* New data analyst jobs, added daily
* Actually launching the weekly newsletter with the pick of best jobs directly to your inbox (yes, I know....)
* Monthly US data analyst market insights
* Improving the overall site experience (this one is a never ending activity)
* Continuing to bring you Data Analysts across their experience levels, to share tips, tricks and their thoughts

# 3 ways you could help

1. Looking for a new challenge? Check out the website - I'm adding new jobs daily
2. Looking to hire a data analyst to your team? Do you know anyone looking to hire? Shoot me a message on Reddit (or [alex@dataanalyst.com](mailto:alex@dataanalyst.com)) and I'll upgrade your first listing for free!
3. As I mentioned, we have an ongoing ""Day of a Data Analyst"" series. For those of you who are open to do an email based interview about your data analyst career journey, please just send me a message and we'll organise something - would love to get you featured and share your experience with our readers! Also, as I thank you I will donate to a charity of your choice.

If you have any questions, concerns, come across glitches - please just reach out, happy to chat. Thank you all again, and see you in a month. Alex",removed,19

DataAnalyst.com has been online for just over 8 months, and we're bringing new, hand curated data analyst jobs onto the site daily - all of them including a salary range.

There's now 1,800+ people subscribed to the newsletter, and I can't thank you enough for your support and for joining us on the journey.

## First job paid posting

To those who monitor the above table closely, you've probably noticed the number 1 in the paid posts cell for August.

Yes, it ***only*** took 7 months and 16 days to get a first paid job posting on the site. Hurray!

Tualatin Valley Fire & Rescue purchased a fast-track job posting - it came organically, which is a great sign as well.

It also came in with a lesson learnt - after tweaking flows / forms, always double check that you didn't leave a bug behind. Unfortunately for me I did, and they couldn't complete the purchase, but fortunately they reached out and I solved the issue immediately. I've also upgraded the posting to a featured one, free of charge - I think this is particularly important.

Linkedins, Indeeds of the world are too complex to ensure a human connection with each client, while as a solofounder, I want to make sure I go over and beyond each time someone puts trusts in me and the service. That's something I do believe founders should strive for, and something that will set them apart.

## Stats - Bounce, numbers, bounce

After seeing a massive dip in traffic, apply now clicks and Google impressions in July, looks like August numbers bounced back with vengeance, driven primarily by skyrocketing Google impressions / clicks.

I'd be grateful if someone could please explain to me Google Search Console Clicks vs Google Analytics Visitors - shouldn't each click that comes from Google Search, leading to the site, also mean that's a visitor coming in?

**Where did 4,421 people come from?**

* Direct - 51%
* Organic - 35%
* Social - 14% (automated job postings on Twitter, Linkedin, Reddit)

**SEO optimisation**

I've also spent some time over the summer using tools such as SEMRush / Ahrefs / Moz to run some high level audits and understand how the site performs on the SEO front. This led to a lot of time spent on making significant on-page changes to improve keyword optimisation, rewriting meta descriptions and adding alt descriptions to all the images on the site.

Whether this was something that caused the sudden Google love, I don't know, but this is probably something that could (and should) have been done a lot earlier. Having said that, it's now something that I pay attention to with each update that I make on the site.

## Things on top of my mind

**a) Expired Listings**

There's feedback regarding some of the jobs on the site already expiring and leading to non-existing listings. Decided to address this in two ways:

First, I found out Ahrefs has a free ""Site Audit"" tier, which crawls the whole site and provides a report including all the issues i.e missing alt descriptions, including 404 links.

Second, on each listing I've now included a link for any visitor to report an expiring listing. Hopefully this will improve the experience. I'm still leaving listings (without apply buttons) on the site, so people can see previous open roles and salary ranges.

**b) Outreach**

One of my main priorities for the coming 3 months is reaching out to organisations hiring data analysts and educating them about the niche job board, and how they can benefit by sharing their opportunities on the site.

Additionally, I did notice quite a few .edu emails signed up to the Newsletter. This could be an interesting angle to explore, reaching out to universities, sharing that their students are using the site. This could lead to both driving in visitors, as well as potentially getting a backlink that would help increase the authority of the site.

**c) UX/UI**

Lesson learnt - do not use experimental browsers when you try to do website design - I've been using Arc browser since the start of the year, with the toolbar being on the left hand side. I've recently used various browsers and monitors to see how the site looks on various sizes, and it's an absolute mess -> will need to dedicate some time to standardize sections and elements, so it's a more consistent experience.

## BusinessAnalyst.com

As I've mentioned before, I recently launched BusinessAnalyst.com - where I'm looking to replicate step by step what I've done over the last 8 months with DataAnalyst. The overall idea is to create a network of sites, benefiting from the same infrastructure, serving and helping different career paths, and making a collaboration with organisations much more appealing (afterall, most companies who hire for data analysts also look for business analysts and vice versa). Arguably, this might not make much sense seeing that DA still hasn't brought any consistent revenue in, but on the other hand, I can reuse the whole tech stack and structures already in place, halve my cost per project, while doubling the surface area to catch me some luck.

Shared [first update](https://www.reddit.com/r/businessanalyst/comments/15r5ecq/businessanalystcom_i_launched_a_niche_job_board/) couple of weeks ago - will need to figure out how to combine, if people are interested to see the side by side view. **TLDR: site still dead**

# 2. ""Day in the Life"" - a series of interviews with data analysts sharing their experience, thoughts and advice.

Another interview from our series has been published. In these interviews, we aim to share stories and experiences about the route to becoming a data analyst, keeping up with the skillset, recommendations to aspiring data analysts and much more.

**Alex, who is a BI manager at AWS**, has shared some fantastic insights, and I'd love to share his  advice on building a portfolio.

*""I've been mentoring a few folks on this recently, ranging from college grads to mid-career individuals in non-tech roles. My recommendation to each is to build an end to end portfolio of work. An example is using python to web scrape information from a website and persist to a normalized data structure in a database, using SQL to write queries and analyze that information, and then use Tableau or PowerBI to visualize results and share insights. Each step of this process is important for a rockstar Data Analyst/BI Engineer and will showcase the capability to do the work for hiring managers.""*

We also briefly cover the question of the Year: Is AI/ChatGPT a threat to data analysts? Highly recommend reading the [full interview](https://www.dataanalyst.com/blog/alex-my-data-analyst-career-journey).

# Things in the pipeline

* New data analyst jobs, added daily
* Actually launching the weekly newsletter with the pick of best jobs directly to your inbox (yes, I know....)
* Monthly US data analyst market insights
* Improving the overall site experience (this one is a never ending activity)

16aym6s,1,2023-09-05,Penn States Ranking in Forbes Best Colleges of 2023,u/Relative_Session_179,PennStateUniversity,https://www.reddit.com/r/PennStateUniversity/comments/16aym6s/penn_states_ranking_in_forbes_best_colleges_of/,"Ladies and gentlemen,

I stand before you today, not as a critic, but as a fervent advocate for the cause of education and the recognition of excellence, echoing my own dream for equality and justice. I express my deep concern at the recent ranking of Penn State, a place brimming with immense promise and potential, as a mere 408th in Forbes' list of top colleges for 2023. This placement fails to capture the true essence and value of this esteemed institution.

Penn State is not just another educational institution; it is a beacon of hope and opportunity. It is a place where the seeds of knowledge are sown, and the dreams of countless individuals take root. Let us not be swayed by rankings alone, for they often fall short of revealing the complete narrative. Instead, let us delve deeper into the compelling reasons why Penn State unquestionably deserves a higher standing.

First and foremost, Penn State boasts an astonishing array of over 275 undergraduate majors. This extensive selection signifies an unwavering commitment to diversity in learning, ensuring that every student can fervently pursue their passions. Such a rich academic offering undeniably merits a higher place in the academic hierarchy.

Furthermore, the median salary of Penn State graduates, a formidable $119,500, stands as a testament to the university's unwavering dedication to preparing students for success. It illuminates that Penn State is not merely an institution of knowledge but an incubator of practical skills and capabilities, equipping its students to thrive in the real world.

While the national graduation rate in America stands at 65%, Penn State proudly boasts an 89% graduation rate. This remarkable accomplishment underscores the university's steadfast commitment to guiding its students towards not only academic completion but also prosperity. With over 750,000 accomplished alumni, Penn State's ability to nurture and support its graduates is evident for all to see.

Moreover, Penn State offers an astonishing array of opportunities beyond the classroom. With over 1,000 student organizations and 29 varsity sports, it empowers students to explore their passions and evolve into well-rounded individuals. This emphasis on holistic development is a hallmark of an institution dedicated to nurturing not only the mind but also the spirit.

In comparing Penn State to other esteemed institutions, one cannot help but notice the parity in research and academic reputation. Schools like UC Berkeley, Cornell, and Michigan, ranked significantly higher by Forbes, share similar attributes with Penn State. This underscores that Penn State deserves its rightful place among the nation's elite institutions.

In conclusion, I implore you, dear applicants, to evaluate Penn State not solely based on its numerical ranking, but on the vast potential it holds, the dreams it fosters, and the futures it shapes. Let us not be defined by the judgments of others but rather by the boundless possibilities that Penn State offers. In the spirit of progress and equity, let us unite to ensure that Penn State's true essence shines brilliantly in the annals of higher education. Together, we can herald a brighter future for this distinguished institution

16b3s51,1,2023-09-05,Speech About Forbes Ranking,u/MarketingIsCool2,PennStateUniversity,https://www.reddit.com/r/PennStateUniversity/comments/16b3s51/speech_about_forbes_ranking/,"  

As a proud Penn State alumnus, I want to share why you should consider attending Penn State, regardless of its Forbes ranking. While it is true that Forbes currently ranks Penn State at number 408, I want to emphasize that this ranking does not reflect the true value and potential of our university. Here are some compelling reasons to look beyond rankings and consider Penn State as your future home:

Firstly, it is important to recognize that there are multiple university rankings around the world, and Penn State performs much better in other respected rankings. For instance, the U.S. News and World Report ranks Penn State at 77th in the country. Additionally, two other reputable reports place the school at 53rd and 83rd internationally. These rankings are based on objective measures that are not always publicly disclosed, meaning that each ranking has its own unique criteria. This diversity of rankings highlights that Penn State's position can fluctuate based on different aspects considered, making it unwise to solely rely on one ranking.

Secondly, Penn State boasts an incredible alumni network, one of the largest in the world. This network spans across various industries and provides valuable connections to current and former students. It opens doors for career opportunities, mentorship, and networking, even years after graduation. Penn State also offers specialized job boards to connect alumni, fostering a tight-knit community that contributes to the university's growth and success. Moreover, alumni often reinvest in the local economy, particularly during events like our cherished traditions in State College, Pennsylvania.

Speaking of traditions, Penn State is renowned for its rich history and vibrant culture. While we may not be the oldest college in the state, we are undoubtedly one of the most prominent. Our academic and athletic achievements have made us a household name. Our strong athletic record draws crowds to Beaver Stadium from across the country, creating a sense of unity and excitement. But our traditions go beyond tailgating and football. The Penn State Creamery, famous for its iconic ice cream flavors like Peachy Paterno, is a must-visit. And then there's THON, the largest student-led philanthropy in the world. THON not only entertains students but also fights childhood cancer through support for the Four Diamonds Fund. Penn State consistently gives back to its community through educational programs and significant donations.

In conclusion, I urge you to look beyond Forbes' ranking and consider Penn State for its remarkable alumni network, rich traditions, and the recognition it receives from other reputable sources. Our university offers a world of opportunities and a vibrant community that extends far beyond a number on a list. Penn State is a place where you can truly thrive and make a lasting impact.

16b6zh2,1,2023-09-05,Cheating,u/itzmoepi,aiwars,https://www.reddit.com/r/aiwars/comments/16b6zh2/cheating/,"Today we will cover AI cheating, because it's likely 90% of students won't do their own homework ever again.

[https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/theres-no-way-for-teachers-to-figure-out-if-students-are-using-chatgpt-to-cheat-openai-says-in-new-back-to-school-guide/ar-AA1g5JYg](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/theres-no-way-for-teachers-to-figure-out-if-students-are-using-chatgpt-to-cheat-openai-says-in-new-back-to-school-guide/ar-AA1g5JYg) 

OpenAI released the ultimate cheating tool that is also very hard to detect (without a ton of false positives). I'm sure that ChatGPT can solve basically every homework problem up to high school and at least a portion of college-level assignments. 

Now first, I should establish why making ChatGPT do all your homework *is* cheating, because pro-ai people will argue that it's just a ""tool"" and that ""prompts"" still require effort to make. 

The problem with AI isn't even that it's plagiarism (even though it certainly is), but just the simple fact that it's not *you* doing the work and learning the material.

I want you to imagine that you are back in middle school but you have an older sibling who's in college, and when you don't understand a homework assignment you ask them for help. Using ChatGPT to do your homework would be like asking that older sibling to do all your work for you while you go and play on the PS5 or something. Why is that bad? **Because you're not actually learning any of the material, defeating the entire point of homework.** 

There is going to be a negative correlation between how capable AI becomes with the intelligence of the general population; as AI becomes smarter humans will get dumber. If students cheat their way throughout school it will literally make future generations of humans dumber since they won't be learning much at all of what they are being taught.

The only application of AI that may not be awful is an educational setting is making it automatically grade tests, but this is only for teachers to aid in a mundane task of their job and not for students. I don't see any benefits to having students use AI to make it do all their work for them.

I have yet to see one benefit of generative AI text that isn't to help cheaters and spammers. What even is a legitimate use case people have for this? I certainly don't want to read any AI-generated articles, books, or comments. If you care so little about your message that you didn't even bother writing it yourself, then similarly why should I care enough to bother reading? The same applies to AI art also, why should I care to look at images you didn't even bother making yourself? I'd much rather read or look at content made by a five year old that was made by them instead of AI crap.

I think AI should get banned in schools, enabling cheating benefits no one and will yield a negative on society.",User_deleted,0

They completely denied using AI and then ignored the most substantial part of my comments and focused only on the fact that I don’t have a specific AI policy in my syllabus. They start emailing my chair and others while I’m still in lecture thinking they have a trump card.
Firstly, it’s not against any rules. My industry is going to be heavily effected by AI so we are embracing it- many of our projects involve AI. But you used AI to make something so completely wrong!

On my last two assignments I've had 3 (out of 4) students turn in code that I was suspicious of\* (see below) - so my questions for fellow programming professors are:  


&#x200B;

1) What amount of ""proof"" would you be looking for before you decide that a student cheated on an assignment? I'm the only programming instructor at my institution - so I'll need to be able to explain this to people who aren't familiar with the field. 

  
2) Any suggestions for making assignments ChatGPT-resistant?  


&#x200B;

\*What tipped me off:  
Three students submitted nearly identical code that:

1) Created an unnecessary class that wasn't asked for by the assignment. We've only had one lecture on creating classes. Why would they all create the same/similar unnecessary class?

2) Created several supporting functions. This would be good coding practices - but I'm suspicious that it's ""too good"" to be true. I'm additionally suspicious that the students miraculously came up with the same names for these supporting functions.

3) Implemented an ""if \_\_main\_\_  ==""\_\_\_name\_\_"":"" - this was unnecessary for the assignment and actually makes the overall assignment not run correctly. We haven't discussed this aspect of python at all yet.

4) They all wrote a weird loop: ""for \_ in range(n):"" That underscore is technically legal syntax and could be justified by PEP-8 standards - but it's odd and certainly not something we've discussed in class. The textbook doesn't seem to do this anywhere either. Again, this is an issue of ""Why would they all do the same weird thing in the same way at the same place?""

5) They correctly programmed the ""hard"" parts but not the ""easy"" parts that are necessary to tailor a general solution to the actual assignment (e.g. they successfully traversed a linked list and deleted nodes, but didn't actually do the comparison they were asked to make). They again, all made the same mistake.

  
Of course, I then copied my prompt into ChatGPT and its output was nearly identical to what was turned in. There was some variation, but I'd estimate there was at least an 80% overlap between what ChatGPT gave me and between each of these student assignments. ",active,22

It’s constantly bringing in new features, products, and ideas to optimize AI for the future. Here’s a quick rundown of OpenAI’s recent activities and achievements.  


* **ChatGPT-4 diagnosed a 1 in 100,000 condition in seconds**  
\- Dr. Isaac Kohane, a physician and computer scientist at Harvard, has tested the newest artificial intelligence model, GPT-4, in a medical setting. According to his findings, GPT-4 performs better than many doctors, as it can answer medical exam licensing questions correctly more than 90% of the time, translate information for patients, and give doctors helpful suggestions about bedside manner.  
\- Kohane tested GPT-4 on a real-life case and found that it could correctly diagnose a rare condition just as he would with all his years of experience. However, GPT-4 isn't always reliable, and his latest book ‘The AI Revolution in Medicine’ is filled with examples of its blunders, ranging from clerical errors to math mistakes.  
\- Kohane is both impressed and horrified, as he cannot figure out how to guarantee or certify that GPT-4's advice would be safe or effective.
* **Yokosuka, Japan makes history as the first to employ AI-powered Chatbot in its municipal offices**  
\- Yokosuka becomes the first Japanese municipality to use OpenAI’s ChatGPT in municipal offices, as part of a one-month trial involving 4000 employees aimed at improving administrative tasks. With a declining population and limited employees, the city is hoping to use AI tools to free up human resources for tasks that require personal attention.  
\- The hope is to use ChatGPT to assist in tasks like summarization, marketing copy ideation, drafting administrative documents, and perfecting easy-to-understand language. The move comes as the Japanese government is exploring AI's potential use for government administrative tasks.  

* **The House of Representatives gets 40 ChatGPT Plus subscriptions to experiment with AI**  
\- Congressional offices have started experimenting with AI. The House of Representatives' digital service has obtained 40 Licenses for ChatGPT Plus, which were distributed earlier this month. The House recently created a new AI working group for staff to test and share AI tools in the congressional office environment.  
\- According to an internal AI Working Group email, the AI tool is expected to be used for various day-to-day tasks and key responsibilities. Some potential applications include generating drafts for constituent responses and press documents, summarizing text in speeches, drafting policy papers or even bills, and creating logos or graphical elements for branded office resources.
* **OpenAI releases Shap·E, a generative AI tool that produces 3D Outputs in seconds!**  
\- OpenAI has released a new project called Shap·E, a conditional generative model designed to generate 3D assets using implicit functions that can be rendered as textured meshes or neural radiance fields.  
\- Shap·E was trained using a large dataset of paired 3D assets and their corresponding textual descriptions. An encoder was used to map 3D assets into the parameters of an implicit function, and a conditional diffusion model was used to learn the conditional distribution of the implicit function parameters given the input data. It has demonstrated remarkable performance in producing high-quality outputs in just seconds.
* **ChatGPT Plus, with superpowers of web browsing & 70+ Plugins**  
**-** The latest release notes of ChatGPT highlight various updates and new features added to the model, such as the ability to turn off chat history, export data, and use AI plugins. In addition, there are updates on the model's performance, factuality, and mathematical capabilities.  
\- ChatGPT Plus subscribers get early access to experimental features, such as the ability to choose between different versions of ChatGPT and new experimental models that can browse the internet and use third-party services.
* **ChatGPT in your pocket: OpenAI brings ChatGPT to iPhone**  
\- OpenAI has released the ChatGPT app for iOS that allows users to have engaging and personalized conversations with an AI language model. It will sync your conversations, support voice input, and bring the latest model improvements to your fingertips. Also, ChatGPT Plus subscribers get exclusive access to GPT-4’s capabilities, early access to features, and faster response times, all on iOS.  
\- They have started the rollout in the US and are expected to enter additional countries in the coming weeks. OpenAI said: “Android users, you're next!”
* **OpenAI to grant $1,000,000 to democratize AI**  
\- OpenAI has announced a program to award ten $100,000 grants for experiments aimed at developing democratic processes to govern the rules and behaviors of AI systems.  
\- Recognizing the far-reaching impact of AI technologies on society, OpenAI encourages applicants to create innovative proof-of-concepts for a system that incorporates diverse perspectives and is shaped by public interest. The program is specifically designed to address questions about AI behavior, such as the conditions under which AI should criticize public figures or how it should represent disputed views.  
\- Applicants are encouraged to submit their proposals by June 24, 2023, and may choose from a list of policy questions or propose their own.
* **Open AI’s latest idea can help models do math with 78% accuracy**  
\- Even SoTA models today are prone to hallucinations, which can be particularly problematic in domains that require multi-step reasoning. To train more reliable models, OpenAI trained a model by rewarding each correct step of reasoning (“process supervision”) instead of simply rewarding the correct final answer (“outcome supervision”).  
\- It was found that process supervision significantly outperforms outcome supervision for training models to solve problems from challenging MATH datasets. The model in the experiment solved 78% of problems from a representative subset of the MATH test set.  
\- Additionally, process supervision also has an important alignment benefit: it directly trains the model to produce a chain-of-thought that is endorsed by humans.
* **OpenAI announces $1M Cybersecurity Grant Program to boost AI-powered security**  
\- OpenAI is launching the Cybersecurity Grant Program—a $1M initiative to boost and quantify AI-powered cybersecurity capabilities and to foster high-level AI and cybersecurity discourse. The goal is to work with defenders across the globe to change the power dynamics of cybersecurity through the application of AI and the coordination of like-minded individuals working for collective safety.   
\- OpenAI has also shared a few general project ideas while sharing the news. Moreover, it will prioritize projects intended to be licensed or distributed for maximal public benefit and sharing.
* **OpenAI’s massive update on GPT-3.5 & GPT-4 APIs**  
\- OpenAI announced exciting updates, including more steerable API models, function calling capabilities, longer context, and lower prices.   
\- Function calling is now available to enable LLMs to work more effectively and efficiently interact with your programs/tools.    
\- The latest GPT-3.5-Turbo model is available with support for 16K context (\~20 pages of text)
* **ChatGPT builds robots: New research**  
\- Microsoft Research presents an experimental study using OpenAI’s ChatGPT for robotics applications. It outlines a strategy that combines design principles for prompt engineering and the creation of a high-level function library that allows ChatGPT to adapt to different robotics tasks, simulators, and form factors.  
\- The study encompasses a range of tasks within the robotics domain, from basic logical, geometrical, and mathematical reasoning to complex domains such as aerial navigation, manipulation, and embodied agents.  
\- Microsoft also released PromptCraft, an open-source platform where anyone can share examples of good prompting schemes for robotics applications.
* **OpenAI’s Superalignment - The next big goal!**  
\- OpenAI has launched Superalignment, a project dedicated to addressing the challenge of aligning artificial superintelligence with human intent. Over the next four years, 20% of OpenAI's computing power will be allocated to this endeavor. The project aims to develop scientific and technical breakthroughs by creating an AI-assisted automated alignment researcher.   
\- This researcher will evaluate AI systems, automate searches for problematic behavior, and test alignment pipelines. Superalignment will comprise a team of leading machine learning researchers and engineers open to collaborating with talented individuals interested in solving the issue of aligning superintelligence.
* **OpenAI makes GPT-4 API and Code Interpreter available**  
\- GPT-4 API is now available to all paying OpenAI API customers. GPT-3.5 Turbo, DALL·E, and Whisper APIs are also now generally available, and OpenAI is announcing a deprecation plan for some of the older models, which will retire beginning of 2024.  
\- Moreover, OpenAI’s Code Interpreter will be available to all ChatGPT Plus users over the next week. It lets ChatGPT run code, optionally with access to files you've uploaded. You can also ask ChatGPT to analyze data, create charts, edit files, perform math, etc.
* **OpenAI enters partnership to make ChatGPT smarter**  
\- The Associated Press (AP) and OpenAI have agreed to collaborate and share select news content and technology. OpenAI will license part of AP's text archive, while AP will leverage OpenAI's technology and product expertise. The collaboration aims to explore the potential use cases of generative AI in news products and services.  
\- AP has been using AI technology for nearly a decade to automate tasks and improve journalism. Both organizations believe in the responsible creation and use of AI systems and will benefit from each other's expertise. AP continues to prioritize factual, nonpartisan journalism and the protection of intellectual property.
* **OpenAI doubles GPT-4 message cap to 50**  
\- OpenAI has doubled the number of messages ChatGPT Plus subscribers can send to GPT-4. Users can now send up to 50 messages in 3 hours, compared to the previous limit of 25 messages in 2 hours. And they are rolling out this update next week.
* **ChatGPT will now remember who you are & what you want**  
\- OpenAI is rolling out custom instructions to give you more control over how ChatGPT responds. It allows you to add preferences or requirements that you’d like ChatGPT to consider when generating its responses.  
\- ChatGPT will remember and consider the instructions every time it responds in the future, so you won’t have to repeat your preferences or information. Currently available in beta in the Plus plan, the feature will expand to all users in the coming weeks.
* **Worldcoin by OpenAI’s CEO will confirm your humanity**  
\- OpenAI’s Sam Altman has launched a new crypto project called Worldcoin. It consists of a privacy-preserving digital identity (World ID) and, where laws allow, a digital currency (WLD) received simply for being human.   
\- You will receive the World ID after visiting an Orb, a biometric verification device. The Orb devices verify human identity by scanning people's eyes, which Altman suggests is necessary due to the growing threat posed by AI.
* **OpenAI is rolling out new updates to improve ChatGPT**  
\- OpenAI is shipping out a bunch of small updates over the next week to improve the ChatGPT experience. Here’s a tl;dr  
1. Prompt examples: At the beginning of a new chat, you will now see examples to help you get started.  
2. Suggested replies: ChatGPT will suggest relevant ways to continue your conversation.   
3. GPT-4 by default: When starting a new chat as a Plus user, ChatGPT will remember your previously selected model – no more defaulting back to GPT-3.5.  
4. Upload multiple files: Now, ChatGPT can analyze data and generate insights across multiple files.  
5. Stay logged in: You’ll no longer be logged out every 2 weeks!  
6. Keyboard shortcuts: Work faster with shortcuts, like ⌘ (Ctrl) + Shift + ; to copy last code block. Try ⌘ (Ctrl) + / to see the complete list.
* **ChatGPT’s emotional awareness is more than humans'. What?**  
\- A study found that ChatGPT has higher emotional awareness than humans. The machine was subjected to a standardized test measuring human emotional awareness and scored significantly higher. The test required participants to show empathy in fictional scenarios.   
\- ChatGPT outperformed humans in all categories, achieving an overall score of 85 compared to 56 for men and 59 for women. The researchers suggest that ChatGPT could be helpful in psychotherapy, cognitive training, and diagnosing mental illness. Previous studies have shown that people perceive ChatGPT's responses as more empathetic than medical professionals.
* **OpenAI launches a web crawler to train ChatGPT**  
\- Called GPTBot, the crawler will comb through the internet to train and enhance AI's capabilities. It can be identified by the following user agent and string.  
\- Web pages crawled with the GPTBot user agent may potentially be used to improve future models and are filtered to remove sources that require paywall access, are known to gather personally identifiable information (PII), or have text that violates our policies.   
\- Moreover, OpenAI also revealed how websites can prevent GPTBot from accessing their sites, either partially or by opting out entirely.
* **GPT-4 to replace content moderators**  
\- OpenAI aims to use its GPT-4 to solve the challenge of content moderation at scale. Also, they already used GPT-4 to develop and refine their own content policies. It provides three major benefits: consistent judgments, faster policy development, and improved worker well-being. However, perfect content moderation remains elusive, as both humans and machines make mistakes, particularly in handling misleading or aggressive content.  
\- GPT-4 can interpret complex policy documentation and adapt instantly to updates, reducing the cycle from months to hours. This AI-assisted approach offers a positive future for digital platforms, where AI can help moderate online traffic and relieve the burden on human moderators.
* **GPT-4 Code Interpreter masters math with self-verification**  
\- OpenAI's GPT-4 Code Interpreter has shown remarkable performance on challenging math datasets. This is largely attributed to its step-by-step code generation and dynamic solution refinement based on code execution outcomes.  
\- Expanding on this understanding, new research has introduced the innovative explicit code-based self-verification (CSV) prompt, which leverages GPT4-Code’s advanced code generation mechanism. This prompt guides the model to verify the answer and then reevaluate its solution with code.  
\- The approach achieves an impressive accuracy of 84.32% on the MATH dataset, significantly outperforming the base GPT4-Code and previous state-of-the-art methods.
* **OpenAI enables fine-tuning for GPT-3.5 Turbo**  
\- OpenAI has launched fine-tuning for GPT-3.5 Turbo. Fine-tuning lets you train the model on your company's data and run it at scale. Early tests have shown a fine-tuned version of GPT-3.5 Turbo can match, or even outperform, base GPT-4-level capabilities on certain narrow tasks. Here are the fine-tuning steps:  
\- OpenAI also said that none of fine-tuning data, input or output, will be used to train models outside of the client company. And that fine-tuning support for GPT-4 will arrive sometime later this fall.
* **OpenAI launches ChatGPT Enterprise, the most powerful ChatGPT version yet**  
\- Open has launched ChatGPT Enterprise, the most powerful version of ChatGPT yet. It offers enterprise-grade security and privacy, features for large-scale deployments, unlimited higher-speed GPT-4 access, 32K context for faster processing of longer inputs, advanced data analysis capabilities, customization options, and much more. OpenAI is also working on more features and will launch them soon.
* **OpenAI's ChatGPT enters classrooms**  
\- OpenAI has released a guide for teachers using ChatGPT in their classroom. This guide includes suggested prompts, explanations about ChatGPT's functionality and limitations, as well as insights into AI detectors and bias.  
\- The company also highlights stories of educators successfully using ChatGPT to enhance student learning and provides prompts to help teachers get started. Additionally, their FAQ section offers further resources and answers to common questions about teaching with and about AI.

Multiple students are using ChatGPT to do some of their assignments. For example, our student blog posts for weekly seminar discussions are *obviously* AI-written. I've used multiple AI writing check websites that are all showing 75%+ of their writing is AI. I've cross-checked with my own and other students' posts who don't appear to be AI. All of our posts are showing up 80%+ human-generated on every site. 

Last year, I personally observed someone sitting next to me run discussion questions through ChatGPT during class. He also generated AND coded an interview right before class began. We were supposed to conduct a real interview, transcribe it, and code it. We had a month to complete the assignment, and he did it in five minutes. It was totally fabricated. 

Now, I get that it's not my responsibility to enforce any kind of ethics or plagiarism policies at the university. The professors can pursue it if they want to, and I certainly don't want to interject myself or get myself into any hot water by bringing it up. 

But here's the issue: We regularly have group assignments (in 9 courses, I can think of at least 7 group assignments at some point during the semester). I am now paired for the fourth time with people who are doing absolutely nothing for the group project.  Zilch. Last spring, I literally typed up a script for a partner to read during a presentation, and he got credit and praise from the professor for ""his"" portion of the assignment. Absolutely boiled my brain because I spent hours doing all of it.

So now I'm in a group, and two of my partners haven't done anything yet. I stayed up late last night making sure we had our first portion completed. 

I know I can report this to the professor. I've avoided it because I feel like it's not responsibility and it would look bad to make any accusations, especially if they prove to be unfounded. But it's getting frustrating because my coursework experience is negatively affected when I've been paired with others who either aren't doing anything or are skating by using AI programs. 

There are five members of my nine-member cohort that seem to be doing this. 

Suggestions? Grit and bear it? Report it to a professor?",User_deleted,1

16dzwol,1,2023-09-09,Messing around with LLama2 7b_q4 has been an eye opening experience.,u/Mescallan,LocalLLaMA,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/16dzwol/messing_around_with_llama2_7b_q4_has_been_an_eye/,"These are just some thoughts, I would love to hear other peoples opinions. 

I installed the 7B base model with the intention of fine tuning it for an NLP project I'm working on, but I decided to spend a bit of time to get some experience with how it processes things and what it's outputs are like and man is it a fever dream. 

I completely understand what people have been saying about base models being hard to use and not feeling human. It really gives me a whole new respect for the RLHF work that has been done. I have been role playing reality and chatting with it about it's existence, some deep philosophical issues have come up and it has been a great experience for me to work through these issues. I understand that it's just next word prediction, it's actually pretty obvious with this small model, but suspending my disbelief for a bit has been a very fun experience.

On the topic of censorship, I personally enjoy having an uncensored model, it's been very refreshing that it tries to answer everything with no limits, I can see how a more powerful model would be useful in bioterrorism or subversion, this little guy not so much lol. As a teacher though it's nice that I can go on chatGPT with young students and be confident that nothing inappropriate will happen if I just let them do whatever they want. Even if there was a check box in the settings, the students would find it and turn it off (I think there should be one don't get me wrong, but purely from a teaching perspective it's great that there isn't).

I still use an old version of Disco Diffusion, which is one of the earlier clip diffusion image generators, because it's outputs are restricted and I have to build around it's restrictions. I am quite enjoying the 7B model for that same reason. It feels like I am having a fever dream, it can be completely lucid at times, and at others go off the rails with nonsense, at the same settings.

16e4qaz,1,2023-09-09,Plagiarism on the first assignment,u/LibrarianNo4990,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/16e4qaz/plagiarism_on_the_first_assignment/,"I am teaching AP Micro teacher this year. I have been teaching Economics and Financial Literacy at my current school and am excited to teach an AP again (I taught AP Macro at my last school). I had my students do a pretty extensive summer assignment that involved reading the book Freakonomics and writing a critique on the book.  
  
I did this for a few reasons but one reason was to ensure students were up for the task of taking this course. Apparently students heard the class was easier than a lot of others based on the previous teacher and I wanted students to take me and the class seriously.  
  
Well now I have at least 6 students who either plagiarized (2 were clearly the same just reworded) or used ChatGPT to write the essay.  
  
Questions for you all:  
1. Is it fair to kick them out of the class for cheating on an essay when the class is basically a math class? Some students may have taken the class BECAUSE they suck at writing and a few of them this is their first AP and they are doing really well in the class so far. This for me is the biggest ethical dilemma I face in terms of my decision. Obviously they cheated, so a consequence is necessary - but should they be kicked out of the class?  
2. I don't have proof that one student used ChatGPT but it's obvious to me as someone who uses it fairly regularly to stay up to date with the latest tech trends and to understand how it works. What would you do here?  
3. Two of the essays were clearly a mix of AI and their own writing. Would you treat this differently?  
4. What do you think is the best way to approach the students? Obviously I would be kind about the situation as I hate being accusatory when I don't have a plethora of evidence in some instances. I also don't know their writing styles yet so this makes it harder.  
  
All of the situations are a bit different and I want to be fair in how I handle this. Its also only been 2 weeks since school began in my district and if these kids are willing to cheat on their first assignment maybe they don't take this seriously and I should cut them loose? Any advice is useful!  
  
I also think it's important to note that the book uses data analysis to explain why some teachers might choose to cheat on state exams...so the irony here is killing me 😅",User_deleted,3

16f9vl6,1,2023-09-10,Taking a women's class as a man and it is killing me,u/Galba__,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/16f9vl6/taking_a_womens_class_as_a_man_and_it_is_killing/,"I'm a college student in my final semester (ideally). My university made a scheduling mistake and didn't offer more than one capstone (sort of a final synthesis class related to your field of study)  related to my major (we are required to take 2). 

So, my choice was either stay another semester  to take only one class or take the only other class I had the prereqs for and would count. 

I chose to graduate. I would like to enter the workforce and move out of my college town as soon as possible. I'm tired of being a broke college student. So, I took a Women's leadership class. It was the only option. I am a man. And this class is tailored to women. So, the work is not engaging, it feels silly to do (writing about my negative experiences as a woman for our first assignment), and the workload is insane. 

It's just busy work. Massive writing assignments each week about subjects that literally don't even apply to me because I am a man and don't have the experiences we're supposed to write about. Vision boards about our personal goals (I'm a stem major), reading books about embracing our bodies and dealing with sexual harassment, and weekly round tables where we talk about how hard it is to be a woman. 

I'm all for embracing my feminine side but I literally just do not have the bandwidth to care, do not engage with the material at any level, and don't have the time. 

This is the easiest of my 6 classes and 2 labs and it takes up the largest portion of my time due to the sheer volume of work. On top of that, I am getting bad grades. I assume because I am a man. The class materials have been somewhat hostile towards men and have -at times- made me uncomfortable and the professor (not a PhD but contracted through a regional campus to teach this class) has been less than professional in our interactions. 

I got a C on an introductory video post where we were literally required to state our name, major, and 2 facts about ourselves. She gave me a C and left no comments as to why. I have so far received bad grades (C or worse) on every single assignment without feedback despite following instructions to the letter. I am a straight A student and was genuinely (albeit narcissisticly) hoping to graduate with a 4.0. 

The class is not available to take as pass/fail. It's stressing me out significantly. I have one month left to drop without penalty (I don't know if it will affect my scholarship and need to ask). Basically, what do I do?

Should I email her and ask for leniency? I feel like that will only make it worse. I don't even know how to do better on my assignments as I am doing everything asked of me and I'm getting no feedback on my grades and nothing but vague responses about formatting when I email and ask. 

I do not have the time to put in more effort and I'm already putting about 7ish hours a week towards this class. My other classes take up in total about 50 hours a week and I work part-time which takes up most of my free time but I can't cut back my hours because I have bills to pay and I need to eat.

I'm considering using ChatGPT to do most of the heavy lifting which scares me because I've never cheated before. But I've seen some of my friends in the class's assignments and grades and it looks like she only cares about quantity rather than quality. Although, some of them look identical to mine in length and substance and have received better grades. 

I just don't know what to do. I'm not getting a C in this class and ruining my GPA or worse failing it and not graduating. Please, give me advice I'm at a loss. 

TL;DR: taking a class meant only for women, struggling to engage and getting bad grades despite following instructions to the letter. Need the class to graduate and don't know what to do.",User_deleted,1

So my understanding is that Large Language Models like Chat GPT run off of probabilities that the next word in a sentence is the right one. Basically, it produces language that is highly likely to be produced. 

Therefore,

Can't the same model evaluate how likely a sentence is in real life, and flag the elements that don't reach a certain threshold? Maybe even suggest what words are more likely?

I get that LLMs can't evaluate meaning, which would be a big hurdle here. If the system were primed rather conservatively to favor false negatives over false positives, it could be a tool that allows world language teachers to grade more but not work any harder.",active,2

(If so, I'm sorry.)

In the article, Jordan Stein starts by raising the issue of using ChatGPT to cheat in composition classes.  Definitely something we're all thinking about.  But he then goes on to make the claim that students don't cheat just to get out of doing work or in an attempt to inflate their grades.  Nope.  They cheat because, well, life is hard and it's just what people do when life is hard. 🙄   What we as professors need to do is to make sure their lives are less hard.  Then they won't cheat. This is how we ""abolish cheating.""

How can we make their lives less hard? One suggestion he makes: ""Pink Time- An exercise that requires students to skip class in order to reflect on personal motivation in the context of greater autonomy.""  Other suggestions are collaborative learning and accessible design. Groundbreaking stuff.

I hope I'm not being too hyperbolic in saying that this kind of nonsense is killing higher education.  It trades on the idea that nothing a student does is the just result of their own decision making.  They are helpless cogs in an uncaring, evil system and our job is to protect them, to understand them, to insulate them from the consequences of their decisions.

16gtl3i,1,2023-09-12,"Figured out how to make Infographics w/ Midjourney + ChatGPT, WITHOUT fake-AI-text (+18,500 Infographics Templates for All industries)",u/papsamir,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/16gtl3i/figured_out_how_to_make_infographics_w_midjourney/,"**Disclaimer: No ads, you don't have to sign up, 100% free, I don't like selling things that cost me $0 to make, so it's free, even if you want to pay, you're not allowed! 🤡**

**(over 18,000 free infographics templates you can use at the bottom)**

Hi all, I'm back with doing too much for no reason. I've been trying to find a way to make infographics using Midjourney, and it's near-impossible to *not* get that non-sensical fake-AI text if you say ""Infographic""

For example, for the prompt: ***make an infographic with 5 empty boxes, green theme, environmentalist society, vectors in background --ar 2:1***

https://preview.redd.it/j4efhfywztnb1.png?width=1908&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b55716e7be95b4b1462cfa12b14801920a3e95f

Those boxes are 1. not empty, 2. filled with fake text. I've tried a few things to make this work.  


1. Use AI Text Remover apps, they hardly work yet, maybe in the future, but right now, they leave blotches of this fake text
2. Use an upscaler and try AI Text Remover apps on all the cropped segments, this is too unnecessarily expensive, and still isn't a good solution.

I even tried using so many different prompts, trying, BEGGING Chatgpt to write a prompt that Midjourney can understand, where I want **no** fake AI-text, but no luck.

&#x200B;

Then I had an idea, what if I just give it an plain image with boxes ? So I did, and then I stopped using terms like ""Infographic"", and ""No text"". Simply mentioned what you *do* want, as opposed to what you *don't* want.

This is an example of an image with plain boxes:[https://cdn.hero.page/grid-images/1-2-grid-shapes.png](https://cdn.hero.page/grid-images/1-2-grid-shapes.png)  


[2 x 1 Grid](https://preview.redd.it/wc5jnugy0unb1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f32165ffb556088b0fbaea71e870f673553c96f)

I used the prompt:

    https://cdn.hero.page/grid-images/1-2-grid-shapes.png 2 empty shapes. surrounded by (Manga Characters, Long Hair Bubbles, Action Scenes) and Manga and Anime related vectors in the background which is a gradient of the colors Pink, Purple, Green, Blue. Image is full height and full width with no cropping. Leave the shapes empty with nothing inside, flat material vector design, 2D, illustration, background has illustration --ar 2:1

and I upscaled this fricken masterpiece!

https://preview.redd.it/g1ltfu573unb1.png?width=1904&format=png&auto=webp&s=03283dc57f5ec8011b4646ebcdfd0971aaaf3018

This is the first time I've successfully generated a nice infographic ***template*** with no fake text, and I've been doing it like crazy.  


Here's is the template of the prompt for Midjourney:

    https://cdn.hero.page/grid-images/1-2-grid-shapes.png 2 empty shapes. Surrounded by ({{vectors}}) and {{keywords}} related vectors in the background which is a gradient of the colors {{colors}}. Image is full height and full width with no cropping. Leave the shapes empty with nothing inside, flat material vector design, 2D, illustration, background has illustration --ar 2:1

You can change this part ""flat material vector design, 2D, illustration""  to match the theme you want.  


You can also get a list of all the [empty grid images I made here](https://hero.page/samir/plain-grid-images-variety-of-shapes).

I uploaded a bunch of standard grids, asked ChatGPT to give me a list of industries and relevant factors. This is the prompt I use in ChatGPT for it to generate a Midjourney prompt for an infographic:

    The template variables in the given string are {{vectors}}, {{keywords}}, and {{colors}}.  I want to create an infographic for Gaming. Come up with a list of 4 vectors, 2 word related keywords for Gaming like ""Headphones, Gaming keyboard"", and 3 colors that will make a nice gradient. These colors should be in simple english, like ""Dark red, blue"" etc. Not Hex colors.  
    
    Then, input those values into this template string, and return the full string in plain text: 
    ``` https://cdn.hero.page/grid-images/1-2-grid-shapes.png 2 empty shapes. Surrounded by ({{vectors}}) and {{keywords}} related vectors in the background which is a gradient of the colors {{colors}}. Image is full height and full width with no cropping. Leave the shapes empty with nothing inside, flat material vector design, 2D, illustration, background has illustration --ar 2:1 
    ```

Feel free to update these to match your case. You can make your own simple grid images too for different sized infographics, but I have use the following Aspect Ratio sizes (standard in design industry):  


* 1:1: Square
* 4:3: Standard Screen
* 3:4: Vertical, Standard
* 2:3: Vertical, Alternative
* 5:4: Golden Ratio, Close Approximation
* 6:1: Long Horizontal Banner
* 1:2: Vertical, Half Length
* 2:1: Horizontal, Half Height
* 5:3: Custom Widescreen

The reason I made so many is so I have an unlimited collection of BASIC infographics templates, because now, instead of using empty boxes, I can use SAMPLE infographics to generate even better ones. This one below is generated with the image i generated above!  


https://preview.redd.it/pfbodpwy6unb1.png?width=1888&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6022b662738e69cde3dd3a047bc95cdcb75b43d

Of course, you'll get better results with simple, plain grid images.  


Here are all the infographic templates I made. All free & personal use. I guess they're commercial use too, as in you can hopefully promote your products using them, but please, people always try to package these free resources and sell them on Gumroad, etc., **please don't**. I know this won't stop you, but just think about it 😭❣️

&#x200B;

Here they all are, categorized (somewhat) **they all have the Hex color codes found in the images, too:**

16h803n,1,2023-09-12,Please Chance Me for Top-Notch Universities! (But I guess any input is fine... lol whatever),u/goldenshine88,chanceme,https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/comments/16h803n/please_chance_me_for_topnotch_universities_but_i/,"Hey, everyone! I've been lurking on this subreddit for a while, and I finally mustered up the courage to create my own ""chance me"" post. Now, before we dive into the nitty-gritty, I must warn you that I'm aiming for the crème de la crème of universities, so please take that into consideration. But hey, I guess any input is welcome... or not, lol. Here's a little background on me:  
\*\*Demographics:\*\*  
I come from an upper-middle-class family that values education, and I attend a highly regarded private high school where academic excellence is the norm. I am unhooked, but I think I make up for it. Lol.  
\*\*Academics:\*\*  
\- GPA: 4.0 unweighted, 4.8 weighted (our school offers the most rigorous courses, naturally).  
\- SAT: 1570 (760 English, 810 Math) - retaking it to push my score to perfection, because settling for anything less would be, well, unacceptable.  
\- AP Courses: Completed 12 AP courses by the end of high school, scoring 5 on all of them. But seriously, who doesn't, right?  
\*\*Extracurriculars:\*\*  
\- President of the prestigious Debate Club (naturally, only the best).  
\- Founder of the local chapter of a renowned non-profit organization that combats poverty (just another day of saving the world, right?).  
\- Interned at a prestigious law firm during the summer (because we all need a taste of the elite life).  
\- Award-winning pianist and concertmaster in my school orchestra (a little artistic talent never hurts, does it?).  
\*\*Awards and Achievements:\*\*  
\- Won numerous regional and national debate championships (but hey, who's counting?).  
\- Recipient of the coveted National Merit Scholarship (just a little recognition for my brilliance).  
\- Earned the gold medal in a prestigious international piano competition (because playing piano is a mere pastime for geniuses like me).  
\*\*Essays and Recommendations:\*\*  
My essays are truly a work of art, capturing my unique life experiences and profound philosophical insights. My English teacher, who happens to be a published author, will undoubtedly craft a recommendation letter that transcends mere mortal praise. I mean, who else would capture the essence of my brilliance better?  
\*\*Intended Major:\*\*  
I'm still undecided, but I'm torn between astrophysics and molecular biology. You know, just a couple of simple fields for a person of my caliber to dabble in.  
\*\*Dream Universities:\*\*  
I'm eyeing Ivy League schools like Harvard, Princeton, and Yale (because what else would an exceptional student like me settle for?). But hey, I guess any input on other top-tier institutions is welcome... or not, I suppose. Lol.  
So, esteemed chance me wizards, please grace me with your verdict. Do I stand a chance of getting into these heavenly institutions? I eagerly await your humble opinions, even though I may secretly scoff at them. Lol, whatever!

I asked ChatGPT to write an r/chanceme post and this is it  😭😭

There is one who has taken this course three times and is still not prepared and seems to be even worse this semester, so I am glad they are stopping out before they flunk out again.)

I can see them making the connections and responding to each other, and I know I am seeing genuine learning, not ChatGPT crap.  I will be retiring at the end of the semester, so I have hope that I will go out on a high note.",active,30

16holu0,1,2023-09-13,problems with my literature teacher,u/Jazzlike_Status9637,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/16holu0/problems_with_my_literature_teacher/,"I don't really know where to begin. This is my first year with this literature teacher (combined humans) and though he is pleasant to have, and tries to make his lessons engaging, a lot of us in his class have found ourselves a bit lost when it comes to actually answering essay questions for our exams. Let's call him Mr X. Many of us agree that he's a good teacher, and could probably help a student who is failing achieve a C5, he is not the kind to really push students to score their distinctions. 

For starters, though he gives homework, he rarely marks and allows students who have not submitted any work at all to walk scott free. I have also encountered students who use ChatGPT and similar AI language models to write their PEEL paragraphs simply because they lack an in depth understanding of the text. We are doing the book Kindred by Octavia Butler and though it is hailed as a groundbreaking novel illustrating several themes such as trauma and American myopia in regards to slavery, our teacher has failed to say more than a few words on this topic. Instead of helping us delve into analysis, Mr M merely skims through the book and highlights some key points we may want to quote during exams. I also recall messaging him on how I could further develop my answer, and what he sent me was just copy pasted from ChatGPT (he left in the part where it said ""Certainly! Here are some points on the portrayal of theme of violence in Kindred by Octavia Butler""). Though ChatGPT is useful in many ways, I wanted his opinion as a marker to see how I could score more points since referring to the rubric he gave wasn't enough for me. 

Lessontime is where his greatest flaws show. Our Literature class is known for being rather laid back, but it has gone to the point where Mr M can barely control the class' noise level. Mr M is a mild mannered man who rarely raises his voice to scold. As a matter of fact, he rarely scolds students at all. This has turned our literature classroom into a bit of a zoo where students who actually want to learn and pay attention are a minority. Each one of his lessons forces him to pause when the noise level gets to high, and then pause once after 5 seconds when it returns to that level.

My worst experience with him has to be when I and three other students participated in a competition. At the beginning, he gave us a guide on what to do during the competition and how past teams have won. When he checked on the progress done by our group a week before the competition, he realised two of our group members had not contributed anything to our discussions and thus we did not have a sufficient number of points. Instead of getting them to at least read through what the other team mate and I had written down, he participated in gossip with them, effectively wasting the whole session that could have helped us prepare more. (We did well for the competition though, I carried.) 

I feel like he is the kind of teacher who wants to be viewed as a friend of students and not someone to be feared. While this does take away some pressure during class, our class has taken this for granted and have taken advantage of his kindness. He's definitely noticed that he is too nice to us, but he lacks the courage to do anything about it.

To teachers, for the benefit of students who want to learn and improve, please do not hesitate to shout at the class to get them to shut up when they're too noisy and disruptive. In some cases, it's totally necessary. You can still be known as the nice cher if you reprimand the class once or twice. It is necessary to maintain discipline of the class in order to allow lessons to be smooth-sailing. You should also know the content of what you are teaching well, even if it is a new syllabus (our school previously used a different book for literature and only changed to Kindred this year)

16hybcf,1,2023-09-13,I emailed 100 college professors for business advice!,u/Zwigs_,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/16hybcf/i_emailed_100_college_professors_for_business/,"Hola,

I'm a 24 years old, and I quit my 9-5 job to chase ""the dream"". I have studied a fair bit of business-y related things but sometimes I get confused! Also google & chatGPT are nice tools BUT it's nice to talk to a real professional human who can understand the nuances and details of your situation. So I use this technique to get some free advice.

**Step 1:** Google ""Colleges with \[whatever subject you need help on\] programs"" 

For me most recently it was ""Colleges with business law programs"" 

**Step 2:** Find the faculty page

most colleges have a public email for all their professors 

**Step 3:** Pick a professor & email them!

You can read descriptions of the classes they teach and their background.

here's the [email template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14zkJUS32JQOu4x7ALTRXTWli7aM9-CRvYO4lZsQyMbA/edit?usp=sharing) I used, but do whatever works for you... nothing too complicated!  

What I ask for is a fifteen-minute zoom call to ask all the questions I have.

**Step 4:** Repeat 100 times (or however many you feel like)

**Results:** 

Roughly 60% didn't answer, 15% said no, 20% said they weren't the right person, and the last 5% agreed and followed through with a fifteen-minute zoom call. The calls were very helpful, and pointed me in the right direction! Additionally, a few provided me with additional contacts of people who can help me further in a variety of areas! 

If you need/want more meetings there's three options:

1: email more people 

2: email the 35% of people who said no or weren't the right person for the contact info of someone who could help me. It's called the **door-in-the-face** technique. A person who refuses a larger request is much more likely to agree to a smaller request.

3: email the people who didn't respond!

Lastly, I think that professors are eager to help people because higher education has turned into a race to pass classes and get a degree rather than actual learning (I'm quite guilty of this). Professors' office hours are often vacant until a student fears failing or gets stuck on an assignment, and my theory is that they are happy to help someone who isn't just in search of a good grade and shows passion for the subject.

I was really excited that Mojo became publicly available and thinking which project can I implement to learn Mojo concepts. Since I have already ported llama2.c to [pure Python](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/15qcbel/p_llama2py/), I decided why not try to port llama2.py to Mojo now.. And here is what I got

First round of llama2.c vs llama2.🔥 battle. Mojo demonstrated 20% better performance than C in a single threaded execution of llama2 inference and 250x times better performance than Python

https://i.redd.it/0gcwwfc2r7ob1.gif

For reference Mojo is using SIMD vectorization, that's why it's performing great for matmul operations. In the other hand, it turned out that gcc also aggressively optimizes all for loops it can find, so I suggest this benchmark is pretty fair. 

&#x200B;

[Mojo natively supports SIMD vectorizations out of the box](https://preview.redd.it/pzuh3ktet7ob1.png?width=1546&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bd5e1f969520c5741b3256fac894a87c702a6eb)

&#x200B;

After that I decided to compare both solutions in multi-threaded (parallelized) mode, and now \`llama2.c\` strike back with help of OMP that helped perform 20% better than Mojo

Basically you type in your issue and it returns search terms that can be used in lexis or west law. It definitely seems like its going to save me time but I don’t want to get in trouble. I’m sure I’m over thinking this but here are the ”default AI rules” for my school. Again, the extension just gives you search terms; basically it translates your issue (that you write in plain English) into 'legal jargon' terms that you can take to lexis or westlaw to get started finding relevant cases. What do you guys think? I do plan to eventually submit the assignment for credit. 

>**In the absence of explicit directions to the contrary from instructors, the following default rules apply at the University.**

>I. Work submitted for evaluation is represented as the student’s own intellectual product. Students may not submit content (e.g., ideas, text, code, images) for evaluation that was generated, in whole or in part, by Generative Artificial Intelligence tools (such as ChatGPT and other large language models). Doing so without instructor’s explicit permission constitutes cheating under the Code of Academic Integrity and is therefore prohibited. 

> Examples (illustrative only) of conduct that is prohibited unless explicitly permitted by the instructor: 
	
>* A student types a prompt into a GAI tool and pastes all or part of the generated content into their answer on an out-of-class assessment or test. 
	
>* A student types a prompt into a GAI tool and incorporates all or part of the generated content into an essay submitted for evaluation, without proper attribution to the GAI tool. 

>II. Students are permitted to use GAI tools to generate content that is not submitted to an instructor for evaluation. For example, using GAI tools to study for examinations, tests, and quizzes is permitted. Likewise, on assignments where the use of the Internet is not otherwise prohibited by the instructor, GAI tools may be used for learning, studying, and brainstorming.

16jt4gb,1,2023-09-15,I feel so frustrated about my life.,u/Noirjk,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/16jt4gb/i_feel_so_frustrated_about_my_life/,"I'm a university student.

When I was in highschool I wanted to be an astrophysicist but people kept telling me not to do it because they kill scientists in my country. I didn't care, I still wanted it and checked how to become one. There wasn't any college or university that taught it so I had to apply for foreign countries after majoring physics and then I saw the price. I simply couldn't imagine affording that in any way. I didn't grow up rich. Me and my parent were in debt. My country's economy is collapsing. So even after getting enough score for physics major in the city I wanted, I decided not to go for it. 

I applied talent exams/auditions of art schools with no practice and got in the one that was again, in the city I wanted. The art majors in my country are insanely outdated, I can find ten times the information they teach every semester in one week. I said, it's alright, I'm here for a degree(college/university degree is still important for ""respect"") and I can focus on making money digitally. Then I focused on digital art a lot. 

Since I wasn't serious about art back then, I never thought of getting good fast. I didn't study art, I never took a course. My fundamentals were non-existent compared to my classmates. Naturally I decided to work hard on my art these last two years. I wanted to tell stories, I wasn't interested in finding a company job. But then one thing struck me and I lost my will.

First of all, Paypal and all of its alternatives are banned in my country. Second of all, my country's money is losing value each day. If I work here as a career, it will barely pay my bills, maybe even not. I don't want to live my entire life like that. I want to try while I can.

So I have better fundamentals but it's still not good enough for a project, I assumed, before deciding on something else.

AI happened. With AI easily stealing artwork, replicating art styles, being much better than me.. I got discouraged. Can I become good enough before someone can use AI to rip off all my hard work? I'm still not at a professional level. It will take me at least a year, maybe two, maybe ten. 

At the same time, because of my family situation I needed to earn money. I have expectations on me. I'm an only child with a single parent. According to my relatives and family member, ""I'm too intelligent to fail in life. I have too many skills, If I am determined I can earn a lot in any field I want."" I don't know why they think that. I might be intelligent enough to learn fast, but I have no experience in life, no communication skills, I'm so depressed, I have the lowest self esteem possible, I always act like someone else. I do try to be more outgoing but no matter what I do I'm either extremely irritated by people's really religious old fashion ideas or they are irritated because I failed to understand their social cues.

Anyways, at the end with AI and my skill developing rate, I decided to learn game development instead. I could keep improving my art alongside. I already had fiction ideas and scripts that I've been noting for years, I'm decent enough at art, If I learn coding and the engine I can do it. 

My family member/parent realized that I decided to change my path and they truly believe that I can ""make a good game to publish on Steam"" within six months with zero experience. Since they're helping me with college, and renting has became too expensive even for a part time job. I tried to explain them that almost nobody can learn a new game engine and programming well enough to produce a polished game with good art and good fiction in six months on their own. There might be people that have done that, I don't know, I certainly don't think that I can do that. But they insist on me doing this, that I'm not everyone or there will be consequences. Their reason in my head is valid, they want me to stop waiting for the right time, I know that if the deadline came they wouldn't punish me even if they say so, still I wanted to take this as an opportunity for myself to stop being so depressed and passive in my life. (I honestly act so passive, opposite to my actual personality.) I didn't have the best childhood but I understand their reasons and we have mutual love for each other. I'm a young adult now, I'm not a teenager anymore.

So I've been learning Unity and C# the past month. My plan was to follow tutorials first to get familiar, then learn the logic of C# scripts, make five to ten browser game level really basic games and then start on a real, still small project while learning. Well, today I read about the Unity news. I listened to people's opinions on YouTube while painting a girl to ease myself and got really frustrated because the girl never looked Asian enough. She always looked like a white girl in hanfu clothing. Every time I paint at first I see my improvement and feel happy, but then I find another shortcoming. I closed the program, paused the Unity doom news and started typing this post. I feel so defeated in every way. I will probably switch to Godot or Unreal while I'm still a beginner, but I'm scared that I wasted this month. 

Also, I talked to a classmate today. He said that he's using ChatGPT and AI art to make videos. He doesn't know English, he's trusting the generated text. He's planning to make hundreds of videos since it's so easy. This reminded me of something. My whole life I kept thinking ""If I just stop having my principles and do what everyone else does, I could have earned a lot of money, I could have made lots of friends."" I could use my language skills to translate for companies, people here claim to know English but most of them can't really speak it, I could have made AI art for quick money when I first heard of it a long time ago, I could find graphic designing gigs like my classmates do, I could teach children with rich families back in my town, I could create an OnlyFans account, I could try to be just a fraud like how many high income people I see are. Just take people's money, just use them, deceive them. Just ignore the clear bullying and ridiculing people do to each other and become friends with them. Just act like you're having fun. Stop being a killjoy, let them talk behind others' backs. Stop being so serious and honest all the time. But I'm just too proud to do it. I'm too selfish to my principles that I simply reject learning how to be in good terms with different kinds of people. What they do shouldn't bother me, I shouldn't be so sensitive to rude behavior. But I am. I'm to arrogant and mostly, I still have the luxury to choose while in university.

I don't even want to be rich, I just want to live a life without money as a worry. Also I really want to earn enough money for Cryonics before I die.. (This truly became my only hope for living. Even if it fails or is a deception, it's a better chance than hopelessly decaying for me.)

Yet with how nihilistic I am, seeing how the economy is going in my country, the world, I struggle a lot to keep going. Sometimes I truly want to disappear. Then I feel scared because I want to have a girlfriend before I die. (I'm born female.) I feel lonely too, scared, I feel like I'm born defective because I simply can't seem to be decent. I also feel so much remorse for my mistakes in my teenage years that it makes me feel like I don't deserve to be happy.

16jusnp,1,2023-09-15,Received My TOEFL Scores! 30R 30L 30S 29W,u/notwho-u-thinkIam,ToeflAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/ToeflAdvice/comments/16jusnp/received_my_toefl_scores_30r_30l_30s_29w/,"Hey! So, I took the test on the 9th and got the result on the 15th. Since I don't really get much free time these days, I thought of giving the prep for 3 weeks on and off, although I think this could easily be scaled to a week or two if you have the time. I'll be mentioning my prep, quite extensively - sorry for the extremely long post but those kinds of posts always helped me so I'm just paying it back  
**Context**  
Just some context in case people want to know about my prep: I'm from India, and I think I come in the above-average bracket when it comes to English proficiency. Also, I had already taken the GRE, so I did not struggle as much with vocab. If vocab is your problem, I think some time to Magoosh's flashcards or Barron's 800 Words can help. In general, I used the TST Prep Toefl yt channel for strategies and for questions. I also had an application that had around ten old toefl papers, so that helped too.  
**Prep & Strats**  
***Reading*****:**   
Prep here was just practice-based. I used the description of the questions as tst prep gives them to know exactly what the questions ask of me. Also, I never read the passage from the start (I heard some people did that). Found it much more efficient to read the paragraphs as I go through the questions.  
***Listening*****:**   
Also practice-based. But I think the more important thing is to make notes. My notes were generally along the lines of I write whatever I hear as fast as I can. If you have better note-taking techniques, please use them.  
***Speaking*****:**   
This and writing were the sections I was most worried about. Mainly because I did not buy any official material that could help evaluate my prep. Even then, I think I was able to gain some insights based on my score and my methods.  
\- You have to be really loud in this section. The mics at my centre weren't good, and you needed to scream for it to pick your voice up properly. Add in the fact that there are 20 other kids in the same room as you, screaming at the same time as you. Also, speaking loudly at the test will definitely slow your speed of talking, so please take that into account during your prep  
\- Don't fake an accent. This tip is especially for international students. I heard some people in my room trying very hard to sound American. It did not help. It slowed them down so much they couldn't complete their answers. I don't think it'll give you much of an advantage.  
\- Each question is to be spoken differently. Q1 is more of a casual conversation question. So even though you should definitely limit the use of slang, this Q is more like talking to a friend. Q2 should be spoken like a reporter where you're only giving cold, hard facts and none of your own emotions. Q3 & Q4 should be done as if you're a teacher explaining a concept to a 5-year-old kid. I hope these make sense. This was the best way I could describe them.  
***Writing*****:**   
\- Writing For Academic Discussion: Just go to the website, and you will find that ETS has graciously given us sample questions, and when you answer them, the AI actually gives you a score. So use that to your advantage for however long it's there. When it comes to strategy, I think the best scores come when you provide an answer worth 120-150 words (even though ets recommends 100). Also, your answer does have to be different than the answers mentioned as examples. And it is not necessary at all to refer to the answers mentioned above. Don't really know what else I can say about this.  
\- Integrated Writing: Again note-making is crucial. The structure will simply be intro, reason1, reason2, reason3, conclusion. In each of the body paragraphs, I suggest using one line to refer to the passage and two lines to refer to the lecturer. Making more points from the para is not given high marks as the para is visible to you while you're writing the answer. For those of you who are thinking about how to evaluate your responses for free - Well I just used chatgpt. I prompted it to act like an ETS writing scorer and gave it the rubrics to score on. I then gave it the passage, the transcript, and my answer and asked it to score and give feedback.

The thing is I am not quite sure what are the things I should go about learning. From the things I've research a bit I generally got an advice and that is to **just make games**. I understand that as I believe that we can learn things by doing it.

The thing that I always keep questioning is what is after that? I want to do something related to both art and programming and there's this thing called technical art where both skills come to play. I've grown fond of making art 2D and 3D for a year now and I've been learning it too. I got my skills of programming from college and building small websites (frontend). I also made small games like snake, tic-tac-toe, pong with SDL and Unity. Now, what I think is that the technical art may be the one for me.

So, I'd appreciate any kind of help a lot. Please provide me an insight to this field. Where I live, there's not many people to reach out to discuss this stuff too so I really need this.

Today I had some free time and asked ChatGPT to come up with things to focus on and provide with a kind of curriculum and I made a spreadsheet of that thing :p Please take a look at  [the spreadsheet too](https://i.imgur.com/rIzVslD.png) and provide me your advice. Thank you :)",active,23

16l406w,1,2023-09-17,"Yes, teaching your students creative ways to memorize math formulas is useful",u/D_Empire412,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/16l406w/yes_teaching_your_students_creative_ways_to/,"**While I am a student, I believe this idea has merit and teachers should know about it.**

Around a month ago, I posted on various subs (including this one) about the usefulness of songs as a study/memorization tool for math and [linked a song I made (with the help of ChatGPT) to help study for a quiz on trig identities in Precalc last year](https://share.cleanshot.com/CYcmDxr7). Yesterday, I realized the true usefulness of a song or memorization tool. In AP Calc AB (for us it is still only the 5th day of school so we're reviewing Precalc topics), we had a quiz on trig, which I thought I knew very well as it was my strongest topic in Precalc last year (I think at least partly because that is when I began the strategy of making songs to memorize formulas), and I did many practice problems. However, yesterday, one of the things we were tested on was sin/cos/tan (2x) given sin/cos/tan (x), something I never learned in Precalc class last year and only briefly practiced over the summer on Delta Math, and I was completely stumped and got both of those two questions wrong, making my score 82. Immediately after class, I decided to Google the formula and found out how easy it truly was and now highly regret not making a song or finding some other way to memorize it. It really works, at least for me. This is why:

&#x200B;

* When composing such a song (even with the help of ChatGPT), you have to give it all the information and keep iterating on it until it can accurately convey all the information. The song I have linked above took 17 iterations and prompt refinements on ChatGPT to create a draft of the lyrics, which I then had to add and fix certain things that were incorrect. Being able to drill down on the material in such a way helps you really understand the essence of it.
* I had to sing the song multiple times to make sure I had a version good enough to share. While it may seem annoying, I felt singing it multiple times helped me further memorize the key points and formulas. Plus, music enhances memory.
* When making the visuals, I had to go back in and listen to each line or few lines, and create relevant visuals, and in terms of the example problems, show my work, showing that I can ""illustrate"" what I'm saying, a key part of this as often the brain best remembers visual and auditory queues together.
* Listening again helped further engrain the material.
* It's fun! While making the song, I was having a lot more fun than just reading over my notes, while studying just as hard, if not harder, but not even realizing it. If you want to understand a hard topic, the best way is to get interested in it, and what better than learning it in a fun way?
* This shows I can teach the material to someone else. A friend of mine who saw the video above thought it reminded him of a song for third graders. While he kind of meant it as a bad remark, I took it the other way, because this shows I'm presenting ""hard-to-understand"" material in an ""easy-to-understand"" format, simplifying it into material even students not great at math could likely understand.

  
Because of this, I have a strong regard for songs and other fun, untraditional memorization/understanding tools as a genuine study method for high school-level math classes. It has had proven results. On 4/5 of the Precalc topics I did this with, I got an A on their respective quizzes. Meanwhile, on my first quiz in AP Calc this year, about a central trig topic I didn't learn in Precalc last year, when I didn't try to use a song or untraditional memorization/understanding tool, I only got a B-. When it comes to many problems, as long as you could memorize important formulas and know how to ""plug and play"", you could likely do well on any quiz/test.",User_deleted,4
16lbqix,1,2023-09-17,Anyone suspect that a parent is doing the student's homework?,u/burner_duh,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/16lbqix/anyone_suspect_that_a_parent_is_doing_the/,"I teach at a SLAC. Part of our brand is that we are a nurturing institution. So, in addition to the average college student population, we tend to attract a small but significant number of students who need extra support. I take true satisfaction in working with students who might otherwise fall through the cracks or not be able to get a degree because of their need for accommodations. 

However, there are regularly one or two students in my classes who appear to be incapable of producing college-level work on their own. For instance, one student is seemingly unable to write in complete sentences on in-class worksheets or exams. When required to do work in person, the student turns in a small mess of sentence fragments. Likewise, when the student emails me, the messages are strangely worded, incomplete sentences in all lowercase letters without punctuation. Somehow, this same student submits well-written, flowing, detailed responses when submitting homework online. I don't think that the student is using ChatGPT or other AI services to produce these answers, because they require citation to texts we are using in class. Rather, I suspect that the student's parent is inappropriately involved in their homework, either by doing the homework entirely or ""editing"" the student's work to the point of effectively redoing it. 

Ultimately, I realize I am not the ""work police"" and it's to the student's detriment if they are not doing their own work. Still, it bothers me. Have you dealt with a similar situation? How did you process it?

16li7os,1,2023-09-17,Comprehensive guide to get Internship and new grad job,u/Specific-Winner8193,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/16li7os/comprehensive_guide_to_get_internship_and_new/,"**Before I start writing this, some opening word:** 

English is not my first language, so pardon me for that, I will format the wording with chatGPT

I am international student, so I understand the concern on F1 OPT, H1B, etc... All advice here is applicable for international student, Citizenship will have a better time.

This guide is aiming to help people that just graduated navigate their job to high paying company or student to look for internship. Here is the resources you should expected in this guide. **I fully believe that a regular person can get into FAANG ( except quant, they are monster ).**  If I see any of these questions repeat in csMajor, probably a sign for me to quit this subreddit completely. Also if I get butthurt enough from the comment, I will remove this post.

\- Interview guide, Resource guide, Networking guide, International student guides, Leetcode guide, Finding interview guide, Road map the hard way in 2 years college

\- Finding help with the above point ( I will not answer question that can be Google, like acronym )

**Motivation on writing this post:** 

I have seen numerous post on CsMajor, CsCareerQuestions, etc... Many times I have not found a single actual guide on getting jobs for early new grad and students. Its also very trigger me to see post shaming company falsely, with other redditor support. Understand that it stems from lack of confident and frustration, hence the guide.

**Background (my story):**

**Currently, I am working in my second job at FAANG with 2.5 YOE. This is my journey**

I am an **international student**. **English is not my mother tounge.** Coming to US in 2017 for college, I study at a **top 100 Liberal Art College.** Initially, I was majoring in Biology, which only when I reach last year of my Sophomore did I change my major to Computer Science. I did not know the concept of internship until December of my Junior year and how it would affect job after major**.** I graduated at 2021 and my internship was rescind by COVID. **So no name college, late starter, no prior background of CS and no internship.**

**Prep: I took unpaid internship for 9 months, begging professor for an unpaid research position in summer.** I work in cafeteria and using research position to ask for a grant to survive ( I was required by my parents to have scholarship to cover partially US university fees ). In Senior year, with some experience in research and unpaid intern, **I managed to land a job with ICC, CCC and WITCH ( which might involve shady practice )**. I then leverage the experience after few months and land a interview/job with multiple FAANG, Big bank company and tech company. Currently, Im leveraging FAANG salary in options market for an even bigger goal.

**THE GUIDE:** 

this guide is built from ground up, which mean as long as you put in the work, you can make it. It is formulated for all of my friends and some of my junior in college. it would require at least 2 years to prepare. 

Freshman: I will update this later

**Sophomore/Junior: Your goal is to find internship. If not, your goal is to turn anything into relevant work experience.**

**New grad ( without internship ): Your goal will be getting your first job, no matter salary, this will transition to high paying job**

**New grad ( with internship ):  Your goal will be getting interview with high paying company. As you often will secure a return offer.**

&#x200B;

**THE PREP ( the hard working way )**

**Getting a job posting/ interview:** 

1. **Networking/socialize:** 

* If you are living in big cities, go to places where TECH people is gathering, it might depend on where you live, such as badminton, board game, discord, reddit, etc... TONS OF PEOPLE RELOCATE TO NEW JOB AND LOOKING FOR FRIENDS
* If you are living in small cities, talk to alumni, take a bus to big cities once a month (or bi-weekly) and do the above. 
* Approach them like how you would make friends in college, we don't bite. 

1. **Job posting site: Here is some query for you guys**

**Preparing for interview:**

**Behavioral, YOU HAVE 20 MINUTES FOR THIS SECTION:** 

*  **ALWAYS ANSWER WITH ITS DEPEND:** A trully experienced engineer will never jump into conclusion. For every behavioral question such as: name a time you face difficulty, leadership, communication etc... Come up with atleast 5 different stories, here are a template applies for new grad, internship and etc...: All of these is just a chance for you to show off and will never deviate from each other. ALSO USE STAR Method
   * Level 1: General situation, use on first round interview/ less experience interview. For plot hole, just answer its how our culture work and I was planning to fix it
      * Hook: During my work on \[Intern/class/Personal project \] 
      * **Situation ( THIS IS WHAT IMPORTANT )**:  a bug happens \[Before presentation/ submission/ public PR review\], and I need to push out code without my teammate knowing. I have to decide between customer/teachers and teammate but its was outside work hour/study hour
      * **Action ( THIS IS WHAT IMPORTANT )**: Create a feature flag, documenting change and let teammate know why I did it, if they dont like, by turning off feature flag, it revert to old state
      * Result: Team was happy with my changes and project is positive, teacher is happy, award for thoughtfulness. 
      * Result2: Team was unhappy with my changes but for valid reason, I bring this thought up to my teacher/ manager as suggestion and it includes in my review/grade
   * Level 2: Complex Situation a, use for manager, more experience candidate
      * Hook: During my work on \[Intern/class/Personal project \] 
      * Situation: When working on \[pipeline/database/Legacy code/ML Algo/Security hole/AWS KBS/ Azure CRM/ GCP Function etc.... \] - 1 layer deeper of technology. I notice in our code, we have to decide between performance, memory and reliability. If I choose performance or memory, reliability take a hit. **I discuss this with my SENIOR / TEAMMATE/ TEACHER.**
      * Action: **in the end, performance in the SHORT-TERM** then move on to fix **RELIABILITY. The point is to priotize customer/teacher/result FIRST AND FOREMOST. You also show case your DEEPER KNOWLEDGE AND CALMLY ANALYZE THE Situation**
   * **Prepare atleast 5 level 2 story, add these element to some: deadline, collaboration, unexpected situation, GOING ABOVE AND BEYOND WITH DOCUMENTATION DOCUMENTATION ( ESPECIALLY DOCUMENTATION )**
   * THROW ALOT OF JARGON ( OUTLINE IN TECHNOLOGY SECTION BELOW )
   * Level 3: you dont need level 3 :)

**Leetcode:** 2 leetcode a day, in 1 years, thats 700 questions, and 3 years that 2100 questions. Dont skip or slack this. Your goal is to solve medium in 20 minutes, brute force in 5 minutes. need no more than 2 times to run the code ( AS IN PRODUCTION, YOU HAVE PIPELINE AND YOU CAN ONLY TEST IN LOCAL )

Interview Mock: DO IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN. [Interviewing.IO](https://Interviewing.IO), Leetcode, PRAMP ( if you like someone, add friend online AND PRACTICE  )

**LEETCODE TEMPLATE: PRACTICE SPEAKING SLOWLY, IN THESE ORDER, YOU HAVE 25 - 30 MINUTES FOR THIS SECTION, MINUTE - BY - MINUTE Instruction ( THIS WOULD MAKE SENSE IF YOU DO 2 LEETCODE A DAY, ALL THE NEW GRAD/INTERNSHIP LEETCODE IS EASY/MEDIUM ) - theres only so many questions they can ask:** 

**- \[ 0 - 2 \]: READ MUMBLING ENOUGH FOR INTERVIEWER TO HEAR, ALSO GIVE YOU TIME TO THINK**

\- \[ 2 -  5 \]: ""ok so I get the gist of the problem, can I assume overflow/negative number/special character/ etc.... "" . Only PROCESS IF INTERVIEWER GIVE SIGNAL ( NODDING, response, etc.... ). "" Thanks for suggestion, I will go ahead under assumption that etc... "" You should got answer from practicing already

\- \[ 5 - 9 minutes \]: **Explain your brute force**, if interview ask to code, CODE. "" What do you think ? "" THEY WILL ASK ABOUT MEMORY/EFFICIENT O(n), then pop out and said I think its run in (On\^2). But it can be improved to O(1). 

\[ 9 - 15 minutes\] : DO NOT CODE YET. **Write PSEUDO CODE, AFTER INTERVIEWER CONFIRM CORRECT, YOU START CODING, FOLLOW THIS STRUCTURE: \[Init\_methodname\],\[execute\_methodname\],\[test\_methodname\]. REFACTOR THE CODE LIKE YOUR LIFE DEPEND ON IT. REMEMBER TO WRITE TEST ALSO. THIS SHOULD BE SYNTAX FREE AND CLEAR IT FAST.**

\[15 - 30 minutes\]: **INTERVIEW WILL BE IMPRESSED BECAUSE YOU WRITE TEST AND REFACTOR. ALSO THE TIME FOR 2nd question, just repeat what you just did above, IF THERE IS A REALLY HARD QUESTION, YOU DONT NEED TO CODE, JUST PSEUDO CODE IS ENOUGH FOR STRONG HIRE**

This with Behavioral should be 45 minutes, 5 minutes to ask questions. ASK THEM STORY LIKE WHAT AN INTERESTING THING YOU WORK ON/DIFFICULT THINGS - use this answer to IMPROVE YOUR BEHAVIORAL STORY

REPEAT THIS INTERVIEW 4 times for big TECH and 2 times for BIG BANK

&#x200B;

**SYSTEM DESIGN TEMPLATE:** VERY RARE, incase of bank company asking their new grad

\- GROKKING THE SYSTEM DESIGN INTERVIEW ( thats all you need, basically this roadmap )

requirement -> API/method design -> Database choice NOSQL/ SQL -> Reliablity/SMSQueue/Hosting server/DATABASE SHARDING ( or equivalent, cant remember the right term )/ HASHING/DOCUMENTATION/LANGUAGE CHOICE -> Everything else is almost auxilliary for new grad

**DATABASE, SQL INTERVIEW:** IN VERY RARE CASE ( LIKE YOU VMWARE ), they gonna ask about SQL QUERY, i do not have experience in this, so you should pray

&#x200B;

**Technological expectation:**

Internship: Know how to do leetcode, team work, project collaboration, BE CONFIDENT

New grad: Know a bit system design ( just concept like database, caching, security, cloud depend on your field of interest - **YES, IF YOU JOIN ICC, CCC THEN YOU WILL LEARN ALL OF THESE** ), devops, frontend, backend, has team work story, BE EXTRA CONFIDENT

  
**TECHNOLOGY STACK** to impress in behavioral:

Internship: 

**LANGUAGE OF CHOICE, BASIC CLOUD QUESTION** ( AWS, AZURE - literally anything you can look in 5 minutes - advanced version is CODE TO INFRA, which JUST TO LET YOU GUYS NOT COMPLAIN ITS TOO HARD TO LEARN ), **WEB FRAMEWORK** ( pick 1 ): .NET, Spring, Express, etc... **TEST FRAMEWORK: JUNIT, DOCKER ( ADVANCE VERSION IS KUBERNETE, FIREWALL, IP, ORCHESTRATION ), TRELLO**

New grad:

Same as internship + CICD PIPELINE ( JENKINS ), POSTMAN, JIRA, COMPARISON BETWEEN 2 DIFFERENCE LANGUAGE ( Easiest is Python vs Java, I hate Python )

&#x200B;

**If you feel like you have tried everything and it still didnt work, please post these, I will take argument without 3 out of 4 of these claim as troll post:**

\- Anonymous resume

\- Leetcode stat

\- Social Network attempt ( why ? Because your resume doesnt match where you are living, thus you might be trolling )

\- Unpaid Internship/Research/Independent project/ Github link

\- Company applies to ( screenshot please ) (if I see you only apply to CA, Seattle, CO, NYC, or big companies, thats your problem when you are new to the career )

&#x200B;

Feedback are welcome, if something is unclear, please understand english is not my first language. Also don't assume my internet persona is the same as my IRL persona

Also im a bit high when writing this, so sorry

ALSO SORRY IF I ACCIDENTALLY POST THIS WITHOUT CHATGPT FORMAT

I will do a placement year doing compsci related work on my 3rd year. The problem is, my CV is quite empty right now (have no previous work experience) and companies will be receiving applications throghout October. I have some experience in most things (web design, game dev, ML, data science etc.) but don't have any finished projects that I can present. Some personal projects I have worked on are a chess engine, a 2d godot game, and a lot of small AI stuff with LLMs and NeRFs. I am a very very quick learner and worker and I believe I can use google and chatgpt quite well to get up to speed on any topic. I am planning to make a bunch of small projects in the following month. I need some personal project suggestions that look cool and show skills but not too time exhausting to actually implement. Also any suggestions on how to fill up my CV in a limited amount of time are also welcome.

I assigned a paper (worth a pretty good percentage of their grade) and noticed that this one student turned it in late, which was out of character for him. As I started reading the paper, I noticed that it was very unlike his previous work and seemed AI-generated. I was curious, so I typed the paper prompt into ChatGPT and basically got his submission word for word- my suspicions were confirmed. However, I held off on grading it and requested that he come meet with me. I wanted to see what the reason behind him doing that was. He admitted that yes, he did use ChatGPT, because he procrastinated and was overwhelmed/in a rush to submit it. If it was some emergency or situation out of his control, maybe I would be more understanding, but procrastination…really? Just manage your time better. So, I decided to give a 0 on the assignment. He asked if he could do a rewrite, but I don’t allow those as stated in my syllabus. I could have reported him to the dean, but I didn’t.

16nhf4k,1,2023-09-20,How ChatGPT will change education,u/Super_Towel,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/16nhf4k/how_chatgpt_will_change_education/,"Hello everyone!  
Recently I found some good sources of information about how ChatGPT will be involved in people’s education and how it will be used in the future (a very discussed topic between my peers) and thought I will share it with you all.  
There is no brainer that with this technology which is evolving rapidly the potential ways are unlimited, but the most exciting part is that it will have a huge significant impact on education. Here are a few:  
**Foreign language learning**  
Written text between different languages could be translated using ChatGPT. Although English is favored, ChatGPT can also grasp other languages, and as time goes on, this capability will increase. Thus, it might be used by students to instantly translate information written in a foreign language into their mother tongue.  
Other language learning applications ChatGPT could be used for include:  
\- explaining grammar;  
\- reviewing and correcting written assignments;  
\- providing vocabulary exercises;  
\- providing instruction on how to pronounce words;  
\- re-writing existing articles in Simple English (or other languages);  
\- generating custom dialogues and stories based on a student’s instructions, which could be helpful in understanding the nuts and bolts of the target language.  


It also can help with real time translation during language lessons this way allowing students to make conversations with native speakers of that language.   


**Tailored feedback**  
The capacity of ChatGPT to precisely assess learners' output and deliver focused feedback is another crucial feature.  
AI is already bridging educational gaps that would otherwise be difficult to identify and remedy.   
For example, online course providers such as Coursera use AI to identify commonly occurring errors in students' homework assignments. In addition to informing the course instructor of their students' difficulties with the topic, it gives the latter with customized recommendations and instant feedback. Students obtain a correct knowledge of the subject without having to wait for the teacher's contribution in this manner.   
This means that technologies like ChatGPT will be able to get a sense of individual students' strengths and limitations. Furthermore, it can now precisely and effectively describe these concerns so that students understand how to proceed.  


And these are just a few reasons. I actually found this in a [guidebook](https://www.turingcollege.com/playbooks/chatgpt-in-education) created by Turing College. Also [Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/04/06/1071059/chatgpt-change-not-destroy-education-openai/) and [AIMultiple](https://research.aimultiple.com/chatgpt-education/) have very informative articles about this as well. These sources explain other ways as well as discuss the potential problems that could be caused by ChatGPT that I found to be quite interesting.  


Additionally, I would really appreciate your opinions about this and if you were able to use it to your advantage? Maybe you already use it in your daily life?",active,0
16o2te2,1,2023-09-20,I want to build a non-profit education super app,u/imman2005,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/16o2te2/i_want_to_build_a_nonprofit_education_super_app/,"\--- This [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ideas/comments/16g85qt/education_superapphub/) provides more context around the idea. ----

I don't know if this is protocol, but I want to create an education superapp. Let's call it Edusphere for now. It would be a student's hub for their educational and career journey. If you want to join the project, DM me for more information. NOTE: This project will most likely start in late winter or early spring, due to college applications.  


I asked ChatGPT to provide a more articulated manner for describing the app's functionality. I thought it would be hard to describe the complexity myself. I think it gave more of an elevator pitch, but please look into it. Down below ⬇️

\~\~\~

Introducing ""Edusphere,"" a groundbreaking education superapp poised to revolutionize the educational landscape. This comprehensive platform is designed to cater to students, educators, colleges, and employers, offering a one-stop solution for all things education-related.

16o4hrj,1,2023-09-20,What are your thoughts about AI in the academy?,u/ExcellentHamster2020,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/16o4hrj/what_are_your_thoughts_about_ai_in_the_academy/,"I've wound up on the AI committee at my university. I don't really know why; I have zero expertise or even knowledge in that area. The only thing I have to offer to the conversation is my skepticism.

For one, my colleagues have described how they use AI for tasks like completing really mundane things like nursing reports. I have yet to hear a convincing use for AI (among faculty) aside from using it to automate tasks or maybe speed up research. One or two are also teaching their students to use AI responsibly for similar tasks.

None of that seems like a good idea to me. I'm not interested in trusting a computer to do what I know I can do properly. ""Productivity,"" like summarizing a bunch of articles without engaging with the more nuanced elements of those articles, seems like the opposite of productivity - by which I mean, you're not really learning anything if you're not using an actual brain to do it. 

Second, if faculty are afraid their students are going to use AI to write papers and thus cheat, we've discussed teaching faculty ways to spot such cheating. We've discussed showing students how to use AI responsibly and properly. To me, it just seems like the next stage of the old [123essays.com](https://123essays.com) and the tricks that were around when I was in college. 

I'd rather see us have conversations with faculty about how to teach writing correctly so that students aren't able to use these methods: emphasize the thinking process over just creating a product; work on assignments in class together instead of just listening to lectures for the entire class period (ie, ""flipped classrooms,"" which aren't popular because heaven forbid anyone learn how to teach more effectively or do things a little bit differently). 

Ultimately, none of this AI stuff seems like something I need to get involved with, and I suspect a lot of faculty feel the same way. My one and only concern is that if students are essentially having someone else (ChatGPT or whatever) do the work, then they're not learning anything and they're just wasting their college education. 

So I'm asking this group, an anonymous bunch of professor-types, for your thoughts and ideas on this topic. I'd like to learn why anyone really cares about this matter, what you or your institution are doing about it, and so forth. Thanks. ",active,32
16o58zh,1,2023-09-20,How I self studied AP World History (and got a good ol' 5),u/skiiiirrt,APStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/APStudents/comments/16o58zh/how_i_self_studied_ap_world_history_and_got_a/,"Hey! My name is Leo. I'm a (now) grade 11 student in Toronto, Canada, and took the APWH exam in May when I was in grade 10. I didn't have an all encompassing guide to tell me what NEEDS to be studied, what COLUD be studied, and how to do do so. Consider this a masterclass, of sorts, and let it be my wisdom departing from one generation of painstaking LEQ takers to another.

Here's some background: I love history. I always have. This is why I chose to take APWH. Backstory done, lets get to the cool part now.

**THE FUNDAMENTALS**

First and foremost, you need to understand why you are taking this course. If your reason is ""I like history"", you'll be fine. Anything other than that, I recommend you do the following: Remove the HI in history. History, at its most basic, is a really long, complex and fascinating story that spans thousands of years, millions of events, billions of people, and trillions of pages in the Barron's APWH book. As soon as you look at history as a story, one that gives your actors personalities and the acts hundreds of years, it will not only fit in your head much better, but also help when studying for the exam.

Oh also, the CED is your BIBLE for the next few while. 

*BOOKS*

Next, you need to prep for the exam. Here's where things start getting particularly interesting. Your first big decision is to choose your review book. There are 2 main options, I studied both in the order Barrons, Princeton and here are my opinions:

Barrons is dense as HELL!! It is not readable, and the ""I like history"" schpeel I went on earlier is disregarded completely in this book. I like to think of it as a dictionary, You can't learn a new language with ONLY their dictionary, but it definitely helps when you have no idea what something means. Use this with caution, and do not trust it as your only book.

Princeton is written much nicer. It makes things much more of a story, and definitely helps with the comprehension aspect of things. It's also much nicer to use at 2 in the morning (sorry mom) and it makes you say ""OHHHH"" much more than Barron's. My rec if you prefer readability over pure and analytic data, but to each their own.

 \\Now, finally, we can start talking about the actual studying. I knew that since I was self studying, I had to study much more than the regular student and started about 3 months before the exam. I think that was the perfect timeline, as I only had about 4 days (8-12 May) where i was studying like a madman. The rest of the time i was comparatively calm about it, and took it progressively. Here's how splitting my time worked, and ways it didnt.

**MONTH 1**

Welcome to the battlefield, soldier! the next 4 weeks will be divided into doing one of 3 tasks possible. 

1. Pre 1450. I cannot stress this as much as possible; DO NOT MEMORIZE DATES AND PEOPLE. THIS IS JUST TO GIVE A BACKGROUND!!(This should only take you about a week; make sure to study the following super duper important historical developments :\[these are changes, events, thoughts, political ideologies, etc that lasted over a period of time and influenced the area a bunch\]
   1. Mesopotamia + early civilizations. They grew plants, they made food, they did a whole lot of stuff. This wont be on the quiz, but it helps to understand how the technological background on the exam content actually came to be
   2. A nice quick Asia rundown. Look at Chinese dynasties, the rise of polytheism in Asia, and the type of culture that emerged. It'll help a lot in the first units
2. Set up the materials. Get your textbook, subscribe to these channels (Heimler's history and all of his goons, khan academy), and get your history pants on because shits about to get SPICY
3. HISTORY WOOO!!! Open the textbook and read it LIKE A BOOK. LIKE A STORY. NO HIGHLIGHTERS, NO PRETTY GEL PENS, JUST YOUR EYES. The idea here is that you skim through it just so you understand what you're dealing with, and so that you can gauge the amount and difficulty of the material you are going to be looking at.

&#x200B;

**MONTH 2**

&#x200B;

By this point, you can start actually studying the material. Here's what a sample week in the ""Leo timeline"" would look like (change this to fit your needs) \[Oh also I divide each unit into 3 sections, things that happened {countries founded, people died, king started war}, developments that happened {trading increased, christianity moved to another continent, printing press led to more literacy rates} and foreshadowing {higher literacy rates because of more printing press WILL lead to an uprise against the church (i know this because i read the book about a month ago)}\]

Mon - Unit 1, developments; unit 1, things

Tue - Unit 1, developments; unit 2 foreshadowing; unit 1 content; unit 2 things

etc.

As you can see, the idea is to make a cascading calendar. Study more than one thing at once, as that will force your brain to tie them together and will lead to less time spent organizing developments.

Keep this going until you get to the end of all the content. Don't worry if you aren't versed in it too well, that'll improve soon.

Keep up with Khan Academy, watch Heimler's after a study session to recap what you learned, and make it fun! Let your future self stress about what grade you'll get, your priority right now is LEARNING!!

&#x200B;

**MONTH THE THIRD**

Here's where things will start to get interesting.... Now, your focus is honing in on the content skills from last month and learning how to take the exam. Your time should be spilt 50/50, where about half of your time is content REVIEW, and the other half is APPLICATION. In the review, keep doing what you were doing, just always getting deeper. OpenStax has a really good World History textbook if you want to be absolutely certain on the content side of things. The Application is tougher, but I found some cool workarounds that worked well for me:

1. ChatGPT. Use it to make questions, train it on the rubric given by the College Board, then make it grade your essays.
2. Remember how i said the CED is your Bible? Here's where that comes in. You should be able to flip (Or, more realistically, scroll) to any page on the CED and talk to yourself for a minimum of 20 minutes about what is written there. If not, more content review. If you can, do the following.
3. Write a MINIMUM of 10 LEQs and 10 DBQs. It seems like a lot, but you need to be able to pump one out in an hour. 20 hours of essay writing is more than enough. Make sure to write by hand to mimic the experience, time yourself, don't let yourself get up or use the book, and make the topics about things you know little about. No use quizzing a frenchman on the french revolution if he's writing an exam on Maori history, is there?

&#x200B;

**THE DAYS APPROACHING THE EXAM** 

Nerves will kick in. So will coffee. LOTS of coffee. So much, in fact, I quit and have not touched a cup since may 13th (1 day after the exam). But I digress.

&#x200B;

Your goal now is to take quizzes, review like hell, and what I believe was the best thing I did for my grade, write.

No, my young padawan, not writing LEQs or DBQs, you did that a while ago. Now, you write a full review of everything that happened of importance IN YOUR OWN WORDS!! Write this in Word. Or a doc. Write it on your arm for all I care. The important this is that you write in a way that makes stupid you from 3 months ago read it and understand what you mean. Because the secret is this. As soon as you step foot in that exam room, you will be the stupid you from 3 months ago. This document will guide you into understanding what you mean with the added bonus of helping exam-day you know the content.

Here's an excerpt from my document:

*""OK SO lets pretend that you're a leader in 13th century China (Song Dynasty, the water clock guys) and a bunch of people in your kingdom start to hate you. You now have to figure out a way to do 2 things. CENTRALIZE and LEGITIMIZE your power (""The power is mine, and this is WHY its mine."") There are some ways you can do this. The 3 most important and also the only ones i can remember at 10:53pm are as follows:*

*Art - If I'm a leader and have STUPID amounts of money I can make people build big, pretty, and useless things for me. Buildings and art are really good examples of this. For example, the Taj Mahal built in the Mughal empire like 200 years after what we're talking about was a way for the emperor to show whos the boss (I have a big castle thing and you dont, L + Ratio.)* 

*Religion - Caliphs, the guys who led Caliphates, considered themselves to be the spiritual and religious descendants of Muhammad, a main Muslim prophet. They consolidated + legitimized their power by basically saying ""Im descendent of Muhammad, you're not, So let me lead you and go farm or whatever."" This tried and true method was used ALL over Afro-Eurasia*

*Im better than you super alpha male mentality - In Song China, if you were to approach the Emperor, you would have to bow down, no shoes, trot, surrounded by 750 eunuchs and talk to emperor guy. This was a way of the emperor showing you whose boss, and making sure that EVERYONE knew whose boss. This meant the power was now his, would always be his, and he could do what he wants with your money.""*

As you can tell my writing style has greatly evolved. 

The point is that you understand not only whats on the test, but also how to write the test.

&#x200B;

**EXAM DAY**

You made it this far, and nothing can stop you now. You know what you need to, and you sit in that chair, stick a sticker and scribble some boxes, and before you know it you're mayor of 5 town (not president of 5landia though, thats reserved for Steve Heimler)

&#x200B;

I hope this ""guide"" helps the new and flourishing students of APWH 2023-2024, and if you have any questions, want tips, have a question about the content, or are just lonely, please reach out. 

Thanks for reading,

Leo

How does this bode for the future?,u/XochitlLatham,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/16pcbvi/a_university_disabled_turnitins_ai_detector_how/,"I just came across this [news](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/brightspace/2023/08/16/guidance-on-ai-detection-and-why-were-disabling-turnitins-ai-detector/) about Turnitin's AI detector, and I thought I'd break it down here for everyone. So, this AI tool was supposed to tell how much of a paper was written by AI but it turned out it had many issues of its own. A brief summary:

* **False Alarms:** At first, they said it had only a 1% chance of messing up, but now they're admitting it's more like 4%. So if this tool was around last year, so many student papers would've been wrongly flagged as having AI-written parts. 
* **AI Bias:** It's not very good at telling if a piece of writing is AI-generated or not. Sometimes, it mistakes non-native English speakers' work for AI-written stuff. 
* **Mystery Detection:** Turnitin hasn't been very transparent about how it figures out if something's AI or not. They say it looks for patterns in AI writing, but they won't say what those patterns are. Kind of sketchy.

So, Vanderbilt University decided to turn off this AI detector for now. I’d rather not go into the exams issue, but for a more valid application, I think using AI for research papers is cool as long as one makes sure that they cite the work properly, as that ensures transparency as long as the sources are not made up. ChatGPT does not offer the option to cite sources yet, but I know people using tools like [Silatus](https://research.silatus.com/) and [Trinka](https://www.trinka.ai/) for research and citing. Also, I’m of the opinion AI is here to stay and should be included as a core part of education, with teachers talking to students about AI usage guidelines and fair usage.

16q62k4,1,2023-09-23,$100 monthly budget on marketing. Redditors advise.,u/Official-DATS,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/16q62k4/100_monthly_budget_on_marketing_redditors_advise/,"I’ve recently posted the question on what to do if you have only $100 monthly on marketing and received so many responses and tips. The original post is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/16f4u2z/i_have_100_monthly_on_marketing_what_should_i/). I learned a lot from your comments and started to read and watch free educational content on marketing. That’s where I learned about general marketing strategies and some ways of applying them.

I feel that I should return the favor to the community and add some more value.

So, at first, for myself I carefully read, analyzed, and organized all the pieces of advice into sections. Here are they with some links to the most valuable and educational comments. And my personal comments on some of the advice I got.

* **Spend the $100/month on getting marketing skills and knowledge** (workshops, books, video courses, networking functions, YouTube videos, learning how to write sales scripts for your cold outreach calls and meetings, etc.) before you spend a dime on marketing. I'd say that it's the most reasonable advice ever!
* **Spend the $100/month on paid ads.** Below is a list of particular tips. That [advice](https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/16f4u2z/comment/k007bhi/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) has provoked the most heated argument, and I couldn’t figure out if it is working or not. Guess you won’t know unless you try! What are your thoughts, btw?

1. Use at least one month's $100 to outsource the building of a decent landing page to use in your ads.
2. Google Ads. All $100. Set a daily budget of $3.50. Set the time of day limits to 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. Set the location limits to the USA (in your case, it could be your location). Set the demographics to people involved in the industry your tool or product is for. Set the age limit to 22 or higher. Use ChatGPT for generating keywords. Keywords must be that people doing a search would use to find a solution to the problem your product solves. You could sometimes add competitors’ names to the keywords. You need to have at least 2 distinct versions of advertising copy. Bid the lowest amount Google allows.
3. Do not use “display ads”. Do not use software comparison websites like Capterra. If your budget has grown, don’t spend it all on Google Ads, as it may lead to the case described [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/16f4u2z/comment/k04ocn3/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) I feel sorry, man, that it went like that for your business.
4. Also, you could try one month of Google Ads evenly split between different campaigns. Try campaigns on FB/IG, TW, Lin, Reddit, and other channels in the coming months. Then go back to the best one and improve.

* Start improving organic search results through SEO (search engine optimization). It’s calculated that rates are higher among people who click on organic search results vs. search ads. But here is a trick: you need to be good at creating content yourself. Below are some additional or specific key points.

1. Create and start running social pages on FB/IG/Twitter/Reddit.
2. Make educational TikToks.
3. Create a LinkedIn profile for yourself, and the company. Start writing articles or posts.
4. Create a value-added mailing list or blog.
5. Make posts that describe your business on [Ebay](https://www.ebay.com/), [Kijiji](https://www.kijiji.ca/) and other marketplaces.
6. Create content that's more specific to your product, for high-intent searches (like someone searching for your product category specifically) and educational content for low-intent searches (like someone searching for a problem that could be solved with your product).
7. Get an Adobe subscription and start looking at YouTube tutorials to make advertising assets for yourself for social media and print. You get access to all their digital design tools, their video tools, their print design tools, and even a small amount of stock images. Make flyers. Make stickers. Make social media posts with some style to them. (This point I couldn’t divide into two parts because it's also about direct marketing).
8. Make fun videos, giving away $5 to every person who can answer your question correctly.
9. Start using [Virtual Window Shop](https://virtualwindowshop.com/). That’s the app that shows what's available near the user. It’s not so good for my product, but will be a great tool for others.
10. Start guerilla marketing and play where your competitors aren't. For example, do Reddit astroturfing.
11. Take JSON+LD schema / structured data. Get your search results more enriched by describing the content better for machines to understand. That’s the idea for those who are good at programming.

* Start to use AI tools. Such tools could help you solve almost all tasks in marketing: analytics, creating, posting, optimizing, checking, verifying, and so on and so forth. Most of the tools could be found on  sites like [Futurepedia](https://www.futurepedia.io/). Yet there were mentions of tools like [Jasper](https://www.jasper.ai/) (for creating engaging texts), and [MarketOwl](https://www.marketowl.ai/) (this one creates targeted content and posts it).
* Start doing direct marketing that includes:

1. Send personal messages, call owners, get an [Apollo](https://www.apollo.io/) sub, and send emails.
2. Buy gas and pound the pavement. It means that you go and introduce yourself to as many people in your ideal customer profile as possible. But you must be good at speaking, articulating,  and knowing your project as well as your competitors perfectly, or your potential customers won’t even speak with you.
3. Buy a printer, paper, laminator, and a good stapler and start to make business cards and flyers.
4. Hire a student for $30/day (2hrs of walking) once a week to drop off flyers in targeted segments.
5. Put yard signs where they can be noticed.
6. Rent an ad space on a bench, or whatever it could be, in front of the place where your target audience is.
7. If you already have customers, then you could ask your current customers where they heard about you and advertise there more. (Another piece of advice that could also work for organic search.)

* Do drugs, particularly peyote, lol. That’s the idea I couldn’t agree with, as I’m nerdy and have never done drugs in my life.
* Find business organizations that are in your area, and you might be able to join. Also check out [SCORE](https://www.score.org/) (the largest network of volunteer, expert business mentors who help start your small business) through the [SBA](https://www.sba.gov/) (Small Business Administration).
* Buy table dances and enjoy watching titties. I like the advice a lot, but I guess it will be much better to watch them after you succeed!

I hope it will help guys like me to deal with marketing issues better.",active,29

* **Comparison with Industrial Revolution**: Drawing parallels with the Industrial Revolution, Hyams observes that the pace of AI's evolution could disrupt industries even faster than past technological shifts.

**Which jobs are at stake?**

* **Tech and business at the forefront**: According to research from Indeed, roles in software development, technology, and business operations face the highest threat from generative AI.

Hey everyone, 

I hope this post finds you well. I find myself at a crossroads in life and could really use some guidance from this supportive community. **A bit about my situation:** 

\- I started my education in an international university when my family was financially comfortable. However, circumstances changed, and I've had to work tirelessly to finance my education and living expenses. hence paycheck to paycheck

\- Public uni and duales studium bachelor is not an option and I'm currently on a gap year to save up and apply to a public university in Germany. But here's the catch - they require proof of financial stability and good future prospects to support oneself. 

\- I've been taking on menial and mini-jobs to make ends meet, but it's becoming increasingly challenging to balance these responsibilities while managing the high cost of my English-language university. also my status currently not being a student, that is hard to find jobs and apply to one.

\- i read somewhere that someone can reapply to ausbildung and other access of studies/work during these times

\- learning German is difficult but i am still studying everyday and taking my time to do it

\-  the expectations and i am not allowed to return back home by family seems to be the most complicated problem for me. i am expected to reach my dream and chase what i should around because i am studying abroad, but it seems like there is no way without money and other important skills needed besides financial. 

**my questions would be:**

 how would it be best for me to proceed? i will be homeless (looked over wohnungloshilfe already, and no friends wanted to keep me around and stay for a bit at their place), i tried checking upon for arbeitlosgeld but i don't think i am even supported in this matter. i am only helped by the bank dispokredit as for now, financially. 

So, I'm reaching out to this community for any insights, tips, or suggestions you may have. Your experiences and advice mean the world to me. Please share your thoughts, and thank you in advance for your support.",active,0

I switched to Information Systems, but I had to retake some business core classes (accounting mainly) because, again, I wasn’t a good student and couldn’t force myself to work on courses I had zero interest in. 

Eventually I got screwed because I ended up with 150+ attempted credits (which includes retakes, F’s, and withdrawn courses) and couldn’t go back to school another year without racking up massive debt to complete my degree, so the only way I could leave with a degree before that happened was to declare Spanish as my major (it was previously my minor)  and Business as my minor, and finish those requirements within a semester. I graduated right when the pandemic hit so it took over a year to find work. 

I worked as a functional business analyst for a year, learned a good amount of SQL and relational databases but otherwise hated that job. I only liked the database portions. 

I managed to get a really, really, *really* entry level software developer job but it was basically a body shop and I quit 8 months in because the workplace was **HORRIBLE** with 50-80 hour weeks + weekends and my mental health was on a steep decline. I learned a bit of database development and really surface-level .Net programming. 

Now I’m just doing some easy low-paying data annotation job that I’ve partially automated with python and selenium (which I could only do with the help of Stack Overflow and ChatGPT) and going back to school at a local community college to finish math prerequisites — namely Cal 1, Cal 2, and Linear Algebra — in hopes of getting into one of those online MSCS or MCIT masters programs that don’t require having a STEM Bachelor’s degree. 

I’m just at a point where I don’t even know what I should be doing… 
* Is it even worth it to get a Master’s
* I can’t qualify for a single entry-level tech job in today’s market
* I really shot myself in the foot educationally.
* Are there even any internships/apprenticeships that require little-to-no experience? 
* Any companies that train new hires from the ground up? 
* My resume is abysmal and I have very little IT/Software Dev experience despite my work history.

Now in college, I scored a **CGPA of 4.78/5.00** and a **Dean’s List placing (Top 5%)** at a Top 5 University in Asia.

How?! 

By identifying and practising effective study tips that suited my behaviour and needs. But “effective study tips” is a huge bucket with a million micro-skills and habits. Below, I’ll distil this 1 huge bucket into my top 10 study habits that worked most effectively for me, and how you can apply these into your own study routine.  
**1. Use Multiple Learning Resources**: Use tools including textbooks, videos, and even podcasts to facilitate your learning.

Using different learning resources help you reinforce your understanding by internalising the material from different angles. It also helps make learning more enjoyable. For example, if I watched a video outlining real-life examples of Economics, I could better appreciate how Economic theory applies in the real world, and better retain the information.

Some resources you can use include:  
\* Text Resources - Lecture notes, Textbooks  
\* Video Resources - YouTube, Lecture videos  
\* Audio Resources - Podcasts  
…or make your own observations and examples in real life!  
**2. Study in Groups, but Stay Focused**: 

Leverage more brains to boost your retention output.  
One approach to maximise your retention (your productivity output as a student) would be to leverage on more focused brains as input. I’d watched a MrBeast video sharing how a small group working on learning/mastering YouTube video creation will surely outperform an individual on the same journey. This applies to studying too.  
One caveat here is that your study group should be hyper focused - everyone should be studying the same material/chapter with little to no distractions over an extended time period. A group of students gathered together but studying different material could potentially lead to distractions. Someone could ask a question unrelated to what you’re studying, and thus disrupt your flow state.  
**3. Ask Smart Questions**: Ask questions that cannot be directly found on Google or ChatGPT. Studying smart means using class time to clarify any questions about the material. To maximise study effectiveness, these questions should be focused, specific to the lecture material, and should not be directly found on Google or ChatGPT. 

For example, a smart question could be “For question 1, why did the professor suggest finding A then B, instead of taking the shortcut option C?”

To truly maximise studying efficiency, the first step to seek help would be to Google (or ChatGPT) possible answers to your questions first, instead of emailing the professor or waiting for the lecture day/time to arrive before asking the question. Seeking immediate help on your own cuts down time spent waiting for a reply. Your brain will also be focused on the task at hand, thus helping you retain the knowledge better when you do get the answer.  
**4. Eliminate Distractions:** Remove activities that take you further from your goal.  
To maximise study effectiveness, you must remove distractions. They are activities that take you further from your goal. Beyond usual culprits like spending too long on social media, distractions can include:  
\* Spending too much time planning your schedule instead of executing  
\* Studying with the wrong group of friends  
\* Having too many irrelevant browser tabs open  
To eliminate distractions, some tips I’ve found helpful include:  
\* Being in the right (conducive) environment - This is huge for me.  
\* Use focus apps like Forest to help you reduce screen time and gamify your study sessions.  
\* Working in shorter bursts and taking breaks in between.  
**5. Take care of your health**: Be mindful of your diet, sleep, exercise and mental health.  
Your effectiveness and productivity is correlated with your energy. Your energy is influenced by other factors beyond study hacks, including your diet, sleep, exercise and mental health. To maximise your effectiveness and productivity, ensure you get enough of each.  
**6. Understand yourself**: Know what works for you, and what energises or drains you. Then optimise your life around it. How?

For me, I find watching pre-recorded lectures a passive task, so I only watch them in the afternoon/at night. I focus on active tasks in the day, such as active recall or writing essays. I also only take meetings in the afternoon or evening.  
To understand yourself, ask yourself these questions:  
\* When am I the most alert? When do I process information fastest?  
\* What tasks do I find exciting? → Do this in the morning.  
\* What tasks require the most mental power to do? → Do this in the morning.  
\* What tasks do I find draining and exhausting? → Push to afternoon/evening.  
\* What information do I recall most effectively? How did I learn this information? → This signals learning techniques that work best for you.  
\* Where am I the most focused? Where do I do my best work?  
**7. Begin with the end in mind**: Understand what you are working towards, before planning how to get there. How?

At the start of every Semester, I would write down all the assignments and their estimated deadlines in my calendar. To get these deadlines, I either turn to the Course Outline or email the Professors directly.  
Also before starting each assignment, I will take a screenshot of the grading rubric and add it to the start of each document. This acts as my North Star. It gives me a clearer idea of what the Professor will be looking out for when grading my work.  
**8. Set internal benchmarks**: Use benchmarks as short-term KPIs you must hit, and be disciplined enough to follow through. How?  
Benchmarks are short-term, internal goals that keep me in line as I progress towards my bigger goals.  
For example, I make sure I internalise each week's material (and their nuances) by the end of the week. Avoid spillover to the next week, so that my backlog won’t snowball.  
When writing essays, I also try to get the first draft out at least 2 weeks before the final deadline, so I have time to expand and edit it.  
**9. Revise by doing, not rote memorising**: Understand the material through active learning. How?  
For theoretical material, practise Active Recall (https://blog.alexanderfyoung.com/active-recall-study-technique/) over mindless rote memorising.  
For practical material like essays or case-based projects, write the material in your own words. Writing the material in your own words help you identify your knowledge gaps and blind spots.  
**10. Be consistent**: Practise the techniques above regularly. How?  
To me, consistency is sticking to a system over a period of time. I stick to a study schedule and system using Google Calendar, Notion and Google Drive.  
To create my study schedule, I set blocks of protected time on Google Calendar. I admit I might not religiously follow my calendar to the minute, but it gives me a sense of my priorities for the day and how I spend my time. To track my progress, I use Notion. I have a daily to-do list on Notion, and my list of deadlines is pinned at the top of my Notion tracker. To write my notes, I use Google Drive as a default.

They are tools, and tools should be learned and used. The problem I'm seeing most of the time with these rants, are that its always the tech, its always the children, I acutally think think its just problem on everyone's part Teachers, Parents, Children, and so on. How are they going to know where stuff is for a computer program if no one bothered to ask them why they think we requested that for them in the first place.  Of course I'm not going to remember how to sew a button if rarely have the need to practice it, this is an example of course. However, its assumed that I should know it as a ""Life Skill"".
Sure they might not want to pay attention to the 30 minutes of Instructions, but have we ever stopped to wonder why its such a Struggles bus? Can it truly fully be the fault of the Children or the Tech, and if it is why is it so Common? In truth I have to ask, why do most of us even know and even regale tales of times Teachers are boring, that we don't want to do the lesson, that we'll never use a subject, and thus writing it off from the front of our mind. Cause I'll be damned if any(many) of you (Excluding Social Studies/Governmental Teachers) could tell me why the industrial revolution occurred and its effects (Or who even started it for that matter.). 

I think Instead, when a student uses Wikipedia, or Chatgpt we should  Question *Them* if *They* think the answer is correct and *Why* trust the answer that they gave. If they say something along the lines of I don't know, then wouldn't it be prudent to take the time to show the supposed student the method of discerning the correct answer? Teach them one of the most important lessons there is to life, that being the ""lesson of learning how to learn"". The phrase I hear from so many other individuals say they don't know how to do, maybe even some of you don't know it. However, that's okay I'm thank you for reading my Ted talk and have a wonderful day.

P.S: I will like to preface this and say if there is any weird wording and or spelling please forgive me, as my ADHD makes typing my thoughts down quite difficult at times. As well I will mention with ADHD, telling a student to search for something doesn't always help.

Hey everyone,

I'm diving into the world of data science, and I've got about a month of self-learning under my belt, and I've learned some intermediate python, including stuff like data manipulation, dictionary based text analysis, and basic data analysis and data visualisation.

I'm a high school student (second year A-Levels), so I'm looking for ways to do freelance data science to earn money while keeping my schedule flexible. I've got an interest in AI and ML, plus a desire to beef up my CV and gain experience working in this field early.

I can't afford courses right now, so I'm learning through YouTube, ChatGPT, and GitHub. Courses are on the horizon once I save up.

Freelancing sounds awesome, but platforms like Upwork are a bit overwhelming. Any tips on breaking into data science, especially on the freelance front? What kind of projects should I go for to build my skills and portfolio?

I'd appreciate your insights and advice – thanks in advance! Also, if you have suggestions on how to frame my questions better or what other communities I should explore, please share.",removed,1
16trf06,1,2023-09-27,CS 1102-01 Programming 1 quality vs. other courses on UoPeople,u/Gh0l4,UoPeople,https://www.reddit.com/r/UoPeople/comments/16trf06/cs_110201_programming_1_quality_vs_other_courses/,"*The following post has been removed with no notice nor explanation from UoPeople internal forum ""Ask the Experts"". I'm reposting here for a bigger audience.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Is ""CS 1102-01 Programming 1"" an especially bad course, or is it representative of the quality of the other classes and the learning dynamics at UoPeople?

&#x200B;

I took This second course after ""Online Education Strategies UNIV 1001"", which I took last year. That course hinted at possible problems with the UoPeople teaching and learning dynamics. However, because I learned quite a bit from the course and found it relevant, I rated that experience as positive despite the many shortcomings.

""CS 1102-01 Programming 1"", in my opinion, is a perfect demonstration of how NOT to create a Java Course or a Programming Course for that matter:

The chosen textbook, Eck (2022), is approaching the subject matter in the wrong way: instead of building concepts upon concepts, it rushes its way into the middle of the language just to pull out before properly finishing the explanations, only to come back some chapters later to add a bit more, but always insufficient context. A safer and more conservative approach would have been to use Eckel (2006).

The Learning Guides only exacerbate the problem by inviting students to skip essential parts and focus on all the irrelevant material. At best, the order in which these topics are presented is incongruent. Then, as the course advances, probably just for ""curriculum"" sake, it rushes through topics such as ""GUIs and Event Handling"", which the professors who built the course considered can be covered in just one week! Another example, on Week 8, is not one but three topics: multithreading, collection hierarchy, and the Stream API! I cannot find proper adjectives for this, not in English, not in my native Spanish or Romanian.

The discussion topics are very consistent in style with the textbook and the learning guides: irrelevant topics utterly unrelated to the skills that, in my opinion, should be gained by will-be programmers or technical writers, for that matter. Some of the proposed discussion as an example:

As an example of Week 4, discussion topic: ""Explore the performance considerations and potential trade-offs involved in this decision, taking into account factors such as time complexity, memory utilization, and code readability"" - Week 5 about Objects and classes, Week 6 will be about ""OOPS Paradigms"", Week 8 about Collections API. Keeping in mind that Microbenchmarking is an extraordinarily subtle and complicated topic and that constant changes in the JVM version have a huge impact on performance, I struggle to understand how could a constructive discussion take place around this topic. Another pearl, this time from Week 5: ""Discuss how encapsulation prevents unauthorized access to object data, ensuring data integrity and privacy"". - My personal conclusion is that the writer had a non-industry-standard definition of ""data integrity"" and ""privacy"". 

In response to the quality of the proposed discussion topics, students respond in kind: some try to summarize the material the best they can. Of course, at each personal interpretation, they make mistakes. Others either use ChatGPT, or they can generate an impressively similar answer to it. Those who work a bit more take that answer and, with more or less effort and talent, spend their time exercising mechanical synonym substitution. As for the responses, most are as automatic as the posts themselves; there is just a tiny percentage of genuine engagement and demonstration of interest in the subject matter.

Since we need to be evaluated, what better way than using the same patterns? Some quiz questions have no relationship with the material covered in the learning guides; the graded quizzes are just a show of how a teacher can give you an ""F"" if he chooses. I would appreciate, after the first graded quiz, an explanation and a discussion on why the correct answer is the one that is. I have at least one example of a question that cannot be solved by reading the textbook, but the concepts behind the correct answer are so subtle that it is just impossible to explain at this level of knowledge of the language. Even if it would be possible to explain by some stretch of imagination, it leaves me wondering why. What is the point of thinking and learning about this language feature so irrelevant instead of other relevant topics that would bring something to the student?

The programming assignments, as it cannot be any other way, are also in line with all the above. For those that don't already know Java, they are an exercise on frustration. For those who know Java, they are not any more rewarding because of how unnecessarily extensive they are and how badly they are framed. Probably, a discussion around each of the submissions would help, but that would mean several knowledgeable people in the group and way shorter problems. For a concrete, non-programming example: ""Cumulative sum of stock prices - Reflects the total value generated by an investment over a specified period."" - I do not think that we need such a high rigour bar, but how is it possible that such assertions even exist in the course material?

But rigour is expected from the students, at least for all those things that can be easily checked and do not need higher intellectual functions: we must always use citations, even if, ironically, they are against the very purpose of the APA Publication Manual 7th edition itself, which reads: ""it helps authors present their ideas in a clear, concise, and organized manner. Uniformity and consistency enable readers to (a) focus on the ideas being presented rather than formatting and (b) scan works quickly for key points, findings, and sources."". Let's avoid addressing the absurdity of using a publication style from one discipline to another very different one, such as Computer Science. Rigour, of course, is paramount when grading: when instructors do not have the time to do so properly, they are left with automatic checking tools for nearly automatic grading.

The importance of my initial question goes beyond requesting information on which I will base my decision to continue or drop from this University. My inquiry concerns how I will eventually evaluate a UoPeople Graduate Student when recruiting. I used to justify to myself that such a student demonstrated maturity because they achieved a University degree in a way more efficient financial manner. If all courses are like this one, what they seem to have shown is an incredible resilience but an utter lack of pragmatism: if anyone would use the time they would spend trying to pass ""CS 1102-01 Programming 1"", to actually learn Java, they would definitely be way prepared to collaborate on a software development team.

I won't deny that we've had a few quarrels over the years, especially after our school trip in which an argument between us almost led me to return back home by myself but I think its unfair that shes started to become continuously strict and unfair with my grading. My latest 10 assignments,, in which I would've usually scored quite high on, started lowering gradually, with remarks such as, ""did you really write this?"" written multiple times on each paper, even in physical assignments in supervised areas. I thought for a while that maybe it was my fault, i did use chatgpt for inspiration and sometimes even a format but doesn't everyone? ive stopped or tried to start using google as an alternative lately as my lowering scores started bothering me and for this work, which is a large part of my grade, i didnt even use chatgpt at all, not even for inspiration. With that being said, she marked the work really low, as in the lowest score I had ever gotten, with almost the whole thing highlighted as, ""written by chatgpt, you did not write this"", so I got pissed off and sent her multiple screenshots of the text going into GPTZero, asking chatgpt itself if it wrote my work, and even comapring gptzero scores with other of my classmates she trusted. I even started to compile testimonies from multiple teachers whom were familiar with my writing style, yet despite all my attempts to reach out to her, she's ignored me and continuously graded my work really low. I think this is ridiculous as in my latest work, of which i worked my ass off (i spent the whole car ride to school writing), a failing grade. I was aware that my work was rushed but I knew my capabilities and this wasnt fair so with everything I had, I asked other english teachers and even talented students what they thought about my work and they all personally marked it quite high so I dont think i was in the wrong or I dont think it was my fault that my work was marked so low. At this moment, I think its obvious what I should do, which is, of course, go talk to her personally. But before that, i'd like some advice on what I should do in this situation, was i in the wrong? What is the best thing I can do? Should i just bite my tongue and switch schools?",User_deleted,1
16ulgun,1,2023-09-28,Please grade my issue essay :) Let's compare to ChatGPT,u/le_vent,GRE,https://www.reddit.com/r/GRE/comments/16ulgun/please_grade_my_issue_essay_lets_compare_to/,"Hi All! I've been working on my issue essay practice using this incredible platform linked at the bottom.  


So far I've been using ChatGPT to grade my essays but would love some human input too :) I'll let you know what score the AI gave me as well so we can explore how useful of a tool it is!  


I've mostly been struggling with time constraints, so any tips are appreciated! I also know that the GRE format just changed, is there anything new to be considered when writing an essay now? Hereby my essay:  


&#x200B;

  
**Prompt:** ""Claim: When planning courses, educators should take into account the interests and suggestions of their students.   Reason: Students are more motivated to learn when they are interested in what they are studying.

Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the claim and the reason on which that claim is based.""

**Essay:** ""Teachers have the responisibility to prepare their students for the challanges they might face after completing their course study. I mostly disagree with the statement that teachers should take student interest into account when planning courses in order to increase motivation. While it is important to evoke passion in students, the experience of teachers places them in a better position to select what topics are essential to the flourishing of the pupil.    


Passion in a topic is a great fuel for learning. When something catches a student's eye as worth understanding, they oftentimes seek out ways to learn it on their own. In these cases, teachers have to do little to convey a topic to the pupil and the teaching job might feel delightfully easy. Einstein, for example, is said to have sought out philosophical writings on the nature of time during his early studies without being prompted to do so by his instructors. He then went on to take the understanding of time in physics beyond anything anyone had ever done. Einstein taught himself a topic he had a proclivity for on his own, and with minimal instruction - a teacher's dream.    


Sadly, important topics do not always attract interest from students. Many subjects rely on a range of foundational fields in order to be understood. In math for example, you cannot learn calculus without haveing understood algebra. Furthermore, calculus is foundational to the understanding of newtonian physics. Einstein, as a physicist, was notoriously bad at math. One can imagine him grinding his teeth when working through his algebra and calculus exercises as a young pupil. But if he would have never engaged with, and integrated, the fundamentals of math, he would have been unable to understand physics in a way that allowed him to revolutionize it.     


Moreover, students lack sufficient in-depth understanding of a topic in order to fully understand whether or not they would find it interesting. Many students picture a wet-lab filled world of microscopes when hearing the word ""biology,"" yet it must not always be so! Biology, like many other fields, is a vast realm of knowledgethat encompasses the study of life at a range of scales. Even if a student might feel repulsed by the squishy cell tissues in a sterilized lab, they might be fascinated by the complex causal relationships that allow oceanic ecosystems to flourish when studying marine biology. A student view on a vast subject before engaging with it is oftentimes too limited to allow for a thorough understanding of potentially intersesting pockets of knowledge.  T  


eachers need to balance student interest in course content with their responsibility to prepare for the challanges that might face after the course ends. While it is essential to maintain interest by cultivating passion, teachers should take students suggestions with regards to planning courses to limited extent. The teacher, with years of life and practicing experience, is in a better position to decide what topics will best engage, prepare and even pleasantly surprise their pupils.""

**AI's Accelerating Impact**

* Compares current pace to the rapid disruption of past tech revolutions.
* Believes AI could master white-collar skills faster than students can learn them.
* Research shows software developer roles are most exposed to generative AI.

**Cause for Concern**

* College may not provide the skills to compete as AI evolves.
* Degrees could become outdated in the 4 years it takes to earn them.
* Echoes fears that AI could automate many current jobs.

**Balancing Innovation and Risks**

* Notes AI like Indeed's helps people find jobs now.
* But it warns that its job-replacing potential requires urgent attention.
* Says we must focus on addressing AI's downsides.

I'm excited to share a project I've been working on. Initially, it started as an investigation game powered by ChatGPT, where you interact with characters to solve mysteries. However, I quickly recognized its educational potential and added an academic mode that corrects student mistakes (see the attached picture) and explains their errors. I'm currently in the launching phase, so everything is free, and I aim to continue offering as much free content as possible. It's an excellent tool for language learning (English, French, Dutch, German, Italian, Portuguese). Would you be interested in a game like this? If you do try it out, please don't hesitate to provide feedback so I can make improvements.

I always had a hard time making friends. High school was tough; I was bullied so relentlessly that I became scared to interact with anyone. College wasn't much different in my first year. I isolated myself, but in the second year, a girl (I'm also a girl) tried to befriend me. At first, I ignored her, but eventually, we became close friends as she shared my interests.

However, she became possessive, always getting aggressive when she saw me with other girls from my class. She'd criticize them, saying they were no good for me. To avoid conflict, I distanced myself from these classmates. While we shared interests, our financial situations differed, with her family struggling financially, and I lived with my parents, granting me more freedom.

As my communication skills improved, I started making more friends, sometimes with her and sometimes without. This change bothered her immensely. She'd get annoyed when I spent time with others and even left me abruptly during a film festival outing, causing me embarrassment.

Things took a darker turn when I noticed she started copying me in various aspects of life. She mimicked my music tastes, joined social media platforms I used, and even showed interest in starting a small business, mirroring my pursuits.

The breaking point came when I invited her to my home during a vacation, and she offended my mother. I took her side, leading to a conflict with my mom. My new well-paid job, combined with my studies and small business, left me exhausted. I befriended another classmate who also juggled part-time jobs, and we shared advice and made plans. This further upset my best friend, who believed she should be my only friend.

Her resentment grew, leading her to complain to our teacher about me copying her assignment. She even let me fall asleep during roll call, resulting in punishment. Worse yet, she attempted to frame me multiple times to tarnish my reputation. Fed up, I asked her not to talk to me, which infuriated her.

She called and texted relentlessly, even complaining to my mom, who was furious. I blocked her, thinking it was over, but upon returning from another vacation, I discovered that dorm students and even some off-campus students were ignoring me. My few close friends revealed that my former best friend had spread rumors about me.

My campus life became a nightmare. She had even manipulated the dorm's housekeeper to report false information to the department authorities. I'm left confused, wondering if it's really wrong to have more than one friend.",removed,0
16wjik6,1,2023-09-30,Can I get some advice on my Statement of Purpose? Applying for SF State for Spring 2024 for Data Science and Machine Learning and the deadline is tomorrow,u/tehsexyone,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/16wjik6/can_i_get_some_advice_on_my_statement_of_purpose/,"With the recent rise in accessibility to Artificial Intelligence based systems, it’s now more important than ever to be prepared for how it will affect everyone’s daily lives. It is for this reason that I’m applying to the Data Science and Machine Learning program at San Francisco State University for the Spring semester of 2024. Through the experience and knowledge I’ve acquired from my undergraduate education until present day, I believe I have a skillset that will not only allow me to prepare for the changes to come, but develop AI with the purpose of helping others prepare as well. I see Artificial Intelligence as a tool that will allow people to do things they couldn’t do before, but a tool that’s still in development and one that requires careful facilitation before it can be used in an effective and ethical manner. 

I graduated from UC Santa Barbara with a Bachelor’s of Science in Physics and a Minor in Mathematics. Ever since High School, I’ve had a fascination with the nature and underlying patterns of mathematics. In 10th grade, I developed a method of interpolating polynomials given a set of numbers by observing the set of differences between each number. In college I opted to expand my knowledge in Math by taking upper division classes such as Numerical Analysis. It was in this class that I learned the language Python and discovered how I could implement my skillset in math to solving computer science problems. During my senior year I took a class on Linear Programming where I worked with partners to solve optimization problems using the program LINGO. Through this experience I got a taste of what it’s like to collaborate on solving math and coding problems in a group setting.

In my time since graduating, I’ve stayed persistent at fostering my skill in math by self studying books on topics I’m interested in. I’ve also worked on independent projects in Python such as one that can solve Ken Ken puzzles using elimination techniques. I believe the ability to translate human thinking into computational logic will be important to have for the Data Science and Machine Learning program. In working on Python projects, I’ve seen what kind of challenges I’ll face when I enter workforce. I’ve also worked as a Math Tutor at Sylvan Learning Center of San Francisco to help students develop the mathematical understanding they will need as developing members of society. In this experience I’ve seen first hand how younger people today are affected by the advent of artificial intelligence, especially in the industry of education.

In the future, I wish to bridge the gap between what computers are able to do and what humans are able to do. One of the biggest limitations I’ve noticed in programs such as ChatGPT and Midjourney is how un-human the creative works tend to be. Humans are good at generating ideas, and computers are good at executing them. I’ve always had a desire to express myself creatively, and I believe that other people are the same. Through getting a Master’s of Science in Machine Learning and entering the workforce, I wish to develop Artificial Intelligence in such a way that it allows people to generate creative ideas that computers can execute on. As AI takes over the job market, more and more focus will have to be put on jobs that require human ideas such as storytelling, which is a personal aspiration of mine. I want to develop tools that will allow people to easily bring their creative ideas to life and share them with people.",User_deleted,2
