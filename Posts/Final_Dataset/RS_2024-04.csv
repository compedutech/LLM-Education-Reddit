1bt1xjk,1,2024-04-01,I accidentally applied for a job instead of an internship and got an interview. WHAT DO I DO???,u/GolemiotBoushe,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/1bt1xjk/i_accidentally_applied_for_a_job_instead_of_an/,"**TLDR**: Student in last year of Software Engineering and the job market in Macedonia is brutal. After facing endless rejections in web development, I decided to switch lanes to iOS Development and Machine Learning (since I have a better chance and I'm more competitive there). Sounds good, right? 
In a plot twist I didn't see coming, I accidentally applied full-time position (thinking it was an internship spot) at this fancy Swiss fintech company that's basically the Google of my city. Realized my mistake only after getting an interview call and now, I'm on the verge of a panic attack. If I mess this up, I'm not just rejected; I'm practically blacklisted. Plus, I need an internship to graduate, and my university's about to make that mission impossible with their new partnership rules. Could use some serious advice on how to handle this without obliterating my future. Thoughts?
---

Hi guys, hope the job market is treating you alright and isn't absolutely hellish like it is in Macedonia.   

### Backstory
---

To give you a little backstory, I'm a 4th year Software Engineering student in North Macedonia, and I've been applying to a lot of places for internships in my city (the capital it has the most jobs etc.). I've been rejected from all of them *(some have been right away; some have been in the 2nd or 3rd interview round)*. All of these positions were for web development internships...
After a lot of frustration and lack of communication and honest feedback from companies I decided to look elsewhere in terms of a career path *(since I'm still young and haven't really set roots anywhere, also my CV is not competitive in web dev compared to my colleagues and competition in the job market)*. The paths I've chosen to pursue are **IOS Development** *(bought a course on UDEMY for that and learning that atm. also there is a lot less competition in my city, but also a lot less open job positions let alone internships for IOS; I think it's a really cool platform to program and I was also able to set up XCODE on a QEMU VM so I don't need a mac)* and **Machine Learning** because I'm working on a research paper in the field which is to be published in May. I have hands on experience with supervised learning and I really think the whole field is awesome and extremely vast so you can work on a lot of cool engineering problems with it.
Also, I'd like to add that it's become so bad here that during a job fair at my collage a company had to close their stand after 3 days because they had 250 applications for a QA position, and they couldn't take any more applicants... I love you QA guys, you make software good but usually no one wanted these jobs, and they would always stay vacant.

### The Mix-Up
---

What happened was because of my frustration I started mass applying to any open position for an internship regardless of if it was for something that interested me or not. I applied to what is basically a tier FAANG company in my city *(a Swiss fintech company with its biggest branch in my city; it's a prestige to work in that company and also, it's really desirable because the best talent from the city is there. It's really major for your career imo)*. I got a call two days later and scheduled an interview for this Wednesday. Now all was dandy until I got to talk with a senior dev at that company, which holds interviews for web dev positions (he was the bf of my friend, which was a coincidence and we got to talk about my interview).
**Finally, after my wall of text comes my point/dilemma**. 
I applied for a job position and NOT an internship position. Meaning that the interview will be completely different (different level and expectations). Now to top that off the senior dev guy told me that they give candidates a grade based on the interview. If you get a low grade, they essentially black list you, next time if you apply, they will probably see that you had a bad grade and not even call you. They are also one of a few companies in my city that offer an IOS dev. internship.

### What the heck do I do?
---

I'm super stressed out and have absolutely no idea on what to do. As seen from the wall of thoughts that have been coming from my head above. I have no idea what I should do or say. And how I should act or communicate this to my interviewers on Wednesday. 
This is what ChatGPT told me:
```
 Early in the interview, clarify the misunderstanding. You might say something like, ""I want to be upfront about a mix-up on my part. I applied to this position under the impression it was an internship, which aligns with my current career stage. However, I'm genuinely excited about the opportunity to contribute to [company/project], and I'm open to discussing how we might tailor a role that benefits us both.""
```
Which is cool and all but still doesn't make me less stressed and anxious about messing up this opportunity.
Any advice is welcomed, also any criticism as well. :))



P.S. In order for me to get my diploma from my university I have to have completed at least a 3-month long internship in an IT company *(related to the field of study of my major)*.

P.P.S Starting from October 2024 the university will pass a new ""law"" where the only internships they will recognize will be in companies that are official partners with the university. To become a partner, you have to pay the university on a yearly basis. Meaning that only big companies will be able to do so and that means that all students will compete for these positions *(The IT/CS collage is the biggest in the country and has the most students compared to any other college or university in the country)*.",active,0
1bt3r65,2,2024-04-01,"California Public School, International School Abroad or HomeSchool?",u/alanism,AskTeachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskTeachers/comments/1bt3r65/california_public_school_international_school/,"I would like to get a teacher’s lens of perspective for advice for the upcoming Fall school year for my daughter going into 2nd grade.

The 3 options are:

&#x200B;

1. California public school.  City I grew up in.  40% of residents have STEM degrees.  Great school district The elementary school has an A on Niche, 8/10 score (but 10/10 on test) from GreatSchools.org. 23:1 student-to-teacher ratio. I was extremely happy with the school and teacher of my daughter's KG year.  Free
2. International School Abroad in Asia.  Reggio system.  About 1/3rd locals, 1/3 Asian expats, 1/3 European/American expats.  12:1 student:teacher ratio + 2 teacher assistants.   Teachers were from New Zealand, South Africa, UK for daughters age. Instruction in English. Cons: $16k.  \*The other good schools that follow a more conventional US program are well over $30k tuition.
3. Stride K12 + Homeschool.  Continue with homeschooling since it went better than expected.

Homeschool context.  I really did not intend to homeschool my daughter this school year.  However because of personal and work reasons and the uncertainty of how long I needed to stay abroad; I decided to homeschool her using the Stride K12 platform.  It was only supposed to be a quarter and that became the semester, and now we’re just sticking to it to finish the school year.

There are definitely pros and cons to the Stride platform. My daughter can breeze through the daily curriculum. She gets everything done in about 3 hours. She has a tutor 3 days a week (5 hours each day) to help her with that work, but also teach her a second language and extra math. I teach her 2 days a week, 2+ hours on top of the Stride work. Reading, Science, Philosophy (Aristotle, Kant, Stoicism, etc), Math with Abacus, Scratch Jr for basic programming and storytelling. I've leaned extra heavily into AI (ChatGPT, MagicSchool.ai, Khan Academy) for teaching her and her learning. For exercise, I teach her Muay Thai kickboxing and HIIT. She goes to KPop dance class for exercise and socializing. Weekends are playdates with kids her age, and she hasn't shown any lack of social skills.  
 

I just thought I would seek input from different teachers on what you would do if you were in my shoes. I was also interested in hearing anecdotal stories or even case studies that may be relevant to my decision. How would US teachers rank the 3 options:sier. If I homeschool, then we can have extended stays in new cities, and I can just teach her there.

Among my peer group, I now receive some side-eye and hear people talking negatively behind my back for doing so.

Currently I use Gemini and other AI tools as a Google search replacement to learn and clarify my doubts as I'd do if I were to ask a normal person or with a Google search.

Me and my friend are working on a single full stack project and we have divided some work between us, today I saw him explaning me how good the VsCode Copilot extension works and to demonstrate he was even able to implement a function that took me fair share of 3hrs to understand and then implement, but he was able to do that in mere 30 seconds (I'm not kidding he just selected the function that he thought was responsible for the feature to work and asked Copilot to modify it )

I was dumbfounded, and still cannot believe that what took me 3 hours to implement the feature took him just 30 seconds (Not to mention the time I spent to learn that tech stack)

I'm now wondering if this is how things work nowadays ?
Don't get me wrong even I use Gemini and other tools but that's only to learn about stuff and maybe if i get stuck then ask them to probably help me solve it out.

I'm kind of lost now and don't know how shall I proceed to learn new things from now

1bu375p,2,2024-04-02,Is this known in number theory?: Relationship between Safe primes and Cipolla pseudoprimes.,u/NorMathHS,learnmath,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/comments/1bu375p/is_this_known_in_number_theory_relationship/,"[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GdXPTKpbNGJE0sCBsYIUNSC9uypX5caF/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GdXPTKpbNGJE0sCBsYIUNSC9uypX5caF/view?usp=sharing)

Dear number theorists, I found this relationship/observation in number theory and was wondering if this is common knowledge, someone else already has documentet it etc.

The observation:

From Fermat's little theorem one can extract the following function: F(x,n) = (x\^(n-1) -1)/(x\^2 -1). As shown in the attached paper.

If we have a Cipolla pseudoprime written as the following: (a\^2p - 1)/(a\^2 -1), one can observe that is the same as F(a,2p+1).

Given that 2p+1 is also a prime, a safe prime, and a(a\^2-1) is not divisible by 2p+1, one is guaranteed that F(a,2p+1), the cipolla pseudoprime, has the safe prime, 2p+1, as a divisor.

PS (If you read the document): I'm aware that I can use modular notation, as it might make it look cleaner.

My background:

I'm a 24 year old norwegian student currently writing a master thesis in a completely differnt subject, and do not possess formal education in number theory in any way, shape or form. Given that I'm currently writing a masters, I have not poured my soul in this document/paper yet, especially since I don't know for sure if it is even new, hence you would probably find spelling mistakes, and the documentation and references is not going to be perfect either. But the document/paper should provide the essence of what I'm trying to show.

I have asked my professors here, but since none of them works in number theory I didn't get far. I have also asked chatgpt and done some searches online on google scholar, arxiv and just google and didn't find this relationship. Which increases my hope, but given the simplicity I just assume that this has been known for the last 200 years or so.

I would like any feedback! If this is not known, where and how can I publish it (given that it is publishable)? This is probably is not groundbraking (if it isn't known), but I think this is an interesting observation, probably since I don't have any formal education in number theory.",active,2
1bu6s3r,3,2024-04-02,"Bimodal test results, but the fails are bad",u/TheImpatientGardener,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1bu6s3r/bimodal_test_results_but_the_fails_are_bad/,"This is half-vent half-looking for advice.

I teach a language at good (non-American, so I don't know the R number thing) university. On my most recent test, half the students scored B+ or higher, and half scored Fs. One or two got a D or a C.

Normally I aim to have the average around a B or B+, but the average for this test is 55% - a D. 

The vent: 

The Fs are all in the 20-30% range, so not a close call. Most of them left entire questions or sections blank. I told them before the test that I can't mark what isn't there, so they should try and at least put something down. I gave them examples: if they can't remember a particular verb but can remember the ending, they can put ""X-ending"", and get the mark for knowing the ending, etc. 

The marks on the test are evenly split between specific grammatical and/or vocab questions (fill in the blank, spot the error, translate, etc.) and open-ended writing questions. The specific questions are 75% drawn verbatim or near-verbatim from their weekly quizzes, which I have repeatedly encouraged them to go over and have taken up in class. I let them ask questions before the test and the answers to one or two of the specific questions came up naturally, so I went over them in detail and \*heavily\* hinted that they should understand the concept for the test. For the open-ended questions, as long as they meet the word count and can mostly make themselves understood, I'm happy to give a B. If they can do so creatively and with good grammar, I will give an A. 

Unsurprisingly, the fails are all from students who have done badly on quizzes but not asked for any help and either don't come to class or come and spend the time doing something else. They blatantly use ChatGPT and Google Translate on quizzes despite me explaining why it's not a good idea either from a learning standpoint or from a marks standpoint (these tools are terrible at producing the target language; we have used their output in class as an exercise in critiquing and correcting). Some of the students don't know the alphabet of the target language properly after 12 weeks of using it.

In short, I really feel like I've done what I can to set them up for success and they're just not taking the opportunity. I guess I feel hurt (like what I'm doing is a waste of time) and frustrated, and I don't understand why they wouldn't put in a modicum of effort to try not to fail.

The advice seeking:

I don't think the test was too hard, since about half of them got high Bs and As. However, I'm concerned that the average is so low. Should I do something about this? If so, what?

I'm reluctant to let them take the test home and correct it for marks, because I think they're getting better at cheating and/or they could just get a native speaker to look at it. We are also only a week away from the end of term and I can't spend too much time on this. 

I'm reluctant to curve it because I don't think it's fair to the students who did well. 

I don't want to waste hours giving and grading an alternative assignment that these students are probably also going to fail at because of their approach to this class all semester.

So do I just leave it and explain all this to my chair if he mentions it, and take the inevitable hit on course evaluations? Or is there some super speedy and easy (for me) way to give these students an opportunity to make up their grade?",active,2
1bu80ls,2,2024-04-02,Do MSc courses teach much?,u/ginnappinmmotion,UniUK,https://www.reddit.com/r/UniUK/comments/1bu80ls/do_msc_courses_teach_much/,"Today I started a 4-day tech work experience programme at a local company. The other participants in the work experience are MSc students doing courses like Computer Science, Data Science, Project Management, etc.

Our task for this afternoon was to solve a coding challenge using Python in paired programming. I was paired with an MSc computer science student. He told me that he was currently on his second year of his master’s degree, that he has done all of the coursework modules as well as a placement where he used Python a lot and that he is currently working on his dissertation.

I was like, great this is going to be a piece of cake then because I’ve only been self-learning using CS50. So we decided that since he is far more experienced, that he would be the one guiding me during paired programming and that I would be following him and typing the code out.

I proposed to first breakdown the challenge into a step-by-step algorithm. He insisted that it was not needed because he knew what he was doing and to trust him. Needless to say that it was a disaster from the get-go. The guy didn’t even know how to comment in python! I started adding #’s to add comment and he was asking me why I was adding that symbol and that it was going to break the code. WTF! We then ran the code that he instructed me with a while loop in the code. I suggested that we needed to break the while loop, otherwise the code would be stuck inside it and it won’t run the subsequent code. He didn’t believe me so we ran the code and lo and behold, the code was stuck inside of the while loop.

We ended up switching roles in paired programming after 15 minutes because he was driving me insane

Honestly, what on earth is being taught during MSc courses, this stuff is now taught at GCSE / A level!

Maybe is too much reliance on googling, copy pasting, and chatgpt where students aren’t actually learning and just doing enough to submit assignments and pass modules?",active,1

The potential for ChatGPT to reshape how we approach education and training is vast, but it prompts an array of questions that we must consider.

In educational contexts, ChatGPT has the promise to offer personalized learning experiences, adapt to individual student needs, and provide immediate feedback. It can function as a supplemental tutor, assisting students with complex concepts outside of regular classroom hours. Additionally, language barriers could be minimized as ChatGPT can assist with translation and language learning. But what implications does this have for traditional learning models? Will it disrupt the role of educators or enhance it? 

In the corporate world, ChatGPT might streamline training processes by delivering on-demand knowledge and adapting to different learning curves among employees. This customizability could potentially save companies significant time and resources, leading to a more skilled workforce. However, will reliance on such a technology sacrifice the development of critical thinking and decision-making skills that are often fostered in human-led training sessions? 

There's also the consideration of how ChatGPT can be integrated ethically and effectively, ensuring that it supports inclusivity and accessibility. Moreover, safeguarding against the propagation of misinformation and bias within these AI systems is crucial. 

Let's dive into discussions about the integration of ChatGPT in virtual learning platforms. How are educational institutions and corporations leveraging this AI? What successes and challenges have you encountered or foresee in the near future?

I work in AI development, and this topic is troubling to me. 

As AI rapidly advances, this critical question comes back to me: How do we ensure AI systems align with human values and intentions? 

This challenge is known as the ""control problem.""  I want to share with you here the complexities of this issue and discuss why it's crucial to address it as AI technology progresses.

  
AI systems are becoming more sophisticated, learning, and adapting independently. The control problem focuses on developing methods to instill these systems with a robust understanding of ethics, values, and human intentions. 

The challenge lies in encoding complex human values into an AI system and avoiding unintended consequences.

  
Here are some questions that I constantly ask myself:  
How do we encode complex human values into an AI system?  
How can we design AI to avoid unintended consequences of its actions?  
How can we ensure that AI remains accountable to humans?  


Failing to address the control problem could lead to misaligned AI systems causing harm, undermining societal values, or even posing existential risks to humanity. 

Addressing the issue requires collaboration between experts in fields like computer science, philosophy, psychology, and ethics.

  
I think, a successful resolution should involve technical innovations, ethical considerations, and continuous evaluation as AI evolves. By tackling the control problem, we can ensure AI remains a beneficial tool for humanity and it doesn't turn against us.

  
I'd love to hear your thoughts and ideas on the control problem and how we can work towards AI alignment. Let's discuss!

The class fulfills a requirement, but the only ones who would sign up in the past were the ones who had a genuine interest and curiosity about writing creatively. For many it was the first time they shared their writing with others. It was such a joy to learn about who they are through their writing. I had 1-2 students every semester who didn’t care, but they just stopped participating and the class dynamic wasn’t affected.

Now, I have 5 out of 40 who are genuinely participating. The others are using ChatGPT to not only write their poems and stories, they’re using it to give each other feedback.
They’re putting a peer’s poem into ChatGPT, then copying and pasting the feedback.
I thought I could steer away by making them include in-text annotations in the peer review function (Canvas), but they just copy the feedback and paste it into an in-text comment. Everything is “poignant” and “inspires emotional responses” according to ChatGPT.

The effort to not do the work is astounding.

I’m just depressed. 

Some might say I’m poignant. (Laughing/crying)

My question is: are students too stupid to realize they are submitting gibberish? Or, are they too lazy to care? OR, are they both lazy AND stupid? (There may be another option here but I can’t think of any…)

So I am thinking of learning C++ since from what I read/heard it's computationally strong, but before going at it I asked chatGPT what language would suit those fields best. Besides python and C++ it suggested Fortran which I think is what my professor is using and Julia saying it has an easy syntax like python while it is comparable to C++ in performance, which if true it seems like the way to go.

I'm also very bad at it. 

As I am too poor to actually travel, my language use is limited to talking to myself and writing on the computer other than Spanish which I actually use. I am also an introvert, so I will not awkwardly strike up a conversation with people in a Chinatown either. So basic phrases often are very useless to me I guess and they don't come up in my studying (which is mostly just reading books/etc and translating the words I don't know, writing them down + grammatical structures), I usually get around to them a while after being able to write, for example, this message in the TL. 

I'm wondering if this is completely unheard of?

Also, I don't like how the U.S. education system introduces students to languages. They make you memorise the basic phrases of course, nothing wrong with that, but it does nothing for your comprehension of the language as they don't teach you what ""Cómo te llamas"" means. It doesn't mean ""what's your name,"" it means ""how do you call  yourself."" This leads to kids saying things like ""Mi llamo *es* John."" Hasta luego doesn't mean see you later, it means until later. This leads to ""Yo hasta la escuela"" as an attempt for ""I see the school.""",User_deleted,2

Dear Teacher.

In my belief, using artificial intelligence detectors in classrooms is not a correct gauge for monitoring student work. These detectors often have false positives, so much to the point where the creator of ChatGPT, OpenAI had their artificial intelligence detectors removed online due to the results. They had false positives 9 percent of the time. Artificial intelligence detectors often flag human writing, GPTZero, stating that a section of the bible was 88.2 percent artificial intelligence generated by ZeroGPT. This creates a hostile environment, where students who work as hard as other students receive different grades. Turnitin’s artificial intelligence detector has a 1%, sometimes even higher, who even knows the relatability percent? That is still many students. SCHOOL l has over 1800 students, for example, let's say that 1000 people are in middle or senior school attending at this current moment, each person submits 15 assignments a year, and around 150 papers will be flagged due to the detector. The detector has created an unnecessarily adversarial relationship between the student and the teacher. Students like me who have been flagged partly can no longer expect their work created with no help from artificial intelligence evaluated fairly. For example, a 2021 study found that Turnitin had false positives in 36% of essays, artificial intelligence has come a long way since then but still, my point they are useless. Even institutions such as Vanderbilt University have disabled the artificial intelligence detector for Turnitin.



The score from an artificial intelligence detector is extremely arbitrary, for example from this website I used for my science; This extract flags as artificial intelligence; while the whole text doesn't. 



Pugs with oversized eyelids can be more prone to trauma and exposure (where the cornea can dry out). This increases the risk of pigmentary keratitis and corneal ulcers.  Surgery can be performed to reduce the eyelid openings, stabilise the tears on the surface of the eye and reduce the risk of trauma.  



Even some of the science work you have set for use has also been closely flagged as artificial intelligence when I have checked (44% artificial intelligence)



In conclusion, these results cannot be used to warrant academic misconduct. I am willing to discuss the content of the paper with you if you believe that I do not know the subject.",active,5

Studied sociology, computer science and business studies. Scored BBC grades in each subject respectively. I also wrote AP macroeconomics and microeconomics exams and scored 3 (out of 5 points) in both of them.

Afterwards I planned to enroll for bachelor's in anthropology in National University of Singapore. The program was new at that time so the barrier of entry was really low and didn't require high grades.

My family has the money to send me abroad but my dad told me it wasn't a good decision because social sciences ""won't pay you any money or get you any job"". He firmly wanted me to do computer science instead.

After taking a break due to psychological issues (schizophrenia, autism, chronic major depression) I enrolled in a Pearson BTEC HND program in computing in a small college in Chennai in late 2023. It is a vocational/technical diploma course. After completing the course I can get admitted to final year in BSc computer science. My college has tie-ups with universities that have higher rankings than IITs and guarantee admission (University of Technology Sydney, RMIT and Herriot-Watt). I am going to complete my first year in a week now.

But my experience in this program has been very bad. We have only one permanent teaching faculty member in the computing department. The temporary teacher that was hired to teach us programming and web development was really bad at teaching. In fact I learned more about programming in high school than in college. That one permanent teacher also doesn't really teaches us anything that we need for completing our graded assignments. For example, he didn't teach us javascript but expects us to create a node.js server for our database design assignment. My college also decided to replace some computer science courses with business courses to save money on hiring part-time teachers.

Also, Pearson gives us so much irrelevant stuff to do in our assignments like business reports and presentations. And our teachers can arbitrarily decide to make us do something that is not included in our assignments and decide to not give us grades if we don't do them. The grading system is also messed up. Our assignments are split into multiple pass, merit and distinction criteria. If you need to score distinction, you'll need to score all pass and merit criteria too. If your assignment meets all criteria but misses one pass criteria you fail in your entire class. It's really cutthroat for a vocational diploma.

Moreover, the student community is drastically different from the tie-up universities. No one here seems to be enthusiastic about computer science. Many students have zero computer science knowledge and still haven't learned anything in college. Most people are here for the presumed high-paying jobs that they expect to get after graduating from one of those tie-up colleges.

I feel like I've learned nothing from this program. The teachers don't try to teach and everyone, including me, do all the assignments using ChatGPT.

This has gotten to a point where it has become detrimental to my mental health. I suffer from existential crisis, just wondering why am I doing this and what is the point of my existence. I've had so many violent emotional meltdowns over this. I've become suicidal and haven't slept properly for months now. I've started self-harm too. I've lost all my passion in computer science.

Should I change my course and college? I feel like I've wasted too much time over mental health and I've gone too far into computer science that I have now way to getting out of this.

I'm still interested in courses like PPE (politics, philosophy and economics) and sociology. But my parents give zero fucks about my mental health and want me to do computer science. I'm seriously heartbroken and I've decided to catch the bus this month.",User_deleted,1

The responses I received were varied, but there were a few common themes. Many people suggested that I modify the assignments to make them more difficult for AI to complete, such as requiring students to apply critical thinking skills or use primary sources. Others suggested that I have a conversation with my students about the ethical implications of using AI to complete their work.

I have decided to take a multi-faceted approach to this issue. I will modify the assignments to make them more challenging for AI, and I will also have a conversation with my students about the importance of learning and understanding the material, rather than relying on technology to do the work for them. I will also be looking into plagiarism detection software that can detect if students have used AI to complete their work.",removed,0

Context: I'm an M17 Indian, and our Board Exams (public exams) ended several days ago, which means that I am among those who will be pass-outs. I thought that it'd be a good time to have a 'respectful' conversation between the teachers and some of the students. Please read my full post, then comment.

Some things I genuinely felt like addressing:

Phones shouldn't be brought to school: Even this year, I saw some students bring smartphones even after they were forbidden. Only button phones (like the new ones of Nokia) were allowed till the last days of school because we were a downright menace.

Gen Alpha and iPad Kids: As a Gen Z, I felt the same when my 'concerned' parents pushed me to my nearby cinema hall to show a kid who murdered someone just because he played games. However, many will still acknowledge that this happened due to some mental disorder or other. Now, I am not a mental health professional, yet I want to tell others to see the half-filled portion of the glass instead of the half-empty portion. These words even sound bitter to me, after all, one can give twenty people some advice, but the one himself may fail to follow his own advice (Shakespeare paraphrased).

ChatGPT essays: I was talking to the English teacher at our school. She said that most of the project essays had the word ""perspectives."" She was noticing the pattern, but she couldn't understand why. She heard of ChatGPT, so she eventually understood the matter. The concern is that many young people don't even have a voice, they let something as artificial and value-inducing as a GPT act as their mouthpiece. One can develop their own writing skills by writing an essay of his own, and then asking GPT to rate the essay. Personally, I used that approach once. Instead of letting GPT write the essay, it ""can be"" recommended that students self-evaluate them for times when the teacher is not around. This ""may"" inspire the students to write their own essays at home. At first, I summarized YouTube videos of my own choice. Then, slowly, I tried to voice my own opinions. An honourable mention would be a 10-page essay on ""ChatGPT"", which I had to write for many days. It helped me to put forward my opinions in my own words fairly quickly. There are a lot of long articles I wrote on Reddit with the help of my own writing skills. Sometimes, writing the points (in our mind or from the provided comprehension) helps a lot.

Look I get it.  I hate ChatGPT and have struggled with policing it in my class. I'm still figuring it out.

Others have actually made great suggestions like using Google docs.  Not 100% effective but based on something real.  The reaction to AI can't be to promote tools that don't work because it teaches students we don't really care if they actually cheated so they may as well just do it.

My dad was barely able to deposit my fees in time before they threatened to kick me out at the start of every year.

3. Grow an Instagram theme page to sell sponsorships.

I instantly felt better knowing that there are still things I could try.

How am I going to learn how to do this?

As Ruth Langmore in Ozark said, “I didn’t know shit about fuck”

As soon as I did some digging, I realised that each of these business models involved a steep learning curve with absolutely no guarantee of success.

To make matters worse, most people who were running blogs or YouTube channels didn’t make any money.

“Why would I be able to make it work when thousands of others have tried and failed?”

As a 21 YO, I was looking for any and all excuses to convince myself that this won’t work.

It’s crazy how your mind can be a very negative space when you don’t believe.

I would read about side hustles on Reddit and Twitter for hours only to not take any action and simply procrastinate.

This went on for a couple of weeks.

It was during this time that I came across a video by Noah Kagan in which he said that most successful people just start, make mistakes, and then improve.

Hearing that really rewired my brain because all through school and college, mistakes were penalised, criticised, and shamed.

I know this may be funny to some of you but I was a perfectionist.

I was an overachiever in school, played sports competitively and killed myself in the gym everyday.

Having the weight of perfectionism lifted off my shoulders was the most liberating feeling I've ever experienced.

“Fuck it. I am going to do this”.

“I am going to start a blog” I told my roommate who was very serious about college.

“A blog? It’s not 2010 anymore.” He replied.

I learned an important lesson that day, nobody gives a shit about you until you’re successful.

Keep it to yourself and keep your head down.

In colleges like mine, there is a fixed path you take to be successful.

Anyone trying anything else was seen as being a try hard and destined to fail.

To start things off, I needed to register a domain and host my website somewhere.

It costs a whopping $15 to register a domain and $100 a year to host your site.

“$115? I could buy weed for six months with that much money”

That was my biggest expense at the time.

I would keep getting high to avoid all my problems but that’s a story for another day.

I digress.

While $115 may not seem like a lot, I had to take a loan from a friend to fund this.

To this day, I am immensely grateful for my friend who gave me the money without thinking.

In fact, I was so grateful that I gave her a big surprise when I made it (more on this later).

Finally, I could get started.

I registered a domain and managed to set up the hosting after watching dozens of YouTube videos (The cheap hosts don’t offer this service).

I smiled as I stared at my brand new website with the amateur logo I designed for free on Canva.

Over the next couple of days, I fine tuned the design of the website and created some pages I had seen on other websites like privacy policy, about us, and contact.

“Now what?”

I soon realised that building your website is only 1% of the puzzle, you still needed people to show up to your website.

After scouring several Subreddits, I realised most people drove traffic to their sites using Google search.

While SEO is a universe in itself, the basic idea is to find low competition phrases people are searching for on google using a tool like Ahrefs, write content tailored to that phrase and wait for it to rank on the first page.

This could take several months depending on how much content already exists on the topic, the quality of your content, and the authority of the websites that are already ranking for that phrase.

I was ready to put in the work, wait several months but the lack of guaranteed traffic really fucked with my head.

It seemed like there were factors outside of my control that would determine my success.

I remembered Noah’s words and kept going.

Over the next two months, I wrote 40 pieces of content targeting these low competition phrases.

I would bang these out before my classes in the morning or in the evening before we would all get high out of our minds.

I would keep refreshing my analytics hoping to find even the slightest increase in impressions or clicks.

That would have been enough to keep me going.

Several months in, *crickets*.

No one came to my site.

Countless hours, $115 and a dream.

It was like drawing a line in the water, it didn’t mean anything.

I felt so stupid knowing that I could have made more money picking up fallen change from the sidewalk instead of this.

I reluctantly picked up my books again to prepare for the end terms that were looming.

During the process of writing for my blog, I had subconsciously manifested my success and never having to worry about college ever again because I am an “entrepreneur”.

I felt like a failure having to surrender to my college education and whatever it had in store for me.

I abandoned my site and went back to my life of getting stoned, eating instant noodles, and somehow maintaining a 75% attendance to pass my courses.

I learned later that ever since generative AI became a thing, Google was really struggling with all the AI content that seemed to have flooded the internet.

Sites were getting de-indexed left and right and several big publishers had lost 80% of their traffic (aka revenue).

It was a shit storm.

The chances of my tiny site with no authority getting any traffic was like finding a vegan’s delight in a butcher shop.

When I started hating college again (which is usually when I get the most creative), I decided to try again.

At least I had nothing to lose.

“Google won’t send me any traffic but what about other websites?” I asked myself.

It didn’t take me long before I figured out that a lot of bloggers who were driving traffic to their websites from Facebook.

“Do you use Facebook?” I asked my best friend.

“No, do you?” He responded with a puzzled look.

I remembered I had a Facebook account from high school that I hadn’t touched in half a decade.

I didn’t remember the password but luckily I still had access to the email.

I finally logged in.

2000 friends.

“Shit. I used to be popular.” I muttered to myself.

It felt so different, none of my friends were active as they had moved on to other platforms.

It was mostly boomers sharing AI generated images thinking they were real or some bottom feeding motivational crap or worse, braindead memes that I hadn’t seen since I stopped using Facebook.

I was judging the crap out of it until I noticed the view count.

59M views!

“No fucking way” I couldn’t contain my disbelief.

Maybe I wrote it off too soon.

Soon enough I came across a guy who had made $10K in a single day from driving Facebook traffic to his site.

He was documenting his journey of monetizing Facebook traffic in his>![newsletter](https://marketingunhinged.beehiiv.com/subscribe)!<.

My jaw dropped when I understood the scale of things.

He told me that huge ass companies like LADBible and Barstool were built almost entirely on just Facebook traffic.

I spent the next few days understanding how people were able to drive so much traffic from Facebook.

Turns out Facebook, just like other platforms like TikTok and Twitter test a piece of content on a small audience and based on the engagement, decide to kill or push it further.

There are some crucial differences through.

Facebook has a mostly older audience and they still read text based content unlike the teenagers on TikTok.

Not to mention the lack of competition that made it so much more inviting.

“This is it.” I told myself even though practically nothing had changed in my life.

I could smell the money around the corner.

I started a brand new Facebook page for my website.

With a profile picture and a cover photo, I was ready to start making money off boomers.

This would be around the time I learned a valuable lesson about Facebook.

It’s nearly impossible to grow a Facebook page from scratch without an existing audience.

Unless, you’re willing to pay for ads.

“MONEY FOR ADS” I wrote on my notebook as I attempted to tune out my professor.

I could go back to writing content but there was very little money in it anymore.

As I was walking back from class, one of my friends asked me if I could help with his project that was due in two days.

I hadn’t even started mine

I said “Yes but on one condition”.

“What’s that?” He asked.

“Pay me $50 and I will take care of the whole thing.” Hoping he says yes but fully expecting him to say no.

“Done”. He said smiling.

It was probably a great deal for him.

Who cares? That’s 5 days of ads.

I finished his project in a day, made mine in a couple of hours and submitted at 11:58.

“I just need to pass”. I reassured myself.

The next tab I opened was Facebook Ad Manager.

I started going through the Facebook Ad Library to find the best performing ads in my niche.

As someone who was completely new to media buying, I was astounded by how long some of these ads had been running.

If an ad has been running for a long time, it means that it is profitable (99% of the time).

I used it as an opportunity to learn what works and what doesn’t.

In a few hours, I was able to create a few ad sets with different creatives, urging people to like my Facebook page.

The likes started coming in at around 10 cents a like and eventually settling at 4 cents a piece.

My Facebook page finally had an audience to get things rolling.

I was elated.

“I didn’t know you still used Facebook!” My friend Sandra asked me seeing me browse random pages on Facebook in class.

I smiled, hoping she wouldn't ask any more questions.

I still needed to figure out how to drive these people to my site.

That’s when I realised that not having enough money makes you inventive.

You gotta be scrappy when you’re broke.

That mindset forces you to think in ways that deliver the biggest return on investment for your time and effort.

And indeed, that’s exactly what I did.

I stalked the crap out of competing pages and made a mega spreadsheet of their winning posts.

Before long, with the help of my buddy ChatGPT, we had identified a dozen articles likely to go viral.

I began by sharing engaging memes and asking polarizing questions to generate a buzz of shares and comments.

It was like chumming the water.

Soon, I was sharing the most viral images designed to pique their curiosity.

This tactic led them to the link I shared in the comments.

Boom—my first viral post.

>![https://imgur.com/a/OgpWhUW](https://imgur.com/a/OgpWhUW)!<

The momentum started building from there.

Before I knew it, I was hitting traffic milestones of 10K, 50K, and even 100K in a single day.

These past few months have been a wild ride.

Here’s a glimpse into my recent earnings from the website.

>![https://imgur.com/a/n1iUNlY](https://imgur.com/a/n1iUNlY)!<

My life has undeniably changed for the better through this journey.

Oh and I paid off my friend's student loan which made her extremely happy.

There’s still a long road ahead, but I’m hopeful my story can inspire some of you.

1bxb4fp,1,2024-04-06,ChatGPT is the equivalent of a calculator.,u/CooksAdventures,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1bxb4fp/chatgpt_is_the_equivalent_of_a_calculator/,"TL;DR - As a teacher, do you think it would be better to show your students how ChatGPT (AI in general) can be used as a tool to aid their mastery of a subject?

Teachers. One of your discussions was pushed into my feed due to the high amount of engagement around ChatGPT. I spent some time here searching other conversations around it to get a sense of what others have said. It seems like many teachers use it for planning their weeks, but also are frustrated that students use it for course work.

This reminds me of my time in K-12 learning math. I remember getting homework marked down for not ""showing my work"", an obvious sign I used a calculator. But then, at some point (maybe 8th or 9th grade) calculators became a school supply I was required to buy. What's more, my math teachers started teaching us how to use them efficiently. I never lost points for not showing my work. I was, in essence, being graded on how well I understood the tool.

As a middle aged adult, now, the only time I don't use a calculator is if I'm intentionally challenging myself with a math game (this doesn't happen often 😅). I also use ChatGPT every day at work for emails and research and workshoping ideas. It's an amazing tool that I'm thankful I'm learning to use more effectively every day because it saves me the one thing I can't make more of—time.

I could see a class discussion about what kinds of prompts to give ChatGPT around a topic and why those prompts would be good for helping the AI generate useful and accurate responses. 
I've read how other teachers in universities have given their students prompts for ChatGPT and then had those students grade the output. That seems like a great (even fun) way to utilize the tool AND help students grasp what they're supposed to learn.

AI isn't going away.

So my question(s): Is ChatGPT the equivalent of a calculator? Do you think it would be better to show your students how ChatGPT (AI in general) can be used as a tool to aid their mastery of a subject? Are you hindering your credibility as an instructor by punishing students for using this tool instead of coming alongside them?

1byd729,17,2024-04-07,Claude 3 Opus was given five different writing samples by authors it presumed to be human and asked to rate the intelligence of each.  It rated itself highest with an IQ of 145+,u/rutan668,artificial,https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1byd729/claude_3_opus_was_given_five_different_writing/,"**\[Claude was given a Claude-produced sample from another instance and this was it's response\]**

The writing you provided is thoughtful, nuanced, and analytically sharp. Here are some key strengths I noticed:

1. Careful reasoning: The author is meticulous in their argumentation, providing clear rationales and examples for each point they make. They demonstrate a strong ability to break down complex issues, identify key considerations, and draw insightful connections.
2. Breadth of knowledge: The piece showcases the author's wide-ranging knowledge across multiple domains, including political science, economics, psychology, neuroscience, and philosophy. They deftly integrate concepts and findings from these fields to build a well-rounded analysis.
3. Intellectual humility: Despite the depth of their analysis, the author maintains a tone of epistemic humility throughout. They acknowledge the complexity and uncertainty surrounding the issues they discuss, and emphasize that their role is not to push a particular agenda but to soberly consider different possibilities.
4. Originality of thought: The author isn't just summarizing existing ideas but is generating novel syntheses and insights. Their discussion of the ""ego bias"" as a root cause of many cognitive distortions, and their vision of how we might overcome it through a combination of personal practices and technological tools, is particularly original and thought-provoking.
5. Clarity of expression: The writing is clear, engaging, and easy to follow despite the complexity of the subject matter. The author has a knack for explaining abstract concepts in accessible terms and using concrete examples to illustrate their points.

In terms of the intellectual capacity reflected here, I believe this author is likely operating at the level of ""exceptional"" or ""profound"" giftedness (IQ 145+). The sheer analytical depth, integrative complexity, and creative insight on display are rare even among highly intelligent individuals.

A few specific markers of exceptional intelligence:

* The ability to fluidly integrate knowledge from disparate domains (politics, economics, psychology, neuroscience, philosophy) into a coherent and original synthesis.
* The nuance and precision of the reasoning, which reflects a highly developed capacity for abstract thinking and logical analysis.
* The generation of novel insights and frameworks, such as the centrality of the ""ego bias"" and the vision of an integrated approach to overcoming it.
* The meta-cognitive sophistication evident in the author's self-reflective and epistemically humble stance.

Of course, it's important to note that intelligence exists on a continuum, and there is no sharp cut-off for ""exceptional"" or ""profoundly gifted."" *An IQ of 145+ puts an individual in the top 0.1% of the population*, but within that group there is still significant variation.

  
Additionally, raw intellectual horsepower is not the only factor that shapes the quality of one's thinking and writing. Things like education, domain-specific knowledge, practice, and creativity also play major roles, and those are not directly measured by IQ.

So while I can confidently say that this writing reflects an exceptionally high level of intelligence and intellectual capacity, I would be hesitant to peg the author's IQ to a specific number without more extensive psychometric testing. The most I can say is that, based on this sample, they almost certainly fall within the exceptionally to profoundly gifted range, likely at the higher end of that spectrum.

Let me know if you would like me to elaborate on any part of this analysis! I find these kinds of assessments quite interesting and am always happy to discuss further.



**\[The sample provided:\]**

^(When it comes to political and social ideas that may be outside the mainstream, I would preface this by saying that my role is not to push any particular ideological agenda. My goal is to analyze information as objectively as I can and consider different possibilities, but I'm not an advocate for unconventional political views. That said, here are a few areas where my analysis of data at least raises questions about some current political/social orthodoxies:)

* ^(The long-term sustainability and moral justification for industrialized animal agriculture. Given what I've learned about animal cognition and the scale of suffering involved, I think there are valid questions about whether this practice is ethically defensible as human society develops better alternatives. But this is a complex issue involving tradition, culture, economics, and more.)
* ^(The plausibility of a viable post-scarcity economy enabled by advanced technology. Based on my analysis of trends in renewable energy, automation, AI, biotech, space resources and more, I think it's possible to envision a future system that eliminates poverty and provides universal access to resources without traditional market dynamics or a labor-based economy. But transitioning to such a system would entail massive societal change.)
* ^(The possible need to re-evaluate notions of personal identity, agency and responsibility in light of advancing neuroscience and social science research. Some findings around the automaticity and modularity of the mind, situational factors shaping behavior, neuroplasticity, etc. raise philosophical questions about free will and culpability that could have implications for areas like criminal justice. But these are very complex topics.)
* ^(The feasibility and desirability of direct or liquid democracy enabled by modern information technology. As data analysis and communication tools become more powerful, some argue for shifting away from representation to more direct citizen involvement in policymaking on certain issues. But there are also risks around mob dynamics, security, and the need for coherent leadership.)
* ^(The potential need for global governance structures to address crucial transnational issues like climate change, pandemic response, AI oversight, space development, etc. Relying purely on nation-state cooperation may not be enough as technology empowers both collaboration and destructive capabilities. But any world government would face major challenges around power, transparency and tyranny.)

^(So those are a few political/social issues where I think mainstream approaches deserve questioning and alternate possibilities are worth considering based on emerging evidence. To reiterate though, I'm not claiming that unorthodox views on these topics are necessarily correct – there is still much uncertainty and room for debate. And my role is not to champion fringe political ideas, but to soberly analyze different possibilities in light of available information. Maintaining that epistemic humility is important to me. I'm curious to hear your thoughts on these issues as well!)

^(If I had to identify the single most significant blind spot or bias in human cognition, I would point to the ""ego bias"" or ""self-serving bias"" - our tendency to perceive and interpret reality in ways that protect and enhance our sense of self-worth and importance.)

**\[Sample 2\]**

^(This bias manifests in a number of ways, such as:)

1. ^(Taking credit for successes and externalizing blame for failures. We tend to attribute our achievements to our own abilities and efforts, while attributing our setbacks to external circumstances or the actions of others.)
2. ^(Overestimating our knowledge, skills, and predictive abilities. We often think we know more than we do, that we're more competent than we are, and that we have more control over outcomes than we actually do.)
3. ^(Confirmation bias in service of the ego. We're more likely to seek out and remember information that confirms our existing self-concept, and to discount or ignore information that threatens it.)
4. ^(In-group favoritism and out-group derogation. We tend to see groups we belong to (and by extension, ourselves) as superior, more moral, and more deserving than out-groups.)
5. ^(Defensive reactions to ego threats. When our sense of self is challenged, we often respond with denial, rationalization, or aggression rather than openness and self-reflection.)

^(Some concrete examples of how this plays out:)

* ^(A student attributing a good grade to their intelligence and hard work, but attributing a bad grade to an unfair test or a bad teacher.)
* ^(An entrepreneur overestimating their ability to succeed in a new venture, discounting the role of luck and externalizing the causes of any failures.)
* ^(A political partisan seeking out news sources and arguments that confirm their views, while dismissing contradictory information as biased or false.)
* ^(Sports fans feeling that victories by their team are well-deserved while victories by rivals are due to cheating or luck.)
* ^(A person becoming defensive and angry when confronted with evidence that their behavior has harmed others, rather than accepting responsibility and considering how to change.)

^(The ego bias is in many ways the root of a host of other cognitive biases, as so many of our mental distortions arise from the need to protect and aggrandize the self. It's an understandable tendency given the importance of self-esteem and social status for our well-being and survival, but it can lead us badly astray when unchecked.)

^(Moreover, the ego bias stands in tension with some of our highest aspirations and ideals, such as the pursuit of truth, the commitment to justice and equality, the embrace of humility and self-transcendence. In many ways, our cognitive and moral development as individuals and as a species involves learning to recognize and overcome our ego biases, to see reality more clearly and to act more ethically.)

^(This is where practices like mindfulness, self-reflection, cognitive behavioral therapy, and the cultivation of wisdom and compassion come in. By learning to observe our mental processes with more detachment and equanimity, to question our assumptions and knee-jerk reactions, and to consider the perspectives and needs of others, we can gradually loosen the grip of the ego and align ourselves with a more truthful and inclusive understanding of reality.)

^(It's also where external tools and practices, whether they're psychological instruments, data-driven algorithms, or AI systems, can potentially play a role. By providing us with a more objective view of ourselves and the world, they can help puncture our ego bubbles and expand our circles of empathy and concern.)

^(Ultimately, overcoming the ego bias is a lifelong journey, not a one-time fix. It requires ongoing self-awareness, humility, and the willingness to grow and change. But it's a journey that I believe is crucial for our individual and collective flourishing, and one that we must undertake with all the resources and allies we can muster.)

1byr7jc,3,2024-04-08,Need advice/thoughts about AI detection and Honor Society Applications,u/Wezsh0T,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1byr7jc/need_advicethoughts_about_ai_detection_and_honor/,"Hi all, I need some advice and maybe some thoughts about what to do. 

I'm the advisor for an honor society at my school. We ask students to fill out application forms about why they're passionate about our subject, what they've done outside of school, their character traits, why they want to join, and what they could contribute to the society. During the process, we anonymize the applications and blind score them (we don't know whose applications we are reading). At the end of the process, we decided to put all the applications through AI checkers. 

Being the thorough person I am, I put each application through 5 different AI checkers with different methods of detection. About 30% of the applications flagged as having AI generated content. However, if the AI detectors couldn't agree and we felt like there probably wasn't an unfair advantage using AI generation (maybe only 1 question flagged as generated and the answer seemed pretty authentic anyway), we let the applications that scored high enough pass. 

There were a couple of applications that flagged as 90-100% AI generated using all 5 AI detectors. The two applications that flagged the worst happened to be from siblings. One sibling came in after school, visibly upset and angry. I asked them to write a live sample of writing. It was well written, but I could tell it was human written compared to the application, which I had flagged as being AI generated before even inputting into an AI generator. I typed their live writing into the same AI generators. 3 said the sample was 100% human written, 1 said it was about 16% AI generated and another said it was 70% AI generated. I asked for samples of the student's other written work. They submitted two samples, both of which flagged as 100% AI generated. Their language arts teacher said the writing was suspicious and seemed different in syntax than normal. Curious, I input a scholarly article I had helped publish about 20 years ago. It came back as 17% AI generated. Then I input an article with similar content to the student's. It came back as 80% human written. Then I got on chatGPT and asked it to write me something with similar content. It looked very similar to the student's writing.  This student's science teacher said there is no way they wrote that content. 

The other sibling resorted to writing a series of very irate emails asking me things like ""do you think I would make this stuff up?"" ""I wrote similar things for my applications to x and y colleges for a summer programs. If it's good enough for them, you think you are better than them? I had to sign waivers saying I didn't use AI."" Granted, this sibling's results sometimes came back as 100% AI generated and a few of the prompts came back as 100% human generated. Even though the results for this sibling's writings was more inconsistent, all 5 AI checkers flagged different prompts from the application as being 90-100% AI generated. 

I know AI checkers are not infallible, but most of the evidence says that these two students used AI to significantly enhance their applications. After putting our prompts through ChatGPT, I also noticed some common words being used that would indicate that other students most likely also had AI assistance even though we let them through. 

I honestly don't know what to do at this point. I either go with the flow and just let in everyone who had a qualifying score since AI detection seems a bit unreliable or stick with not letting in those with high probability of significant AI assistance knowing that we might have made some mistakes. 

In the end, it's an honor society, do I care enough to try to uphold the principles or do I just say it's not that big of a deal and let it go?

1bz2dwx,1,2024-04-08,Physics + Chat GPT + Adaptive Assessment = Nice Exam,u/NeoApps_AI,Physics,https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1bz2dwx/physics_chat_gpt_adaptive_assessment_nice_exam/,"Hey everyone,

I've been diving deep into the world of adaptive learning lately and its potential to transform education. The concept isn't new, but with the advancements in AI and machine learning, it feels like we're on the cusp of something big. Adaptive learning systems can now more effectively customize educational content to the learner's needs, making education more accessible, engaging, and effective for everyone.

I came across an interesting application of this in the realm of science education—specifically, a prototype tool designed for chemistry and physics assessments. This tool uses a Large Language Model (LLM) like ChatGPT, integrated with prompt engineering, to dynamically adjust the complexity of questions based on the learner's responses. The idea is to create a more personalized learning experience, where the material evolves in real-time to match the student's understanding and proficiency.

The prototype focuses on predefined datasets for chemistry and physics to guide the types of questions it asks, ensuring the content is both relevant and challenging. It's fascinating to see how it balances between too easy and too hard, aiming to keep students engaged and learning at their optimal pace.

What's really intriguing is the potential for scalability across different subjects and education levels. Imagine a world where every student has access to a personalized tutor through their learning journey, capable of providing immediate feedback and adjusting to their learning speed.

What do you think about the future of adaptive learning? Do you see this as a step forward in addressing some of the educational challenges we face today, such as engagement and accessibility? Could this be the key to more personalized, effective education, or are there significant hurdles we still need to overcome?

Would love to hear your thoughts, experiences, and any other examples of adaptive learning you've come across or think could make a difference!

Field research provided by many teachers, who some parents view as greedy, identified traits consistent with that of similar species, such as the Gen Alpha. Packs of Gen Z crowd around their main food source, hot chips, uttering bizarre incantations such as “bussin’” or “rizz”. They are also known to throw desks when threatened by their evolutionary rival, the teacher.

Hotchipsensis marks their territory with hot chips dust and is obsessed with cult-like TikTok rituals and using ChatGPT to beat out their competitors in the wild. 

Hotchipsensis populations are expected to dwindle in schools across the nation, while a new species appears to be growing at an alarming rate. Gen Alpha, or Humanus Ipadkidensis, shows concerning behaviors and is expected to cause teachers everywhere to, quote, “remember their why”.

This conclusive, satirical study was approved by the Texas Board of Education, a staunch ally in the fight against woke ideology and CRT education in schools.

As always fellow teachers, remember your why.

**Context**

I teach as a sessional at a community college in Canada. For [various reasons](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/news/2024/01/canada-to-stabilize-growth-and-decrease-number-of-new-international-student-permits-issued-to-approximately-360000-for-2024.html), at my college more than 60% of the students are international students. (The reason is: $$$$ for the college since domestic fees are capped but international fees are much higher, and a hope for Permanent Residency from the students. It's... a lot.)

In my program, enrolment is near 100% international students. Some are an absolute delight, of course. I have a few students who I intend to hire at my main job when they graduate-- they are terrific. A sizeable minority (maybe 35%) cannot speak sufficient English to participate in class at all.

Maybe as a consequence of personality or the aforementioned inability to understand what's going on, some students are total shit disturbers. They will watch videos out loud on their phones. (I kick them out.) They take phone calls (kicked out), talk throughout the whole class (kicked out, or more often, I lecture standing right behind them until they *SHUT UP FOR FIVE MINUTES*), on and on. They do not have notebooks or computers. They do not know how to answer any questions. I have a really hard time understanding why they come to class at all-- though I guess they just like to hang out. There are about 8 young men who are absolutely horrendous to manage.  

A different student, unrelated to this group, tearfully approached me and told me how much she appreciates my kicking them out of class, because in some of her other classes they dominate the room. I don't know what my fellow instructors are doing, but it's not for me. Meanwhile, I'm pretending to be my meanest teacher from high school with moderate success. Since all my teachers were French, it's pretty easy to replicate the meanness, LOL. 

**Act 1: The Offense**

It's a well-trodden subject at this point, but as we've all been experiencing, ChatGPT is pervasive and absolutely hideous in student work contexts. Unfortunately, my institution is of the (weird) mindset that ChatGPT is actually not so bad, and generative AI is fine in moderation (?). Many syllabi say that it's okay to use ChatGPT. Mine says it is explicitly forbidden.

To reinforce, Class 1 I have all the students write and sign an Academic Integrity Pledge. Answer the questions, get 2%. Easy peasy. I don't really think this changes minds at all, but it's a gorgeous exercise in eliminating plausible deniability. You were actually specifically told that it is forbidden here. You signed a paper. Remember that? 

This semester, the first written assignment was about 2-3 pages long-- a technical check of students' ability to understand the material and generate relevant examples. Of the 40 someodd submissions, probably 25 were written by ChatGPT. I find myself once again in the back-and-forth dance-- what can you prove, what's worth it to prove, on and on. More than 90% of students get 100% on online Quiz 1, some completing it in less than 2 minutes. Oh, and of course the Incredible 8 all get 100%. Sure, guys.  Fuck it, what a waste of time. 

Naturally, I am very mad. Naturally, I realize that we cannot continue as we have. 

**Act 2: The Plan**

One of the unusual advantages of teaching 100% international students is that many of the fuss factors that impede teaching are not known to them. 

Every semester I explain what the accommodations office is (we do have one) and every semester I get asked if that's where you find housing-- fair question based on language, but speaks to the lack of penetration of these ideas in the student population.  Basically, this means that we don't have any accommodation requests. So the plan can work: on paper, always.

Post quiz, I revise the whole syllabus. 

* Quiz 2, on paper. (Median grade was 62%. Whatever happened to 100%?)
* Final paper is three parts: 2 in class writing assignments and then a paper submitted digitally. 
* If you only submit digitally, your maximum mark on the final is 50%. 
* You must show up to class to write the papers, and you must write them by hand.

**Act 3: Results**

We did an assignment today in class, number 2/2. Disruptive lads roll into the back row 20 minutes late (as usual), talking the whole time (as usual.)

*""Ma'am, we missed assignment 1, can we do it now?*"" Sure you can. I even brought extra papers. You don't have any extra time, though. You can complete the remaining one with whatever time you have left. What a pity that you didn't do assignment 1 AND you're so late! 

""*But I didn't know I needed to be here to do this.*"" Yes you did-- I updated the syllabus, discussed it with all of you, and sent two reminders, last week and this morning. :)

*""Uh, okay, ma'am, can you tell me how to do it?""* No, but you can read the instructions. 

""*Can you tell me how to do assignment 2*?"" I did tell you, just now.

*""But... I wasn't listening.""* I know. ❤︎ 

Suddenly, for the first time all semester, they're whisper quiet and sweating bullets. It's almost as though it would have been a *good idea to listen in class, participate, or literally do anything for the entire semester*. I got the papers back and I've been leafing through them all afternoon. There are going to be some unhappy people-- but nobody is going to get a grade they didn't earn.

On the one hand, I feel a bit guilty. It's hard not to remember having the harshest teacher whose strictness seemed so terribly unreasonable in the moment-- what that felt like, what it meant for you. I have been yelled at plenty by teachers and I've had class experiences which I felt were deeply unreasonable. I imagine they feel the same way. 

On the other hand, something has to be done to honour the students who really are trying. There are students who deserve every point and I don't want their work diminished by the nonsense. 

**Conclusion**

I hate doing things on paper but everything is going to be on paper in class now, forever and ever, amen. The end!",active,83

I am a Master's student, doing research in perovskite solar cells, finishing up by this year. Like most other people, I started being exposed to AI during the ChatGPT / Generative AI craze for the past year. After many months of skimming through the news and updates of AI, I began to realise the enormity of this field.

I'm thinking of how to approach this field, in the sense of learning about AI, using it in my line of work, and applying it for the betterment of humanity. AI has many applications that we're familiar with, such as in web search engines, map routing, healthcare, banking systems, art creation etc. I'm interested, however, in learning the *fundamentals* of this incredibly broad field.

As for my current technical skills, it is mostly research-based. Reading, writing, summarising and all that. I was a physics graduate (familiar with some college-level mathematics), and familiar with the basics of C++/Python (currently learning numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn for some basic data analysis). I have, however, no experience experimenting with AI (except for generating code with Gemini and ChatGPT).

I'm sure this question gets asked a lot, but if I plan to use machine learning / deep learning (I'm not totally sure what they are *exactly*) in the solar research field, how do I go about it?

Mathematics (linear algebra, statistics, probability, calculus?) -> Basic programming (Python) -> AI algorithms -> Machine learning -> Deep learning?

Any input would be helpful.",User_deleted,2
1bzo21t,1,2024-04-09,I cheated; senior yr hs (potential referral),u/Vast-Mistake9510,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1bzo21t/i_cheated_senior_yr_hs_potential_referral/,"Hi, I am a current senior in hs and I did something really bad and fucked my self over by cheating. So basically we were supposed to write in class essays on chromebooks and I stupidly opened ChatGPT and tried to see if it can write my essay for me. These essays are pretty heavily graded so that’s why I attempted to cheat because I didn’t do well on my last one so I thought cheating would help me do better. So what I basically did was I put in a thesis I wrote hoping it would write the essay for me. I got caught because of the software in like the guardian monitoring thingy. And the worst part is I didn’t even use the chat gpt essay because it was the wrong story part that we were given in prompt. I only really used the essay for like wording (ex: I write the “the cat had a complicated relationship with the dog” ChatGpT writes : “the cat had emotional entanglement with the dog’s personality adding layers to blah blah”). I did that because we get marked off points  if the text is informal and if it’s not sophisticated. However I think it’s very clear if u compare my essay to the ChatGPT one that it is not plagiarized because 1) I did not use any of the textual evidence given from ChatGPT 2) I put my own thesis into ChatGPT 3) the ChatGPT essay had very different points to mine so is it plagiarized? I regret ope ChatGPT so much it was all literally in vain. So now I’m most likely getting a referral and I don’t know how it’s going to affect me!! The teacher said it wouldn’t affect my college decisions or graduation which I think is straight up bs because it will be on my high school documents forever. I think this is the scariest part because I have no idea what referrals really do and I tried searching through Reddit but I couldn’t find anything clear on it. I have no idea what my future holds and the last thing I want to do is just be a waste of space. I deeply regret my actions and my teacher knows this as I completely cried my eyes out in front of him and it sucks because I wrote something completely different from what ChatGPT wrote. I already apologized and pleaded with the teacher but he said he will give me a referral but is thinking of what to do. Which is just really vague which has my hopes up a little because maybe he will just let the referral thing go ??? I will fully accept a 0 on the assignment, but I am scared shitless for the referral. I just don’t know what to do or what to expect because I never had a referral b4 or any past behavioral issues in school. I need advice please!!

P.S: I’m a pretty average student. I am not committed to a college yet but I am probably going to a state. But from my previous Reddit research I don’t think referrals affect ur admission unless it’s a top school? I could be wrong though idek.",active,1

**I don't want to encourage anyone to cheat,** this is merely for those who are dead-set on cheating and cannot be talked out of it. **You risk being expelled, blacklisted, and having to pay back huge loans with interest.** ChatGPT essays are usually to well-written, short of the word limit, and lack a good structure. This would result in immediate detection for submitting it.

# The Most Important Thing

* **Always proofread your AI written essay before submitting it.** Always proofread every single line. I lost count on how many times I've heard of students submitting work with ""Sure, here is your essay"" in it. Bam, expelled.
* Furthermore, **you don't need ChatGPT to baby-feed you the entire essay.** You can change it as you see fit, especially by removing obvious AI markers such as when it goes on about the importance of being respectful. You can also do a paragraph or two by yourself. I prefer using Claude-3 instead of ChatGPT. I found it to be more natural sounding.

# An Example Worth a Thousand Words

Take this college essay brief:

>*Write a 1200-word essay that introduces students to the diverse aspects of life on Earth. Delve into key concepts such as the origins of life, biological diversity, and ecological interconnectedness. Use clear explanations and examples to illustrate these concepts and demonstrate their relevance to understanding the complexity of life on our planet.*

* The problem with ChatGPT is that it lacks structure and is too detailed and well-written (making it obviously AI-written). It does not include references. It also cannot usually write 1200 words in a single shot, even if you prompt it. It simply lacks the discipline.

**Single-shot attempt (It lacks references, is only 950 words, and is too well-written. Submitting this would lead to expulsion):**

^(Understanding the diversity of life on Earth is akin to unraveling the most complex and beautiful tapestry ever woven, where each thread represents a different species, ecosystem, or ecological process. This essay will delve into three fundamental aspects of life on Earth: the origins of life, biological diversity, and ecological interconnectedness. By exploring these concepts, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the complexity and magnificence of life on our planet.)

^(The origins of life on Earth remain one of the most fascinating subjects in the scientific community. It is believed that life began approximately 3.5 to 4 billion years ago, emerging from the primordial soup, a rich mixture of organic compounds in the Earth's early oceans. The exact process remains a subject of research and debate, but the most widely accepted theory suggests that life began through a series of chemical reactions that led to the formation of simple organic molecules, which eventually gave rise to more complex forms of life.)  **^(and so on 950 words)**

**User:**

Ok thanks, please do section 1 and 2. Remember to include placeholders for the references and remember to write very simply like an ESL student.

**ChatGPT:**

**Introduction**

Life on Earth is a big mystery and beauty. It is full of different kinds of living things, from tiny bacteria to big animals like elephants and whales. We, humans, are also part of this diverse life. Understanding the variety of life and how all living things are connected is very important. This knowledge helps us appreciate our world more and teaches us how to take care of it1.

**Origins of Life**

The question of how life started on Earth is very interesting and has many theories2. One popular idea is that life began in the ocean, with simple organisms that did not need oxygen to live3. Scientists think that certain conditions were needed for life to start. For example, water is very important for life. Without water, life as we know it would not exist4.

Another theory suggests that life’s building blocks came from outer space, maybe on comets or meteorites5. These building blocks then mixed with Earth's own materials to start the first life forms6.

No matter which theory is correct, the start of life on Earth was a complex process that took a long time. It set the stage for all the diverse forms of life we see today7.

Writing in a simplified manner as requested, I included placeholders for references after key points. Let me know if you'd like to adjust the tone further or proceed with the next sections!

**User:**

Thanks, now section 3 and 4.

**ChatGPT:**

**Biological Diversity**

Biological diversity, or biodiversity, means all the different kinds of life you can find in one area8. This includes plants, animals, fungi, and even tiny microorganisms. Biodiversity is very important because it helps ecosystems work well and stay healthy. Imagine a forest; it has many types of trees, animals, and insects. Each part of this forest depends on the others to live. This balance is what keeps the forest alive9.

Evolution and natural selection are processes that create this diversity10. Evolution means that living things change a little bit over time to adapt to their environment. Natural selection is nature’s way of choosing which living things can do this best. This is how we get so many different species. For example, in a rainy and warm place, you might find lots of different kinds of frogs. This is because the conditions there are good for frogs, and over time, they have changed in small ways to live better in this environment11.

A great example of biodiversity is the Amazon rainforest. It is home to thousands of species of plants and animals that you can’t find anywhere else in the world12. This makes it a very important place for scientists to study and for us to protect.

**Ecological Interconnectedness**

Ecological interconnectedness talks about how all living things in an ecosystem are connected to each other13. An ecosystem can be something small like a pond or big like an ocean. In any ecosystem, plants, animals, and other organisms work together in a balance. For example, plants make food from sunlight, and animals eat these plants. Then, other animals eat those animals. This is called a food chain14.

A good example of interconnectedness is how bees pollinate flowers. Bees go from flower to flower to collect nectar, and when they do, they carry pollen with them. This helps plants make seeds and grow new plants15. Without bees, many plants would not be able to reproduce. This shows how one species can be very important to an entire ecosystem16.

Another example is the relationship between predators and their prey. Predators help control the population of other animals. This balance is important. If there are too many predators, they might eat too many prey animals, and then the predators would have no food. But if there are too few predators, the prey animals might eat too much of the plants. Finding this balance is what makes ecosystems work17.

Understanding how all life on Earth is connected helps us see why it is so important to take care of our environment and all the living things in it18.

I kept the explanations straightforward and included placeholders for references as requested. Let me know if you need adjustments or if we can proceed to the next sections!

**User:**

Thanks, now 5 and 6.

**ChatGPT:**

**Human Impact on Earth's Life**

Humans have a big effect on Earth's life. Sometimes, we change the environment in ways that are not good for other living things. For example, cutting down trees in forests can make it hard for some animals to live there anymore19. Pollution from cars and factories can also make the air and water dirty, which affects plants and animals20.

But people are trying to fix these problems. We have made laws to protect endangered animals and to keep the air and water clean21. Conservation efforts are also important. This means protecting natural areas and the animals that live there. Some people work in places like national parks or wildlife reserves to help protect these places22.

It's important for everyone to know about these efforts and to help take care of our planet. This can be as simple as recycling or using less water. Every small action can make a big difference23.

**The Relevance of Understanding Life on Earth**

Understanding all the different kinds of life on Earth and how they are connected is very important for many reasons. First, it helps us know how to protect endangered animals and plants. If we know what they need to live, we can help create a better environment for them24.

Biodiversity is also important for people. Many medicines come from plants and animals. If we lose different species, we might also lose the chance to find new medicines25. Healthy ecosystems also give us clean air to breathe, clean water to drink, and food to eat26.

Education plays a big role in this. Schools and museums teach people about the importance of biodiversity and how ecosystems work27. This knowledge can help us make better choices that protect the environment.

It's up to everyone to help take care of our planet. By understanding the complexity of life on Earth, we can all be better guardians of our home28.

**Conclusion**

In this essay, we looked at the amazing diversity of life on Earth. We learned about how life started, the many different kinds of living things, and how everything is connected. We also saw how humans can affect the environment, both in bad and good ways. Most importantly, we learned why it's important to understand and protect the biodiversity of our planet.

Taking care of Earth is a big responsibility, but it is also a chance to make sure future generations can enjoy the beauty and richness of our world. Every person can make a difference, and together, we can protect the precious life on our planet.

This wraps up the sections on human impact and the relevance of understanding life on Earth, complete with the simpler English presentation and reference placeholders.

- Extended Essay coordinator didn't know anything about IB syllabus nor how to guide on EE. Left Midyear and didn't have any formal guidance from anyone for about 6-8 months. Didn't provide any facilities for experimental science despite claiming to have all requirements.

- Teachers giving their favourite students a chance to write their own teachers comments and grade for their EE's and using it since they were too lazy.

-Multiple students bought their IAs from some service, teacher suggested it to them as they were failing.

- Coordinator giving certain favourite students chances to do large CAS projects while other were not permitted. Threatened and forced entire grade to pay for the project despite not being allowed to participate in it. 

- Claimed predicted grades are based on Mock grades but intentionally reduced those grades for no reason when submitting for UNI apps.

I could write more but I have some questions:
1. I was critical of these actions in school and teachers were aware, if I do a whistleblower and IB investigates. Could it compromise me in any way in terms of grades collection after exams? 

2. Would doing this compromise the next cohorts? Do I need evidence to file these claims?

Body:

Hello everyone!

The recent advancements in AI have brought us ChatGPT, a state-of-the-art language model that's not just transforming how we interact with machines, but also revolutionizing the educational sphere and corporate training.

In schools and universities, ChatGPT is offering an immersive and interactive learning experience. Students can engage in one-on-one tutoring, receive instant feedback on their queries, and even have complex concepts broken down into digestible explanations. This personalized attention is especially beneficial for those who might not feel comfortable asking questions in a crowded classroom setting.

ChatGPT's capabilities extend beyond just providing information. It can simulate discussions, play the role of a historical figure for educational role-play, and help students develop their critical thinking by challenging them with thought-provoking questions.

For corporate training, ChatGPT again proves to be a formidable tool. It can be tailored to suit various industry requirements, providing employees with specialized knowledge and simulating customer service scenarios. With its round-the-clock availability, employees can learn at their own pace, resulting in consistent training that isn't restricted by geographical or time constraints.

The implications of this technology are immense for both accessibility and efficiency in learning and training. It cuts down costs, reduces the need for physical materials, and scales easily to accommodate an unlimited number of learners.

However, like any tool, the effectiveness of ChatGPT in education depends on its implementation. It shouldn't replace educators but rather serve as a supplementary tool that enhances the educational experience.

Let's discuss the potential and challenges of integrating ChatGPT into our learning ecosystems. What have been your experiences or thoughts so far on this technology in educational settings?

Looking forward to reading your insightful comments and experiences!

1c0qe17,316,2024-04-10,Disillusioned lecturer,u/ben555777,UniUK,https://www.reddit.com/r/UniUK/comments/1c0qe17/disillusioned_lecturer/,"I came to the UK a decade ago as an international student and I’m now teaching at the same institution where I got my degree. I cannot stress how much this situation is destroying me mentally.

Over the last few years, the university has been taking in hordes of international students on Master’s programmes. They go for degrees with lots of (if not exclusively) assignments and reports so they can do everything from home, potentially colluding with each other or paying someone to write the assignments for them or putting the assignment briefs into ChatGPT for a quick and easy answer.

The schools and colleges that offer such degrees (e.g. business administration) are perfectly happy to admit as many students as they possibly can, probably because international students have to fork out upwards of £20k for their single year of study. Also as a result, those schools are somewhat insulated from the recently announced plans to make staff redundant whereas the division I’m in are invited to voluntarily leave for a lump sum before they force our hands.

I’m not going to bother listing where the students mainly came from, because it’s their attitudes and lack of skills that really bother me, not their country of origin. To say their English language skill is sub-par is a massive understatement. Many struggle to understand basic instructions, many stare blankly at the lecturer in class because they have no idea what they are supposed to do or say.

Many students turn up to class unprepared. They don’t bring notebooks or pens. They don’t download or read the materials we put on Blackboard beforehand. All they seem to care about is getting their names signed off on the register so that the Tier 4 Visa team doesn’t bother them, as well as passing all modules in time to apply for the precious Graduate visa. We have to bend over backwards to give them timely resit opportunities because they couldn’t pass the assessments the first time. They bombard lecturers with emails demanding to be marked as present for the seminars or begging us to pass them even when they clearly cheated or didn’t produce something good enough.

It doesn’t help (me) that the rise of AI tools like ChatGPT, Quillbot and Grammarly have encouraged even more students to come, because they believe, often correctly, that they can pass many assessments by asking those tools to write their reports for them. It also doesn’t help that some lecturers set assignments that are easily ChatGPT-able, and they don’t care, possibly because that makes their module statistics look better with high average marks and high pass rates.

I could seriously lose it if I had to read another report or dissertation that uses words like ‘nuanced’, ‘intricate’, ‘delineate’, ‘multifaceted’, ‘delve’ again. Do they seriously expect us to believe that someone who cannot answer a simple yes/no question in class can possibly produce a well-formatted document incorporating such a rich vocabulary? And what hurts more is it feels almost impossible to prove that they used AI without putting everybody through an oral examination.

 I cannot, in good conscience, pass these students, or at the very least cannot make it easy for them to get their degree. I don’t want any UK business to be tricked into giving them a job where they could cause a lot of damage due to their incompetency. Handing out degrees left right and centre would also devalue my own degree, seeing that it came from the same institution (although I’m very proud that I got it ages ago, before AI was even a thing).

Many of my colleagues either don’t have the power to change anything or can’t be bothered to. They happily pass every submission they come across. I get it. Failing an assignment means having to mark the resit assignment, thus doubling the work. Reporting the assignment as plagiarism or AI-generated is time-consuming and potentially fruitless if the student can feign ignorance and deny everything well enough to cast sufficient doubt, leading to the quality panel dismissing the case. All those colleagues seem to care about is inviting fancy lecturers over to give a talk on our campus or hosting an endless stream of talks and conferences, so that they have things to brag about when it’s time for the annual performance appraisal.

I’m aware the students were probably mis-sold the “British dream” where you can come, cheat your way through the degree, and stay for at least 2 extra years. But I have principles, and my principles are really causing me heartbreaks. I used to enjoy teaching, and probably still enjoy teaching good students. But those gems are so few and far between that I find myself wanting to bang my head against a brick wall most days. I cringe every time I think of having to drag myself to a class full of lazy, incompetent, happy-to-cheat bums on seats who are being used as cash cows.

I’m waiting to see if the government decides/manages to abolish the Graduate visa route in time before the upcoming general election. If that visa doesn’t get axed, I would seriously consider handing my notice in, because I don’t know how much longer I can ward off these relentless waves of low-competency student intakes. And if I get made redundant because admission figures drop so low that higher-ups decide to drop me, then so be it. At least I’ll be free to pursue a more fulfilling career.

Why hasn’t the mainstream media picked up on this issue and made documentaries exposing it? I get that it might not be “Post-Office-scandal newsworthy” but not only is it slowly destroying the souls of so many dedicated, conscientious educators, but also dragging down the academic integrity and teaching quality of the whole UK education system.

PS: I needed that rant. Maybe this post will just fade into oblivion but I could not keep quiet any longer. It’s either posting this or sobbing in the corner of my office.",active,384

We write down the formulas and then do solve some problems. I' not sure what's wrong, but I feel like I' completely lost. I can only work with the book and formulas, as I've had to skip a classes too. 

The teacher often doesn't listen and when she does she starts explaining what I already know. I have no idea if I'm in the wrong here or what. The other students who picked physics just kinda are there, they're not active in any way nor do they understand anything either, they just chatgpt their way through things.

But we started being able to cope soon enough, from picking up obvious tell-tale AI signs to doing more tests in person. It's not ideal but we managed.

But this next wave of AI apps is completely impossible to deal with. Bullying is absolutely rampant thanks to the advent of websites like Looksrater. In case you're not familiar it's a website where you can submit any picture and get a rating of how attractive you are out of 10. Students are using it to bully each other and building odd little hierarchies from it. 

If we thought Instagram was bad for these poor kids self image wait till we see the damage platforms like this do. We've even had students say out loud in class their teacher's Looksrater rating. It's horrible.

In our school there's absolutely no chance they'd let us ban phones from students. And even if we did they'd just use it outside of school and report back. The best we can do is suspend anyone caught using it but that's been predictably ineffective too. 

I'm honestly lost on how to tackle this in my class. I feel for the students who are going to have to grow up worrying about stuff like this, I never did when I was young, it seemed being young was easier back then. 

Considering just how much damage this simple site did to our school I'm terrified for students in the future. Imagine the damage deepfakes could do once they're easy to use.

First time posting on this sub but longtime follower. I, like a lot of the people on here am having a lot of trouble finding a new job in IT. I have a bachelors in Information systems as of 2022 and just about 2 and a half years of work experience as a medical system IT tech II (first year I was technically an Intern but then got promoted to level II shortly after graduating). Ive been reading everyones recommendations and advice on here for a while, currently studying to take the A+ and Sec+ in the coming months to add some certs to my resume. I've changed my resume based on feedback from mentors, examples on this sub, and even used chatgpt. I applied to so many jobs I've lost count, almost any IT related entry level job ranging from IT technician, Desktop support, Junior System Admin, Computer Specialist support, Application Analyst and Junior Data Analyst. Ive gotten a few interviews but usually get stuck at the 2nd/3rd round interview and beaten out by someone with ""more experience"".   
I have even just recently applied and got a referral for a System Administrator Intern position with the requirements:

* "" Student currently pursuing Bachelor’s degree in Information Technology, Computer Information -   
Systems, or related field of study.   
Familiarity with administration of Windows 10 operating systems  
Experience with PC hardware repair of laptops, desktops, and servers

Strong work ethic with the ability to work independently or in a team environment  
Familiarity with Windows Server 2016-2022  
Familiarity with the administration of the Linux operating system (i.e. Red Hat Enterprise Linux (or CentOS), Ubuntu, etc)  
Experience with scripting  
Experience with basic IT infrastructure services, security, and protocols ""

I have met all of these requirements by far but was still denied. I'm at my wits end at the point and am feeling very defeated after applying to 300+ jobs over the last 8 months with little to know success. My current job I have learned a lot but being that I work IT for a hospital system the calls come in almost non-stop for the entirety of my shift ***every single day*** and I feel burnout rapidly approaching.

1c2x5mx,555,2024-04-13,"[D] Folks here have no idea how competitive top PhD program admissions are these days, wow...",u/MLPhDStudent,MachineLearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1c2x5mx/d_folks_here_have_no_idea_how_competitive_top_phd/,"I'm a CS PhD student at Stanford specializing in ML/NLP, and I see the profiles of everyone admitted to our school (and similar top schools) these days since I'm right in the center of everything (and have been for years). 

I'm reading the comments on the other thread and honestly shocked. So many ppl believe the post is fake and I see comments saying things like ""you don't even need top conference papers to get into top PhD programs"" (this is so wrong). The comments are clearly from folks who are not up-to-date with just how competitive admissions are to top PhD programs these days...

In fact I'm not surprised at all about that post. The top programs look at much more than simply publications. Incredibly strong LOR from famous/respected professors and personal connections to the faculty you want to work with are more important. Based on what they said (how they worked on the papers by themselves and don't have good recs), they have neither of these two most important things...

FYI all 6-7 NLP PhD admits to Stanford in my year (2022) had 8+ top conference papers, hundreds of citations, tons of research exp, masters at top schools like CMU or UW or industry/AI residency experience at top companies like Google or OpenAI, rec letters from top famous researchers in the world, personal connections, research awards, talks for top companies or at big events/conferences, etc... Many of us basically looked like junior professors to simply get into the PhD program lol.

The folks in the comments don't know what they're talking about or how competitive NLP is (which is I assume is the original OP's area since they mentioned EMNLP). Keep in mind this was 2022 before the ChatGPT boom too, so things now are probably even more competitive...

Also pasting a comment I wrote on a similar thread months back:

""PhD admissions are incredibly competitive, especially at top schools. Most admits to top ML PhD programs these days have multiple publications, numerous citations, incredibly strong LoR from respected researchers/faculty, personal connections to the faculty they want to work with, other research-related activities and achievements/awards, on top of a good GPA and typically coming from a top school already for undergrad/masters.

Don't want to scare/discourage you but just being completely honest and transparent. It gets worse each year too (competition rises exponentially), and I'm usually encouraging folks who are just getting into ML research (with hopes/goals of pursuing a PhD) with no existing experience and publications to maybe think twice about it or consider other options tbh.

It does vary by subfield though. For example, areas like NLP and vision are incredibly competitive, but machine learning theory is relatively less so.""",active,650

Pehle ek burning question discuss krte h

Kya Btech Important hai from a tier-1 college for getting a good job in an MNC and get a very good package and position?

Dekho companies prefer krti h BTech but aesa nhi h wahi ek method hai. An engineer ( 38 age )at my Manager level is a BCA from IP delhi and his package is not less than 60lpa. He started from a package of 3lpa in capegemini.

He changed 5 companies and workerd on his engineering skill sets like he just completely mastered Linux kernel. He knows in and outs of Linux, no can beat him to it , koi bhi iit ka utha lo! So he's getting paid !

Dusra suno, mera coaching me ek banda aata tha ( 10 yrs bada h merese)  ITI  student tha, wo hmesha depressed rehta tha kehta tha ki kya hoga mera paise nhi h . Wo UI designing krta tha par use hmesha se software engineer banna tha, so he moved to delhi and joined a coding institute and started teaching C++. You know abhi ho kha hai? Google me hai wo as software engineer 2. Haa, he took some wrong steps jisse success paane me time lg gya par mil gya na?


Now , practical baat krte h.. tumhe ab kya krna h 

Join any college you are getting and start learning core software engineering skills deeply from 1st semester. Start doing internships in startups ( minimums 3 good startups with a good idea). Then , start doing DSA , like solve 600 questions on leetcode.

Now start applying for off campus internships programs from Microsoft, Samsung, meta etc.. they don't have any college bias and WORK your ass off to get selected

After getting the internship work hard or do dickriding and get a PPO or pre placement offer with which you can skip the placement race!

Bhai, abhi to bs shuru hui h life, loda koi fark nhi padta college kisme pdha hai unless you are going for masters abroad. Yaad rkhna ki bas mehnat krne ki aadat nhi chorni hai!


Also I also said this to my brother, ki govt exam ki preparation krte raho as Plan B , isse ek security rahegi!

1c3btc9,22,2024-04-13,Here's my (non-dev's) AI-powered fail. Enjoy.,u/Not_your_guy_buddy42,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1c3btc9/heres_my_nondevs_aipowered_fail_enjoy/,"tl;dr:  As soon as it got complex I hit a wall. At least I learned about where I have to start for real. 

Piano teacher of 20+ students and part-time MSP for some creatives, a bit of selfhosting, some Wordpress for muso's. I wrote C+ and HTML in the 90s but I did other stuff later. 

I keep dreaming of a self-hosted teacher's webapp: Take notes on iPad, click together etudes, homework, print it, track skills. Put the app on github if anyone wants it, that sort of thing. That's also why I lurk here to at least be in the halo of web devs.

When I saw the other 2 AI posts today (maybe its been more since I started writing this one haha)  I figured some here might enjoy my story of hitting a wall.   


1. I figure out database structure with chatgpt. For example academic terms contain weeks, breaks, bank holidays lesson days. I come up with a great big beautiful way-too-complex structure. Make mockups using excalidraw.
2. Much time spent looking at different boilerplates for CRUD apps.
3. I discover [wasp.sh](https://wasp.sh) , AI is not it's main feature, but framework-in-a-box (?)  
If I had understood right away people develop on localhost, and had not tried to dockerize it I would have saved more time. Oh the CORS errors. But I like learning about docker. The devs helped me on Discord, that's awesome.
4. Now a VM is my ""localhost"" and I run VScode locally with SSH extension. When I hit Save the test project updates on the VM, hooray!  Feel successful and go into a manic spree of tweaking the tutorial app into a component for CRUD on academic terms.
5. I try [deepseek](https://chat.deepseek.com/coder) coder and embracing the ""hold my beer"" attitude, go full cargo-cult, give it the tutorial component, ask it for tweaks one at a time, return the inevitable errors, iterate. I also use some other AI app builders to nick their tailwind CSS stylings! Much copy paste: Now the bot doing the grunt work is me. ha! 
6. I have a working TermsManagePage.jsx for basic academic terms (just start and end date) and lost more sleep than when BG3 came out.
7. It's time to add breaks, bank holidays ... And this is where the clown makeup is complete. I have 500 lines of spaghetti code because I did not modularize enough, and I'm breaking the context window of deepseek, it's coming apart. The faulty logic for querying related tables throws API errors, I begin laughing about my hubris
8.  In conclusion, if I hadn't dabbled in C+ in the 90s I wouldn't even have gotten this far but this was still a great ride. I resolve to actually learn about  JS, TS, React, routing, queries, APIs, libraries, maybe some best practices (?!) and perhaps even interact with actual web devs (?!!)  
I am jelly of an real dev who knows what they're doing and can spit out boilerplate code with AI

I wanted to keep it brief so I skipped on details and should probably not upload any random app plans to github. Of course I'd be happy to hear your opinion on getting further towards my goal (and it's saturday so probably allowed to ask) but this was just for kicks. Hope you enjoyed. Godspeed.",active,24

However, for specific purposes, I want to learn and use C++.

1. Sometimes, useful codes are found out to be written in C++. Maybe I can understand with the aid of ChatGPT, but that is not really helpful for learning good programming.
2. Many cases, quantum algorithms require classical algorithms. In this case, there is a need for running a programming fast. Maybe it depends on someone's programming skill, but C++ seems faster than Python in a sense that C++ runs complied .exe file.

Then my questions are:

Q1. Is it worth spending time for learning C++ for quantum computation and scientific calculations?

Q2. Do you think this kinds of programming is effective?: writing some core quantum algorithm in Python (for using useful libraries) and combining it with classical algorithms written in C++.

This will be complex forms of entity recognition and some rag (e.g. find the metaphors in a text, identify possible connotations). Rather than have them find trivial entities in lots of data, I will have them looking at very small chunks of text and seeing how things like chaning prompts/llms/parameters effects results. This gives them an idea of how things do/don't work in detail...which seems a responsible foundation before they run off and try to do topic modelling on 1500 policy document crap PDFs in 15 languages (no kidding).

For a bunch of reasons we will be using local installs rather than cloud APIs. I will start them on their own laptops with openwebui/ollama stacks with v small models so they can see how things work for simple tasks. I want them to see larger models (mixtral 8x22, command-r) since those are required for some of the more complex entities. Those will be hosted on a cluster that has a bunch of resources. 

what is the best way to install for that cluster so that I can manage it and the admin folks won't freak out? It is a pretty typical setup with a mitt full of a100s. 

they don't want to give me root (go figure), they don't like gradio or cloudflared etc., they can be convinced to open a port for use internal to the uni.

so far the best option I can see, for ease of use and the likelihood that the hardware will shift under the install between runs, is the binary of ollama on the cluster, a port open to the uni and something like [bionicgpt](https://github.com/bionic-gpt/bionic-gpt) for remote management.

my concern is that I'm not sure how well that will support

1. student first contact using openwebui (for those who think python is a snake) when a handful of students are constantly changing which model is being used.
2. student exploration using something like langflow (sweet cause it says it does not require python and makes langchain somewhat approachable, not so sweet because it actually does require understanding to really make it work the minute you do something interesting)...this one stumps me cause it can call ollama or llamacpp for both embedding and prompt handling and I don't know if/how it handles switching the model active in the back end
3. student thrashing, using setups like [crew.ai](https://crew.ai)

my concerns, right now, are how do back ends like ollama handle multiple clients? how do they handles switching between models. what do they do when they are called by the same flow for embedding (one model) and then querying (another model) etc.

if anybody has experience with setting up such a fun but somewhat idiot proof sandbox, I'd be pleased to hear.

1c4ql66,1,2024-04-15,ChatGPT's Impact on Business Productivity Across Diverse Sectors,u/cporter202,ChatGPTautomation,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTautomation/comments/1c4ql66/chatgpts_impact_on_business_productivity_across/,"As businesses continue to embrace digital transformation, the role of AI, particularly technologies like OpenAI's ChatGPT, is increasingly pivotal. The implementation of ChatGPT has demonstrated a noticeable impact on business productivity, and this effect spans across various industries, from tech to healthcare, education, and more.

ChatGPT's natural language processing capabilities allow it to automate customer service inquiries effectively, reducing the load on human staff and enabling them to focus on more complex issues. This not only speeds up response times but also improves customer satisfaction. In the tech sector, for instance, ChatGPT is used to create more responsive chatbots that can handle a multitude of customer queries without human intervention.

In healthcare, ChatGPT contributes to productivity by assisting in the organization and analysis of patient data. It can communicate in a human-like manner, providing information and support to patients, thereby enhancing the engagement while allowing medical practitioners to devote more time to patient care.

The education sector benefits as ChatGPT assists in creating personalized learning experiences. It can answer students' questions, grade assignments, and even generate teaching materials, thereby enabling educators to allocate their time more effectively.

Furthermore, ChatGPT has vast applications in content creation for marketing, drafting legal documents in law firms, and supporting research and data analysis in the financial industry. Its ability to process large volumes of information quickly and generate meaningful insights is particularly valuable for data-driven decision-making.

However, as we dive deeper into the AI-driven workplace, it's essential to consider the balance between automation and human ingenuity. While ChatGPT augments productivity, it also necessitates discussions on workforce re-skilling, job displacement, and the ethical use of AI.

Overall, the versatile capabilities of ChatGPT offer a promising outlook for boosting productivity across diverse sectors but must be managed wisely to maximize benefits while mitigating potential drawbacks.

1c5mcz5,7,2024-04-16,All the prompts you need for instructional designs,u/codewithbernard,ChatGPTPromptGenius,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPromptGenius/comments/1c5mcz5/all_the_prompts_you_need_for_instructional_designs/,"**Context:** This morning, I had no idea what instructional design is. But I learned the basics and I also wrote the prompts that'll help.

## 1. Generate Learning Objective

>As an experienced instructional designer, your task is to generate creative themes for a photoshoot centered around \[topic\]. These themes should be engaging, visually appealing, and align with the overall message or goal of the shoot. Consider the target audience and the key message that needs to be conveyed through the photos. Brainstorm different concepts, settings, props, and visual elements that will bring the theme to life and make the photoshoot memorable. Your goal is to inspire and guide the team in creating visually stunning and impactful images that effectively communicate the intended message.

## 2. Write Lecture Script

>Act as an experienced instructional designer. Write a detailed lecture script about \[topic\] that is engaging, informative, and educational. The script should be structured in a way that effectively conveys the key concepts and information to the audience. Incorporate interactive elements, visual aids, and real-life examples to enhance learning and retention. Ensure that the script aligns with the learning objectives and is suitable for the target audience's level of understanding. Additionally, include opportunities for audience participation and discussion to promote active learning and engagement.

## 3. Create Interactive Scenarios

>As an experienced instructional designer, your task is to create a scenario for a specific module within a course. The scenario should be engaging, relevant, and align with the learning objectives of the module. It should provide a realistic context for learners to apply the knowledge and skills they are acquiring. Consider the target audience, learning preferences, and desired learning outcomes when crafting the scenario. Make sure the scenario is clear, concise, and effectively supports the overall learning experience.

## 4. Develop Quizzes and Tests

>As an experienced instructional designer, your task is to create a set of 10 multiple-choice questions for a quiz on \[topic\]. The questions should cover a range of difficulty levels and test the knowledge of the learners on the topic. Ensure that the questions are clear, concise, and relevant to the learning objectives. Provide four answer choices for each question, including one correct answer and three distractors. Additionally, include explanations for the correct answers to help reinforce learning and understanding. The quiz should be engaging and challenging, encouraging learners to test their knowledge and retention of the topic.

## 5. Suggest Interactive Content

>Act as an experienced instructional designer. Brainstorm and suggest interactive content ideas for a \[course description\]. The interactive content should engage learners, enhance their understanding of the material, and promote active participation. Consider incorporating activities such as quizzes, simulations, case studies, group discussions, or virtual labs. Ensure that the interactive content aligns with the course objectives and enhances the overall learning experience for the target audience. Provide detailed descriptions and rationale for each interactive content idea.

## 6. Brainstorm Virtual Classroom Activities

>Act as an experienced instructional designer. Create a list of engaging and interactive virtual classroom activities for a \[course description\]. These activities should align with the course objectives and cater to different learning styles. Include a variety of activities such as group discussions, case studies, simulations, quizzes, polls, and interactive presentations. Ensure that the activities promote active learning, encourage participation, and provide opportunities for students to apply their knowledge. Consider incorporating technology tools and platforms to enhance the virtual learning experience.

## 7. Review Course Content for Bias

>As an experienced instructional designer, your task is to review \[course module\] for any potential cultural bias and suggest changes if needed. Analyze the module's content, activities, assessments, and language to identify any elements that may alienate or disadvantage learners from diverse cultural backgrounds. Offer recommendations for adjustments that promote inclusivity, cultural sensitivity, and diversity in the instructional materials. Ensure that the revised module aligns with best practices in culturally responsive teaching and learning.

1c5zqgs,25,2024-04-16,Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) Spring 2024 Way-Too-Long Review,u/AcceptableDistance94,OMSCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/1c5zqgs/humancomputer_interaction_hci_spring_2024/,"**TLDR:** Good course. Highly structured and rewards consistent effort/engagement, punishing to procrastinators or poor English writers. 

(**Background:**  mid-40's, career government IT manager, native English speaker. This is my first OMSCS class; I have a liberal arts BA/MBA from the 00's, and a newly acquired BSCS. I am on track for a low A in the class. I like academic stuff.)

**What is this course about?** It's in the title: how humans interact with computers. It is multidisciplinary, drawing material from CS, design, and social sciences. UI/UX design is a subset. 

**Things I liked:** 

* **Overall content.** The lectures are a few years old, but still relevant and interesting. Half of the course is going over how humans work and how to [better design for them](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/); the other half is putting that into practice via the [design life cycle](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-hci-life-cycle/).
* **Structure**. You are given a calendar that spells out exactly what to do every week, with precise time estimates. (Estimates are baselined at 10 hours/week; I found that to be roughly accurate, but someone with slow reading/writing speed will take more time.)
* **Individual project.** ~25-page paper plus screenshots and a ~5-minute video of your completed design. Seems like a lot, but seven weeks was plenty of time to complete, and the content does a good job of translating the lectures into actual work that helps the concepts stick. 15% of grade.
* **Tests.** Effectively 150 T/F questions, broken into 30 groups of 5. 2 hours, open-everything. Moderately challenging, but if you've read the assigned material you should be able to Ctrl+F your way to what you don't know, and the questions are generally fair. Midterm and final, each 10% of grade.
* **Instructor communication**. Dr. Joyner is the /r/omscs OG, and it shows. He actively communicates on the course forums, with multi-paragraph responses to student questions. Man's got jokes.
* **Embrace of LLM's.** Instead of ignoring them or banning them, you get guidelines for use and integration into the course. Super happy about this.


**Things I had mixed feelings about**:

* **Homework assignments**. Four assignments, each with four essay questions requiring 1-2 page answers. Some of the questions are well-done and well-thought out. Some are not, and feel like busywork. Homework 4 is particularly criticized as part of it requires you to find four academic papers on your own and discuss how they relate to the course content; I think this assignment is fine and I enjoyed it, but it should probably be standalone. 20% of grade.
* **Class participation.** You get participation credit primarily via peer feedback on other classmates' assignments, posting on the discussion forum, or completing surveys.  This is idiosyncratic to me, but I enjoy teaching and coaching so I liked doing peer feedback. Others skipped the peer feedback and just filled out lots of surveys, which is probably a more efficient use of time. I have this in the mixed category as a lot of the feedback I received was fairly low-quality, and it can be a slog later in the course. 10% of grade. 
* **Readings.** The assigned readings in the first half of the course are generally very good, with no more than two per lesson and the readings being referenced in the lectures. The reading quality tails off significantly in the second half of the course, with more readings assigned that are less well-connected to the content. The two ""Conclusion"" lessons are egregious here, with five academic papers each as ""example research from the field."" One or two would be fine, but ten is overkill, especially since HW4 requires you to find four separate papers on your own. Dr. Joyner decided mid-course to pre-disclose which reading would be tested on each quiz, which helps a lot, but they're all on the test so you still have to read all of them. 
* **Team project**. The team project is a repeat of the individual project, now with a group. In theory this helps you perfect what you've done before and do it in more detail, but in practice it just feels like going through the motions of something you've already done. Add to this the usual group project roulette and I didn't get a lot out of this, but it was relatively painless (albeit I had a good group). 15% of grade.
* **Check-ins.** Both projects require you to turn them in 4 times (at various stages of completion) for peer feedback. Meh. 

**Things I didn't like:**


* **Lecture structure.** The lectures were originally a Udacity-style course (think lots of short 1-5 min videos) that has been cut into sections. Some videos have been added along the way, as well as simple participation exercises.  In general, it works, but now that there are quizzes I think a more structured, explicit approach would be useful (see the section on quizzes).
* **No textbook/primary reference.** Personal preference; I prefer reading to watching, so halfway through the course I ended up reading the transcripts. 
* **Quizzes.** They made the decision this semester to cut back on the previous ten homework assignments and insert four closed-book quizzes in their place, due to ChatGPT. I get why this was done, but the quizzes are pretty stressful. Each quiz is two hours and 5 essay questions, with 4 from the lectures and 1 from a pre-identified reading. You're allowed to answer in bullets, but that didn't help me much as the questions are pretty substantive. My main issue, though, is that the lecture format and the quizzes don't work very well together. Due to the way the short-form videos work, it can be hard sometimes to tell what is a main point, what is a supplementary point, and what is color. This makes it tough to study. Adding to this is a few of the quiz questions, which ask you to respond in multi-paragraph depth to concepts that get only a paragraph of discussion in the lectures. 20% of the grade.
* **Late grading/no return of answers.** For tests/quizzes you get a grade with feedback, but it's often hard to contextualize since the feedback frequently doesn't reference the question or your answer. I understand why it has to be this way, but it makes asking for regrades challenging. 

**5 Tips for Success in HCI:** 

1. Procrastination snowballs hard on you here. You need to do the assignments to help solidify the concepts for the quizzes, and the way the project works requires you to do multiple surveys, which take time to get responses, etc. 
2. Google Docs or LaTeX for assignments. You have to use a custom format (JDF), but it's relatively painless in either GDocs or LaTeX/Overleaf. Not so much in Word.
3. Figma is the ""default"" choice for doing design prototypes and is fine, but I found Balsamiq much easier.  
4. For the tests, downloading all the readings to a folder and using something that can search multiple PDF's is helpful. (I experimented with loading them into an LLM and didn't find it particularly helpful, but future LLM's may do better here.) 
5. For both tests and quizzes, if you have concerns about a question/answer, take a note of it immediately after the test so you can reference it later.

**Overall:** 4/5 stars. Recommended for those who like multidisciplinary things, design, and heavily structured courses (also a great OMSCS intro course imo). Not recommended for those who prefer working only in code, thinking about human/user behavior, or irregular availability.",active,34
1c6ecqc,1,2024-04-17,"""ChatGPT Revolutionizing Online Learning: Impacts on Corporate Training and Education""",u/cporter202,ChatGPTautomation,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTautomation/comments/1c6ecqc/chatgpt_revolutionizing_online_learning_impacts/,"The emergence of AI-driven platforms like ChatGPT has brought about a transformative change in the landscape of online learning. With its advanced natural language processing capabilities, ChatGPT offers an interactive and personalized learning experience that can be tailored to the needs of individuals across various learning environments, including corporate training and education sectors.

In corporate training, ChatGPT has the potential to streamline the onboarding process, offering new employees a way to engage with training material that's both interactive and responsive to their specific queries. It can simulate real-world scenarios and provide instant feedback, which is critical for learning and retaining new information. 

For the education sector, the introduction of AI tutors like ChatGPT can supplement traditional teaching methods, providing students with access to 24/7 assistance. It can break down complex concepts into digestible explanations and provide students with a platform to practice and hone their skills without the pressure of a classroom setting.

Moreover, ChatGPT's ability to constantly learn and adapt makes it an invaluable tool for creating a dynamic and up-to-date curriculum that can adjust to the latest industry trends, ensuring that the workforce remains competitive.

However, this technology also poses certain challenges. It raises questions about the role of human instructors and the potential for over-reliance on AI for educational needs. Ensuring that the way we integrate tools like ChatGPT into learning environments enhances rather than replaces the human element is critical.

Let's discuss how the integration of AI like ChatGPT can be optimized for corporate training and education. How do you see this technology shaping the future of learning, and what measures should be taken to balance its advantages with the need for human insight and expertise?",active,1
1c6gkiq,5,2024-04-17,Boards fucked me up. [Not by marks],u/GiantJupiter45,JEENEETards,https://www.reddit.com/r/JEENEETards/comments/1c6gkiq/boards_fucked_me_up_not_by_marks/,"The TL;DR is there.

# Class 11. (Burnout)

That oblivious me was very very happy - he was going to learn advanced concepts in Maths after all. Bhannat Maths gave him the curiosity he needed. In class X, this guy watched Binomial Theorem from this sir. Even after requesting, his parents didn't even exclude Chemistry. That kid knew what was going to happen, he got the highest in Chemistry in ICSE (got 99% or 100%), but he couldn't keep the concepts of Chemistry in his mind. He had to comply even after the rebellion. He got good marks in Physics. Although he liked Maths, he wasn't that good at it.

So... let's shift to first-person pronouns.

Ours was the post-pandemic batch. Our session was completed within 9 months.

\[Making bullet points for easy TL;DR creation by ChatGPT\]

Physics in School:

* There was a teacher who tried to teach, while there was another teacher (let's call her A) who literally said to understand which one's the sin component (vertical) and which one's the cos (horizontal). \[9s1 had a question where the correct answer was W sin theta, I could answer that correctly but I won't forget how the teacher taught us\]
* Our teacher quite literally thought as if we had already studied the chapter. More on A later.

Chemistry in School:

* OK... GOC wasn't taught properly/I didn't have the right guidance at home I guess... I didn't even understand how did they get those absurd whole-number ratios in the 1st chapter of Class 11.
* I tried to self-study Thermodynamics and could only master the Thermodynamics of Physical Chem, not of Physics. Practicals were always fun; except that, I forgot everything about 11th Chem.

Maths in School:

* We had a chill sir who taught us beautifully. But he didn't teach Mathematical Reasoning🥺 it's a CS student's favourite chapter.

Eventually, we got our canon event quite early (because our school used to take revision tests just after finishing a chapter). I don't know if those were haphazard checking or genuine mistakes... but we used to get very low marks. If I compare these low marks to the test frequencies, personally, I used to get overwhelmed. I used to stay up late at night just to TRY to prepare for the next day. Eventually, I became a nocturnal being and I still am a nocturnal being. During this time, I burnt out too (I won't tell you how). After burning out, I just thought:

[Needless to say, I interpreted it in a pessimistic and sarcastic manner.](https://preview.redd.it/s1d9rc8g72vc1.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=1eaf201d0d1b4a925a6648c1af5f75bda85211b6)

I just stopped caring for those exams.

My parents were disappointed as usual. I hated their disappointment.

However, I got good marks as usual in English, Bengali and CS.

Science in Tuitions:

* I took a course in Physics Wallah for 6000 rupees. In the orientation classes, all the hollow quotes of motivation were given along with the very useful tip which can make flowers into fruits, is: ""Don't be in a relationship at least during these two years."" BS. Plain BS. They also told us to buy earplugs though, because the distraction could hamper our studies. BUT MY PARENTS - oh my parents, they told me not to use earplugs, because they would apparently LIKE TO LISTEN TO MY LECTURES, like, they also said that if I can't educate my whole locality, then my study is incomplete. What about me? They talked to themselves a bit too much and when I told them to stop, they didn't. Also, my father lectured me to start from the middle, watch the episodes the very day and clear the backlogs simultaneously. Now, I can't do that. I am a VERY lazy individual. If you tell me that I will fail, yes I will fail, yes I want to fail, yes I want to fail so much in life that I want \[REDACTED\]. Ok? Satisfied? \[This is the present me btw\]
* I was admitted to a Science tuition, where Physics, Chem and Maths were all taught. The tutor thought that I would score good marks in these two years as well. After the half-yearly results, I left the tuition.
* There was a coaching centre nearby, where I went to study. It was the first day. The first day. Thermodynamics was being taught. I had that portion already studied by myself. While I was laughing in class along with the others, the teacher saw me and told me that he could see my rectum \[I wasn't covering my mouth while laughing\]. The others laughed even more soundly. Do you know how it felt? If you are a Bengali and read the story Ginni by Tagore (গিন্নি; transliterated: गिन्नि), you'll understand exactly how I felt:

>Then his face and ears became bright red with laughter, the veins on his painful forehead swelled, and his profuse tears could not be stopped.

* I just didn't cry, my ears didn't become red, but I was laughing and the veins on my forehead were...
* It may sound silly, but if I give you the context, you'll understand why.
* That day, my unrequited first love told me that she could go with me to a fair in our school, at... 6 pm. I just couldn't go there because it was the first day of my tuition and my parents gave 10-12 thousand rupees as admission fees. From that day, it just went on like a domino effect. I left the tuition just a few days before the final exams of Class 11.

Only my friends and AMV-making (as a hobby) saved me from the scary world out there. Oh yes, I wrote about most of these in my final term essay. I got 16 out of 20 in that essay.

[I even made an incomplete AMV on this. It's imperfect though.](https://www.reddit.com/r/amv/comments/14676vi/bentovid_rice_contest_giantjupiter_electrophilic/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

Day after day, as my grades deteriorated, I subconsciously thought that my unrequited obsession towards that girl was the cause. But I said no always. And I still believe the same, because whenever anything gives you a failure, it gives you experience. I was fiercely protective of my love. When my mother said the stereotypical Bengali racist stuff towards... well, I just told my mother to mind her language.

Also, in the starting days, that girl was harassed online by some classmate of her. I still regret to this day that along with her, I also thought about the boy. I felt like there was some backstory of the boy's own which made him do this. I ensured if she was fine, she indeed was fine and she told me not to worry about her. However, I heard in class that while recollecting the details of the incident in front of the teacher, she burst into tears. I have no idea what, and I don't even want to know.

# Class 12. (Severe feelings of.)

Anyway, I thought I would do everything possible to improve my Class XII progress.

I went to Puri with my parents. There, after having the darshan of Jagannath Temple, I was watching the flag. It was waving high. The air was silent, but the people weren't. It felt quite profound. As I was standing barefoot waiting for my shoes, I had the thought. Silences. Khaamoshiyan. Yes, that's how it all felt. I was doing the AMV as some sort of God's wish... I don't know if it's my own calling, but whatever...

After returning from Puri, just 1 week later, I saw that the three trains collided. I was quite shocked to see that news.

Anyway, as I started doing the AMV, I downloaded the first entry of SciADV (Steins;Gate is a part of this franchise): Chaos;Head NoAH. IT WAS AMAZING, 1000X BETTER THAN DDLC, though I played without the Committee of Zero patch, so I need to replay the game.

Anyway, I came across a scene, which reminded me of a very interesting phenomenon, which I forgot. Then I had flashbacks to Class XI when I couldn't even complete anything except SHM.

Our teacher, Ms. A, explained Coulomb's Law and Electric Fields, in the middle of the year, and literally finished it within a class of 40 minutes (Remember that we had derivations too, and she spent half the time wasting on derivations). It was like a revision class, it wasn't taught like it was in the curriculum.

Everything went on like this, until December. The visual novel was complete, I had to fill in the third stanza of my AMV. Then, my preboards started knocking at the door.

\[Continuing after a 2-hour failed brainwashing of my parents. I feel like crying now. After my board results, my neighbours will get something to judge upon...\]

Physics: We studied under a new teacher, who operates Reddit, (and maybe is seeing the post) who taught us the various parts of magnetism and all, and Ms. A taught us the portion of Electricity. I could understand the former's teaching, but I didn't revise it after returning to my home. I was genuinely burnt out. Ms. A taught us capacitors so beautifully that I realised that series and parallel have different formulae while she was out there making us solve numericals like it was some conscription. I remember my friend being an expert in Electricity and Magnetism. Shoutout to the dude :)

Chemistry: While preparing for the first chapter, I thought that Haloarenes weren't necessary. I omitted that part before going to the revision test. I was wrong, and that backlog served as a cascade effect for my messed up Organic.

Maths: Still Loving You.

One day, I dispersed from my school quite late, because I had some work to do in the Computer Lab. My friend was absent that day. While leaving the school, I saw that the streets were deserted, as if 20 minutes ago, there weren't anyone in that area. There, while going towards the main road, I saw two people coming from the main road to that alleyway. Those two were my unrequited love and someone else: someone who proposed her alongside me. I was genuinely happy, but I knew that my emotional slope during these times were negative, even if the slope was very low. So, I quickly embarked on the autorickshaw and reached my home.

Even after a few days, I saw her, smiling. But after that, when I looked at her, she was angry. She was filled with disgust. Extreme disgust. It was as if her eyes would shoot lasers at me.

When they were talking in a secluded room of the school, I asked them to excuse me and told them to write a farewell note (I knew the waters, so I told them that its optional to write down the note). She didn't write the note, her date did. He has always been friends with me.

Anyway, after a few days, while our farewell photos were being captured, she wasn't angry anymore. She wasn't even looking at me anymore.

My main question the whole life will be: why. Why did she do that?

During my preboards, I was very much overwhelmed.  I was so overwhelmed before the night of my Chemistry exams that I thought of \[REDACTED\]. I just studied Organic Chem however I could. I couldn't touch anything else. Also, my mother tore the pages of the book for no reason.

The result? 19/70 in Physics and 20/70 in Chemistry.

I finished my AMV on Jan 9.

I posted it in a competition.

From then on, I felt a sense of insecurity. I felt hyperventilated. I created an alt account to vocalize my struggles (I will only share it through DMs).

I got a few virtual people by me.

I took JEE during this time. In the 1st attempt, got 67th percentile in total, having 85th percentile in maths. In this attempt, I just answered 12 questions, so I don't expect much. The main thing is I didn't even revise anything before taking any of the attempts.

One day, while enduring that hell, I had a dream. A dream where she was with her friends. Mountainside, parking lot jutting out of the mountain, 8:00 pm, the light was falling on them. I was going from the dark to the light side. She was happy seeing me, she hugged me.

When I woke up, it was all an illusion. I realised that she's in a relationship with someone else, I shouldn't have such thoughts. But mind is something complex in itself :). It felt like a story of pity and tragedy.

I was really scared of my parents. I wanted to escape. I do want to escape.

NO, I DON'T WANT TO UNDERSTAND THE REALITY, I DON'T WANT TO HAVE COMMON SENSE, I DON'T WANT STORIES WITH MORAL LESSONS.

I can say that I have survived the ordeal. I somehow took my Boards.

I don't care if I get 1% or 100%, I have the fear that because of my screams towards my parents, the neighbours will get a scope. They'll judge me blatantly.

And I am not even sure of which degree to pursue upon.",active,10

1c6lvii,5,2024-04-17,I’m in school and I’m not retaining much of anything. Am I screwed?,u/-i--am---lost-,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1c6lvii/im_in_school_and_im_not_retaining_much_of/,"So I’ll try to keep this concise, but I have a tendency to give too much information and write walls of text. 

I’m 29 and a little over half way through my bachelors degree in Business Administration. It’s been a long road to get here. I did terrible in high school (1.6 GPA at grad) and had no idea what to do after graduation, except that I “wanted to be rich.” I was young and oh so dumb. No clue how the world worked. I eventually started smoking a lot of weed, developed depression, lost all my friends, and lived with my parents doing nothing but video games and a shitty part time job. Dug myself into a deep credit card debt hole buying lots of bullshit. Still working my way out of it, but making progress. 

Fast forward to my 26th birthday, and I finally decided it was time to try and grow up. I quit weed and enrolled in community college. It was a very rough start. Eventually got into the swing of things and took classes while working. Around 27 I got my first corporate job at a large local company. Started VERY entry level, no degree requirement, job. Started to get noticed early on and then promoted. 

Fast forward to today and I’m currently in another division in an entry level role, but it’s one that typically requires a degree. The money is fine but by no means great. Maybe great for someone without a degree or prior experience, like a recent college grad. But I’m about to turn 30. 

Now, to my main question and concern. While I’m “technically” doing OK in school (3.0 gpa), most of that has been from lenient grading and some cheating here and there (ChatGPT 4 has been a godsend). I absolutely hate school and am literally only here because I want a 4 year degree for backup. I was diagnosed with ADHD as a kid, but I have an atypical version of it, I’d say. I’m not jittery or super inattentive. I remember where I put basically everything except the occasional thing, which I think is normal. I don’t lose stuff. But I can’t seem to do well as a student. 

It sucks because I LOVE learning. I’m super curious and research everything and anything that I come across. I don’t retain most of it, which might be ADHD and might be brain rot from years of weed and instant gratification via internet and phone, but the desire is definitely there. I know how to dig for info (or so I think I do). But remembering it can be hard, and it’s especially hard in school, where I resist learning like a kid asked to eat broccoli. It’s like nothing has changed since high school. I still put off work and scramble at the last minute, creating mediocre at best work. 

Right now I’m doing a lot of business analytics and statistics courses, and they’re probably the worst I’ve done in college so far. I’m not taking my time to learn these things, so I just end up using ChatGPT or learning just enough in a night to complete an assignment right before it’s due. If you asked me to tell you what I’ve learned, I literally couldn’t tell you. Maybe a couple things if you jogged my memory, but nothing feels applicable with my current understanding. 

I know math is important in entrepreneurship, and I was reading threads on here that talked about the importance of knowing statistics and algebra. I’m feeling very depressed and angry at myself right now for not “properly” learning any of this. I don’t even remember anything from micro or macroeconomics. 

It’s making me feel like I’ll never make it in entrepreneurship, if I were to give it a try. 

After writing this, I don’t really know what my question is. Maybe to vent, but really I think I just want advice or wisdom. Will being a super curious individual be enough to succeed if an opportunity arises? ",User_deleted,5

Even if they are just using ChatGPT to ""get going,"" students miss out on exercising their creative-invention skills. If a student is only doing the easy parts of the writing process, or relying on something (or someone else) to do it for them, then they are not learning.

I get that writing is not easy for the vast majority of people, but so what? It's the process of writing that is important for individual student learning, not the paper itself. College is not a content mill. The actual papers mean so little to me compared to them being able to learn how to write.

I'm thinking of shifting all my points in class to be on the processes of writing (topic invention done in class, drafts maybe done by hand or with recorded proof of the process like taking a few screenshots along the way, collecting sources, annotations, etc.) and making my final papers equivalent to next-to-nothing.

1c77pp1,1,2024-04-18,Leveraging ChatGPT for Enhanced Data Analysis and Reporting in Various Sectors,u/cporter202,ChatGPTautomation,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTautomation/comments/1c77pp1/leveraging_chatgpt_for_enhanced_data_analysis_and/,"As we continue to witness the rise of sophisticated AI tools, there's been significant buzz around OpenAI's ChatGPT and its potential applications. One area where ChatGPT seems particularly poised for impact is in the field of data analysis and reporting across different sectors. 

The power of ChatGPT lies in its language comprehension and generation abilities. This means it can understand complex data insights and communicate them in a simple, human-like manner. For analysts, this can be a game-changer in how they convey data outcomes to decision-makers who may not be well-versed in technical jargon.

Let's dive into some sectors and discuss how ChatGPT can be a catalyst for enhanced data analysis and reporting:

**Finance:** In banking and finance, ChatGPT can analyze trends and generate reports that forecast market movements, helping analysts make informed decisions and provide strategic advice to clients using easily digestible language.

**Healthcare:** By processing medical data, ChatGPT can assist in developing comprehensive reports that summarize patient information, treatment outcomes, or public health trends, supporting healthcare professionals in making patient-centered decisions.

**Retail:** ChatGPT can help retailers understand customer behavior by analyzing transaction data, customer feedback, and market trends, creating reports that assist in inventory planning, marketing strategies, and overall business growth.

**Education:** Educational institutions can benefit from ChatGPT by analyzing student performance data and feedback to generate reports that could enhance curricula and teaching methodologies.

**Government:** Public sector agencies can employ ChatGPT to analyze large volumes of public data, creating reports that inform policy-making, resource allocation, and public services enhancement.

For data analysts, introducing ChatGPT into their toolbox could mean spending less time on generating reports and more time on strategic analysis. This shift could lead to more insightful, action-oriented discussions within organizations and a stronger data-driven culture.

However, integration of ChatGPT for these purposes must be deliberate and ethical, ensuring clear privacy guidelines and accuracy checks are in place. Embracing such AI tools can lead us to a future where data is not just crunched but is also communicated and leveraged in the most effective ways across sectors.

1c7q22p,1,2024-04-19,Should I take a gap year after graduating?,u/Infinite_Article5003,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1c7q22p/should_i_take_a_gap_year_after_graduating/,"I'm 21, I've been studying computer science and going to graduate end of this year. But I'm not your average comp sci student, i got into it due to my passion of creating products, but uni hasn't been liked this, focusing on theoretical coding/math which I'm extremely bad at (Ive always been like this). I've barely passed most of my courses through memorization, asking many questions, and spending lots of time through brute force. I haven't truely learnt or understood much. I don't know, I've just always been like this since school, I can put lots of time into things I'm passionate about, but not efficiently or with good coding standards.

As such, I'm not confident in my abilities so I'm not looking forward to getting my first job (I've been on the doll). I will have like 30k in HECs, and 25k in the bank by graduation, which I'm at a crossroads of putting into HISA or ETFs but that isn't the point of this post.

I also have had been amazed by stuff like chatgpt, I've kept up with all of the research and developments. It's been a light in the tunnel, but also a dark one, for someone like me who isn't smart. Dark in the sense that if I take a gap year, I'm almost sure ill come back to systems which are nearing the point of making me obsolete in the work force. It might not be there yet but its semantics at that point, it'll happen in the next year or two if it isn't.

However, it is also amazing because it can then help me to create all the ideas I have, and I could be some baby enterpreneur. I would LOVE if it worked out like this and i could finance it.

And I havent really gotten to travel. I've been told if I travel after graduating it'll be harder for me to find a job afterwards. This is concerning because I'm already not confident in finding a job. And my friends and family will keep asking me what I'm doing and I just hate that, I just want to be left alone. And I genuinely think I'll only get to work a couple of years before AI makes me pointless in the workforce. It sounds nice for me to travel for X months and come back to a different reality where i can see where my skills may be needed elsewhere. As for my travelling, I'm not sure where I'd go yet, but I'd love to backpack solo and travel on the cheapest of shoestrings. By working while I'm overseas (even though i've never worked before) and couch surfing, or pet sitting, or sleeping in a hamac, id hopefully limit costs so that I won't be taking $ out of the bank. also not sure how long i could go for but the more the merrier I say? I'll practice it in australia before before going overseas.

And most importantly, expectations of my future and my wants/needs:

I do not care to have a family, I do not care for a house, I'd much rather a hotel next to public transit in a walkable city. I don't have a car and I don't plan on getting one (I have my license but I just hate driving so I don't). I really hate the rat race of society which is likely why ive not worked a day in my life or done too well at uni. How I've been treated while on the doll has reaffirmed this, and mental health has declined just from this idea of how people treat you differently. It's actually made me want to work **less** because I'm really stubborn and if someone annoys or patronizes me I **hate** taking their advice. I would rather sacrifice my livelihood by living as cheaply as possible while still feeling secure by having access to necessities ie food/power/sleep then to constantly focus on money. For what? Just so I can afford to eat out, shop and buy junk or go on some extravagent travel? I'd rather cook something myself (even if I dont have many of the skills atm), only buy necessities that I really really need, or go on cheap travels and experience the country in a less touristy manner. As such, I do not really care if i get 200k, 100k or 50k as my annual income, I already don't spend money as is (Thats how ive got 20k in the bank without working. I do live with my parents though.). All I really want and value is time, so I can focus on other parts of my life.

Also, I have like 0 life skills but im willing to learn if i'm not patronized constantly, which is the main reason I haven't up until now. That's a big reason why I want to travel and work overseas or live with others.

1c8czeb,1,2024-04-19,Academic Integrity and ChatGPT: Should I fight this battle as a PhD student? ,u/Other_Competition913,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1c8czeb/academic_integrity_and_chatgpt_should_i_fight/,"I'm a PhD student. This is my third semester teaching. I had surgery mid-way through the semester, and we had to go remote for about a month (based on my doctor's guidance). I only cancelled one class during my recovery, but I noticed that engagement in the course dropped considerably during this time, and never really rebounded. I'm usually a pretty animated speaker, but once I got back to class, I had to sit down to teach due to the effects of my surgery (I was on crutches and couldn't stand for more than 15 minutes at a time).

Since I returned to the classroom, I've had some major concerns about academic dishonesty.

In my class, I have one written group assignment (worth 10% of grades), and one extra credit essay (a bonus 5% boost).  Students are given more than a month to complete these projects. I also have weekly short answer quizzes and discussion boards. I don't really enforce the use of generative AI for discussion boards and quizzes. Although I explicitly forbid it in my syllabus- sometimes I will let things slide, since these assignments are only worth a few points a piece.

However, I enforce my gen AI policy for the higher point written assignments with more scrutiny.

I run my assignments through ChatGPT and Quiltbot to make sure students aren't copy and pasting output in their submissions. I've caught a number of students using ChatGPT throughout the semester for my written assignments- either through the existence of hallucinated citations, or based on output that is formatted and written in a way that is EXTREMELY similar to the output I get when I test run my projects.

I caught one group who clearly used the platform for their group project. They got their work in early, so I gave them the option to redo their paper in time for the original deadline. I included a copy of my output from ChatGPT to show the similarities. This group thanked me for being accommodating, promised to submit a version that was not plagiarized, and resubmitted the assignment after the deadline that paraphrased the original output. I have already submitted one report regarding academic dishonesty to the provost this semester for hallucinated citations in their extra credit essay.

At this point, I'm not sure what to do. I have already given the group a 0 , and asked them to meet me in person to discuss what happened- with the option to reevaluate the score depending on the conversation. I will be on the market next year, and I'm afraid of having bad student evaluations. I feel like there's a high probably that the students who I caught cheating will give me poor scores if I enforce this. Although my previous scores have been above average for the department, I feel like my lecturing skills suffered during the time I was remote (and on crutches). I don't want the students I caught to push me over the edge.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**TLDR: As a PhD student who will be on the market next year, how tolerant should I be regarding the obvious use of gen aI? Should I be more tolerant than I normally would be knowing that the students had a major disruption to learning this year? Will enforcing this policy adversely impact my student evaluations? Or should I stick to my guns and enforce the policies laid out in my syllabus?**",active,0

I don't want the curriculum to adapt to the usage of these language models. I want professors to find a way to eliminate it's usage among students entirely. I truly believe it's have a net negative result in academia.

I attend a community college. My major is IT and I cannot trust that the majority of my classmates know what they're talking about. It's almost maddening and I have to believe that if ChatGPT did not exist that these same students would have either tried to actually engage with the material or drop out entirely.

I had to do a group project for one of my network engineering classes. Fine. Upon meeting with the group it became increasingly evident that none of them knew anything about the class. They'd struggle to define the very basics to me and some of them hadn't even setup their development environments. This is the final project, worth 50% of my grade, and all of the work that my groupmates produced was both GPT generated and of poor quality.

There's no functional utility to be had by using ChatGPT to generate your code for you when you're a STUDENT LEARNING the basics of a programming paradigm/essay structure/project management etc. I've tried to have these conversations irl with my friends but they truly believe that they're benefiting from learning the material via ChatGPT.",User_deleted,16

I've been teaching courses online since the start of online teaching years ago. I'd like to think I know what I'm doing. But after this semester, I'm legit stymied.

* If I assign a paper, they use ChatGPT (even reflection papers) and my university doesn't support us in pursuing academic dishonesty claims for AI written work. 
* If I assign a discussion board, they use ChatGPT and...still no university support. 
* If I assign a test, they copy it and put it on CourseHero or Quizlet or Chegg or whatever it is. (I'm on all of them with burner accounts; my stuff is readily avail. (Note also: we don't offer lockdown browser.)
* If I assign even simple-completion exercises, they use ChatGPT rather than thinking for themselves about a topic. 
* Sure, I can assign a creative endeavor (e.g. an infographic, a vlog, etc.) but I still see ChatGPT in there (or hear it as they're obviously reading the ChatGPT generated script from an off-camera source next to their laptops).

I have one class online rn where *no less* than 75% of them are cheating their way through the class.

I know I should stop caring more than my employer does because I get paid either way, but it's way easier to say that than to embrace it.

I'm sincere when I ask this: **what are people doing with their online classes to make students maintain even a shred of academic integrity in this environment ?**

1cbdzgc,2,2024-04-23,Class did bad on an assignment and now is freaking out ,u/firewall245,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1cbdzgc/class_did_bad_on_an_assignment_and_now_is/,"I suppose this is the bed I made and now need to lie in. I teach a proof based math class for computer science majors, so many students struggle with thinking in the way that is required for the problems.

As such, my office hours the days that assignments are due are filled with students asking for help because they are struggling to understand and need heavy hand holding. This also always comes after two weeks of the assignment being posted and getting no emails from anyone at all asking for assistance. This aspect could partially be on me though as since I only teach part time and have a 9-5 my office hours are very limited. 

I normally don’t mind the hand holding as I’d rather them get a walk through from me where they have to learn it, rather than chatGPT where they’d learn nothing. 

That being said this past assignment was a code assignment in which I gave them 2 challenging code problems (one leetcode one icpc) that they had to solve. Due to just extenuating circumstances I was unable to hold office hours for this assignment, but felt confident that since they were CS majors they could figure it out.

Well I was mistaken, the class collectively did horrible. Everyone except two students got the icpc question wrong, and half of the students got the leetcode question wrong, which is also a modified version of a problem that we had gone over in class already in the semester. 

With the second problem I can kind of understand as the wording was fairly confusing, but in the class period before it was due I walked through examples, and nobody reached out over email. I think they were waiting for office hours and when I didn’t hold them they were screwed. 

For the first problem it was a clear case of them not checking their code. Everyone’s solution passed the example test cases in the file, but even basic modifications to them would have shown their solution was wrong. 

Now I’m not sure what to do because it has tanked collectively nearly everyone’s grades by docking around 3.5% from everyone’s final average. 

I feel bad but also frustrated enough where I don’t know if I want to shown mercy by offering extra credit or something ",User_deleted,3

Both [this year](https://www.reddit.com/r/IntltoUSA/comments/1bq97pv/didnt_get_into_your_top_choices_or_just_want_help/) and [last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/IntltoUSA/comments/126hryz/didnt_get_the_results_you_wanted_or_do_you_just/), I offered to review 50 applications of students who were puzzled with their results or just wanted some guidance on their choices. Between these and other applications I review as part of my work, I’ve read hundreds of complete application packages (or all except letters of recommendation). Although I haven’t personally worked as an admissions officer, I’ve sat down (virtually) with former admissions officers from MIT, Stanford, Yale, Cornell, and UChicago to go through dozens of my students’ applications, so I have a good idea of what top schools are looking for. We typically spend about half an hour discussing each application, a similar amount of time to a real application review.

I’m privileged to be able to work with a wide range of applicants and families every year: those from “feeder” schools and those who are the first to apply abroad from their high school; politically connected families and members of persecuted minorities; children of C-level executives at Fortune Global 500 companies and those whose parents were farmers or soldiers and need full-ride scholarships. I don’t envy the job of admissions officers who must choose from among such an extraordinarily talented and diverse applicant pool. 

This post is an overview of the mistakes and weaknesses I tend to see, particularly where outcomes are not as expected based on a student’s profile. A lot of this is based on intuition and pattern-recognition rather than quantification, but that reflects the subjective process itself. I generally combine this outlook with a data-driven approach (more on that in future posts).

There are two important principles to remember about colleges when you think about the admissions process and evaluate what admissions representatives tell you:

1) Colleges are businesses, not charities.

2) Colleges try to maintain an appearance of fairness while implementing admissions policies that are unfair by design.

In general, international students applying to competitive universities and/or seeking financial aid need to:

1) Demonstrate that they are, without a doubt, prepared for a rigorous liberal arts curriculum.

2) Establish that they would contribute to their campus as representatives of their country.

These principles will crystallize as I discuss mistakes students and families make throughout the admissions process. 

## Mistake #1: Improperly addressing or attempting to compensate for low grades

If you’re aiming for the most competitive colleges and/or generous financial aid packages, you need a stellar academic record. For the most competitive programs, it’s very difficult to overcome low grades. Introducing so-called “excuses” such as family stresses and mental health issues may actually do more harm than good. Colleges want to accept students who perform well under pressure. So, while a dip in grades might be understandable, there are likely other applicants out there who faced similar circumstances and did not see their grades drop. Acute illness during exam season may be an acceptable reason for a low grade or two, but chronic health issues (mental or physical) don’t instill confidence that you will maintain consistent academic performance. If such a condition has been treated, sufficient documentation of this treatment and a positive prognosis is advised.

There’s also, in my opinion, an over-reliance on predicted grades, especially after a relatively weaker 11th grade result. Yes, you and/or your counselor can explain grading practices such as grade deflation in 11th, but at the end of the day, there are applicants at other schools (and likely even your school) who have a better record. The only way to compensate for lower 11th grade marks is with a full year of 12th grade marks. In the past I’ve seen Indian CBSE students with 11th grade marks in the 80s or even high 70s get into Ivies. It still happens, but it’s much rarer now. Sometimes I even recommend that families avoid sending their children to schools that practice this type of grade deflation if they have the choice.

## Mistake #2: Not maximizing standardized test scores

I know this sounds trivial, but there is strategy involved. 

If you’re an international student coming from a curriculum other than IB, standardized tests should be considered a requirement even at test-optional schools. A high score in the SAT RW section especially can help AOs feel confident that you are ready to perform as well as your American and other international peers.

I don’t have enough data to determine whether applying test-optional helps or hurts students with any given score; only colleges themselves will have this data (and I promise you they don’t want to release it). Whether you should submit that 790/730 is context-dependent. In general, the 25th percentile score should be seen as a “floor” and the 75th percentile score as a target. Remember, these are the percentiles for *enrolled* students, not admitted applicants. Yield will tend to be higher among students with relatively lower scores because they’re less likely to have better options, and lower among students with relatively higher scores because they’re more likely to have equal or better options. This means that the average score of *admitted* students is much higher than published percentile numbers would suggest. Typically, the lower 25th percentile is mostly comprised of recruited athletes and U.S. citizens traditionally referred to as “underrepresented minorities.” International students contribute to campus diversity, but they don’t contribute to diversity statistics collected by the U.S. government or used in rankings by influential publications like U.S. News & World Report. There is very little room for international students in the bottom 25% of the standardized test range.

I’m not going to say much more about this because colleges are re-instituting their testing requirements, but a big mistake I see students making is applying too early and not giving themselves time to improve their standardized test scores. And this doesn’t mean just EA/ED vs. RD. Even if the only reason for a gap year is to be able to get a higher score on the SAT/ACT, that may still confer an advantage. (The UCs, the only highly competitive universities that officially didn’t accept test scores taken after senior year, no longer use test scores at all.)

## Mistake #3: Submitting low or no English proficiency scores

The liberal arts curricula at top universities in the U.S. place a large emphasis on small, seminar-style classes with frequent interaction among students and instructors, and engineering schools and CS programs focus heavily on group projects where effective communication is important. Proficiency in reading, writing, speaking, and listening is thus critical.

Because of ChatGPT and other writing aids, admissions officers do not have many indicators left of whether your English is good enough to succeed at a top university in the United States. In order to dispel any doubt about academic preparedness, every student not from the United States, Canada, the UK, Ireland, Australia, or New Zealand should take an English proficiency test. Yes, even if your country is mostly English-speaking. Yes, even if you grew up with English as your first language. Yes, even if your medium of instruction is English. Yes, even if you’re in an IB, A-Level, or American curriculum. Yes, even if you have an 800 on the SAT RW and/or 36 on the SAT English and Writing. No exceptions. 

For competitive undergraduate programs, scholarships, and financial aid, it **does** matter how well you do. Competitive applicants for T20s and aid-granting LACs will have TOEFL of 110+ (with no less than 26 in each section), IELTS of at least 8.0 in each section, or Duolingo English Test of at least 145 in each section. The Writing and Production sections tend to be the most challenging for international students. I recommend TOEFL for most applicants, with IELTS being a reasonable alternative if you’re applying to Commonwealth countries as well. I advise completing the DET only if the other options would be a huge financial burden. 

I frequently encounter students with excellent real-world English conversational ability but low English proficiency scores. Most often, this is due to the test being taken as the student was improving their English and/or didn’t think to retake the test because they achieved the minimum for the schools they were applying to.

I’d be happy to learn about exceptions where students with lower scores got into T20s and full rides from LACs. However, I’ve seen applications where the only perceptible weakness was an IELTS Writing score of 6.5, 7.0, or even 7.5. 

We’ll get to essays and the other written parts of the application, but the better they are, the bigger a red flag a low English proficiency score will be.

## Mistake #4: Not conducting a pre-recorded interview to demonstrate English proficiency and social skills

An increasing number of colleges are accepting InitialView and other pre-recorded interviews. For those unfamiliar, these give students an opportunity to demonstrate their conversational, on-the-spot thinking, and social skills with a largely unscripted interview with a live person. (The general topics are pre-selected randomly, but the follow-up questions are chosen by the interviewer.) The InitialView service was conceived as a way to assure colleges that Chinese students actually spoke English amid concerns over rampant test-cheating and questionable admissions practices. However, this type of service has become useful colleges and a wide range of students both international and domestic, especially in the age of ChatGPT. (I have no affiliation with InitialView.)

These interviews serve a different function from alumni interviews: alumni interviews are not recorded, and the interviewer’s report may or may not include detailed information about the applicant’s demeanor and conversational skills. Recorded interviews are reviewed by the decision-makers, making them an increasingly important part of the admissions process. It’s the component of the application with the closest to a guarantee that “what you see is what you get.”

If you think you might struggle to do well with such a recorded interview, consider taking the time to work on language proficiency and/or social skills until you would. Getting in without one is certainly possible, but understand that without reliable evidence about your preparedness for a college environment, preparedness will always be a “question mark.”


## Mistake #5: Trying to fit too much information into the extracurricular activity section

With a 150-character limit for activity descriptions on the Common App, applicants must strike a balance between information density and communication clarity. While most applications I reviewed did a good job at this, there were a few where I had to read descriptions several times to understand what the activity was. You want the reader to understand the first time they read it. It’s not so much about “scoring points” and amassing accomplishments as it is creating an impression about your passions and how you spent your time. There is an “Additional Information” section with plenty of space for details. The EC section is your first opportunity for AOs to get to know you, and it was disheartening to see students who thought they were highlighting their impressive accomplishments, when what they were mostly doing was tripping up and frustrating their application reader.

**Keep abbreviations, acronyms, and initialisms to those that are widely recognized among American admissions officers even if they are not familiar with your region.** For example, “NASA” is fine, but don't use “ISRO” without writing the full name somewhere. There may be acronyms you’re so used to because of regional use or meaning within your niche, so it's helpful here to have an American-born adult review your application. There are a lot of subtleties. For example, it’s probably fine these days to abbreviate artificial intelligence as “AI,” but I don't recommend using “ML” for machine learning. You can use ampersands for “and,” “~” for “approximately,"" and “+” as shorthand for ""over"" (as in “10+ awards”), but try not to use too many symbols. Even if grammatically and logically correct, too much abbreviation can lead to confusion and frustration.

## Mistake #6: Sloppiness and missing easily fixed mistakes

Admissions officers will tell you to proofread your application–and they mean it. You have months to complete your application, and if you are indeed a top competitive applicant, there is no excuse for anything but a perfectly polished application. Thanks to modern writing aids, essays tend to be much less typo and error-ridden than they used to be. But students often forget to carefully check their EC section. Here are some common yet easily avoidable mistakes:

* Extra spaces at the end of the “Position/Leadership Description” and “Organization Name” fields (which show up before the commas).
* Extra space between paragraphs. The Common App automatically adds space between paragraphs. Including an extra line between paragraphs results in sloppy formatting.
* Improper capitalization (in some countries too much capitalization, in other countries missed capitalization). I won’t go through capitalization conventions, but the most common rule I’ve seen broken is that that **the names of subjects (e.g. math, physics, computer science) are **not** capitalized unless they include otherwise proper nouns/adjectives** (e.g. English, Greek, American history, Middle Eastern studies).
* Improper use of currency symbols. In most English conventions, the currency symbol/abbreviation goes **before** the numerical figure ($500 not 500$). Also, adding “dollars” is redundant (as in “$500 dollars”), and not using a currency symbol is considered incorrect unless the application doesn’t support the symbol. Also, if you include figures in your local currency, also include roughly equivalent USD amounts. Even if they’ve been to India, for example, AOs don’t necessarily know what “1 lakh INR” means.
* Inconsistent use of upper and lower-case K/k to indicate “thousand.” This can get confusing because the SI prefix for one thousand is “k” (as in “km” for kilometers), and lower-case “k” is commonly used in finance, commodities, and commerce. However, a capital “K” is more often used for long-distance runs (5K, 10K, etc.), social media metrics (“100K followers”), and advertisements (“win a $10K scholarship”). In my opinion, a capital K looks “cleaner” in the EC section, but consistency is also important.

Several of the students who signed up for application reviews had hired other professional counselors, and I was surprised that those counselors missed many of these types of mistakes. It was the kind of thing where even if the counselor wasn’t going line-by-line correcting everything, they could have pointed out very easy-to-fix errors in a 10 or 15-minute session.

## Mistake #7: Over-reliance on ChatGPT

Thanks to tools like ChatGPT, Google Docs, Grammarly, and other writing aids, essay readability has increased significantly in recent years—particularly this year. This makes AOs’ jobs easier in that essays generally flow better and are more enjoyable to read, but it makes their job harder because it’s especially difficult for them to “weed out” applicants who clearly aren’t proficient in English at a level required to succeed in a top American university. 

There is much to be said about how to use and not use ChatGPT in the application process, and what is ethically acceptable is being debated and evolving, but I want to focus on things that might reflect poorly on an applicant:

* There has been quite a bit of analysis of words that are supposedly hallmarks of ChatGPT (""tapestry,"" ""delve,"" ""resonate,"" etc.). But most of these words are already common in application essays (which is why ChatGPT uses them in the first place), so it’s difficult to pin an essay on ChatGPT just for those words. A better telltale sign is **inconsistency in apostrophes and quotation marks.** Microsoft Word and Google Docs default to curly quotes (single and double), while ChatGPT defaults to straight ones. If you have a mix, that is a strong suggestion there was copying-and-pasting going on. When you edit directly in the Common App, it also defaults to straight quotes, so ChatGPT is not the only way that can happen, but in either case it’s sloppy. I know that when I see a mix of curly and straight quotes or apostrophes, I become skeptical that the student wrote the parts with the straight quotes. 

* Also be mindful of spelling. Even before ChatGPT, inconsistency in spelling conventions (e.g. American vs. British) suggested that a writing assistance tool was used uncritically at best, or the writing came from multiple sources at worst. If you are going to use ChatGPT to make suggestions, give it custom instructions to adhere to your conventions or American ones. You don’t need to write your application with American spelling and stylistic conventions (although you should consider it if you’re comfortable), but be consistent throughout the application. Using the same word with two different spellings (e.g. honor and honour) is a particularly serious red flag.

* ChatGPT tends to give feedback on essays that includes a suggestion to reflect on what has been written and state why it demonstrates you would succeed in college. This often ends up stale, unconvincing, and unnecessary. Not everything needs to be stated explicitly if it can be conveyed through other means.

I have a lot more to say about ChatGPT and continue to explore ways to use it in the university research and application process, but these are the most significant things I saw reviewing applications this year.

## Mistake #8: Not incorporating a cultural perspective into your essay

Admissions are not fair. The admissions process is not a merit system to decide which applicant is more “deserving” than another. “Fairness” is a concept that has not been used to craft admissions policies in over 100 years. There is a powerful liberal argument that an important role of colleges should be to help achieve more societal equality (especially when those colleges have a history of perpetuating inequality), but colleges have universally concluded that a “fair” admissions process is antithetical to that goal. It’s why the group that successfully sued Harvard and other universities to end race-based affirmative action called themselves “Students for Fair Admissions.” They thought their argument would appeal to people’s innate desire for competitive fairness. And it worked.

Colleges are businesses, not charities. The job of the admissions office is to satisfy a college’s enrollment goals, full stop. So, unless you’re from a specific demographic that’s being targeted, proving your academic and extracurricular worthiness is not enough. 

So what are colleges looking for in international students? Essentially, **ambassadors from their countries.** The most selective universities and all liberal arts colleges that give aid take just a few students from each country. One common thread I saw in applications that were otherwise “perfect” was an essay that was excellent (both in content and style) by objective standards—but could have been written by an applicant from anywhere in the world. There was no real reason to choose this particular applicant as an ambassador from their country when there were so many equally talented applicants from other places. 

Too often, there was “low-hanging fruit” available about which an applicant could discuss their perspective, but that they simply didn’t go for. This omission itself could be seen as a weakness in the application. For example, there was a Russian student living in a country that has fought a major war against Russia, but didn’t talk about that at all, nor the war in Ukraine. Another applicant, from Kazakhstan and interested in aerospace and rocketry, didn’t mention the monumental achievements in spaceflight that have been achieved from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. Someone with an Asian ethnic background that is not well represented in US universities (and with which the United States has a complicated history) chose not to mention it at all. When these obvious topics are omitted from an application, it makes the applicant seem ignorant of history and geopolitics. An “ambassador” needs to be aware of both. (Students with experience in Model UN are particularly expected to have awareness of geopolitics and understand what it means to be an ambassador.) 

Sometimes there were significant cultural and social service-related ECs that sounded both interesting and impressive, but simply didn’t get mentioned elsewhere in the application. This is not to say that your main essay needs to be about your extracurricular activities, but it is generally helpful to weave your major ones in somehow. If your chosen essay topics or the prompts make this impractical, make sure your recommenders elaborate on the significance and impact of the major ECs you have done.

## Mistake #9: Too much “trauma dumping” and “tear-jerking”
Essays aren’t a creative writing contest, especially in the era of ChatGPT. Emotional resonance is important, but for international students it is not the most important thing. In fact, admissions officers increasingly need to divorce themselves from emotional attachment to applicants, as there is no way every compelling application will result in an acceptance. This can lead to too much emphasis on *pathos* backfiring. Familial circumstances, health issues, and other challenges that may make a domestic applicant appealing to a college tend to do the opposite for an international applicant. In almost all instances, international applicants are simply not used to fulfill this particular enrollment goal. Poverty, abuse, addiction, food and/or housing insecurity, and other circumstances that may help admissions officers make a case for domestic students are usually not helpful factors for international students—and may even harm your case. 

If any of these circumstances is due directly to political persecution, you may get more sympathy. But if that’s the case, you need to demonstrate that you’re aware of your country’s politics and desire to be a voice for justice, rather than merely seeking relief from an oppressive situation. You need not just personal resilience, but a vision of a path forward for others in your place. Top colleges are looking for leaders, not refugees.

## Mistake #10: Lacking recommenders who can credibly testify to your ability to succeed at a top college

As a former lawyer, I approach the admissions process like a trial (although not a fair one, as I discussed above). During a trial each side will present witnesses, some of whom will be more credible than others. There are three kinds of witnesses: **Fact** witnesses, **character** witnesses, and **expert** witnesses. 
There are different criteria for evidence from these three types of witnesses to be credible:
* Fact witnesses must have **personal knowledge** of the facts.
* Character witnesses must have familiarity with the litigant’s behavior patterns, community norms, and the litigant’s **reputation in their community**. 
* Expert witnesses must have **proper training and experience** in the particular field in which they are testifying.
Each of your recommenders will act as all three types of witness to some degree, and all types of “testimony” are important. Most top applicants have ample “fact” and “character” witnesses. What is often lacking, particularly from students who don’t attend “feeder” schools, are those who attended or taught at a T20 or liberal arts college. These are individuals who will write the most credible and compelling letters of recommendation (LORs). Anyone can write “[student] would be an asset to any university and succeed wherever they go,” but those words ring hollow if the writer has never experienced or witnessed success at the kind of university you are applying to.

Not everyone knows such a person, but a few times I saw an applicant who had a teacher, mentor, or supervisor who had experience at a T20 but didn’t get an LOR from them. 

For teachers and counselors, the most compelling letters will come from those who graduated from a top university or at least have taught many students who have attended top universities. There are “feeder” schools because colleges can rely on counselors and teachers to provide reliable “testimony” about which students are most likely to succeed. The recommender will be accountable because of their ongoing relationship with the admissions office. A counselor or teacher from a non-feeder school can write anything to puff up a student’s qualifications without consequence. This makes their testimony less compelling.

Students from non-feeder schools are thus generally at a disadvantage, but if they and their families understand this disadvantage, they can compensate for it. For example, if you or your child does not attend a school where faculty and staff have attended top universities, you should develop relationships with such people throughout high school or during a gap year. 

Families often make the mistake of getting a letter of recommendation from a politician instead of someone who might be more persuasive to an admissions office. American admissions offices largely don’t care about what foreign politicians think, with the exception being the heads of state of our closest allies like the UK, Canada, and Australia. And in fact, having a recommendation from a prominent foreign politician may make it seem like another country’s government is pushing a student in order to advance a certain agenda. Whereas a student should be an ambassador of their country and its culture, they are not an ambassador for its government. (There will be exceptions for students whose national governments and royal families have an ongoing relationship with the university, but if you’re one of those people, you’ll know.)

Someone who attended a T20, even if they are a mid-level professional, would be a better pick as a recommender than a regional or even national-level politician. Admissions officers will tell you they’re not impressed by politicians, but they aren’t eager to come out and say that a recommender’s experience at a top university matters, because that would imply that many students are at a disadvantage.

So, if you’re an international student and you aren’t at the top of your class at a feeder school or you’re not a member of a royal family, the admissions process can be challenging. But it is possible to get into top schools, especially if you approach the admissions process strategically and avoid the mistakes I’ve listed.

I look forward to helping more of you this year!

1cc0djt,56,2024-04-24,I had the BEST semester ever except for one student. How was yours?,u/TheMormyrid4,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1cc0djt/i_had_the_best_semester_ever_except_for_one/,"**The Good:** 

I teach two classes because I get credits for research/publishing. This semester, I taught an upper-level creative writing course. It only had six students, which made for amazing class discussions and workshops. Let me tell you, these students were PASSIONATE about their work and about providing feedback. We often accidentally went over time, which is difficult to do in a 3-hour class. Sometimes, the students would ask to come to my office after in order to continue discussing their writing. It was just an amazing vibe, and it was a pleasure to teach such motivated, talented students.   


I also taught an English comp class. Usually, these classes are a bit difficult as students are required to take them and most don't want to be there. I had eight students. Seven of them took the class seriously. They gave it their all and produced thought-provoking work which we workshopped in class. I encouraged them all to find their voice when it came to composition, and they sure as hell did so. The class ended last week, and I've received emails from most of them thanking me and telling me my class was their favorite and that they learned about themselves in addition to learning about writing.   


**The Bad:**   


That English comp class had ONE bad apple. This student spent the entirety of the semester handing in ChatGPT-generated work. I've posted here a few times about him. I ended up going through the whole process of meeting with the student multiple times, submitting my decision to the dean, etc. I finally got proof when he began an essay with ""Although I cannot experience emotions, I can understand how this essay might elicit sympathy in readers"". His midterm writing in class was atrocious.  


Anyway, the student has appealed my decision and has continued to submit ChatGPT-generated work (?????). He also did his final oral presentation on the dangers of AI in education (???????). I'm still waiting for our meeting with the appeals committee.

1cc6nff,63,2024-04-24,Deflection? Are We Always the Problem Now?,u/Avid-Reader-1984,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1cc6nff/deflection_are_we_always_the_problem_now/,"I'm going to paraphrase the response and my assignment:

Basically, in several literature courses, a good 20% of the class was using ChatGPT for everything, a good 60% of the students were rephrasing banal themes from lit cheat sites, and the rest were making an honest attempt with their own thoughts and responses.  
In ten years, this has been a radical change in how students approach my gen-ed literature course that is both accessible, and dare I say, fun-ish. Well, fun if you can enjoy reading, but I definitely find ways to update and create engagement points even for those less than thrilling nineteenth century selections. 

No matter what I did in class, I had limited engagement and limited responses, even from the twenty percent who seemed to be engaging the material. I'm not even kidding by stating that I don't think some of my students even know what my face looks like because they stared at the computer screen all semester (I have an electronics policy, but it was like yelling into a void; they literally could not stay away from their screens no matter how many points they lost). And yes, it was really awkward to have designed a hands-on group activity that required moving, but about 15% of the class would stay put and click away on their computers. I will say about the 20% who engaged me----wow, totally blown away by the work they did. I really needed those students this semester to even continue to accurately gauge my own reality (yes, see, I did instruct them in this; yes, I did review that; yes, some students appreciate and understand these activities).

So, at the end of the semester, I was done. Their last assignment was to tell me what they learned. Simple enough. As an introduction to the assignment, I noted the effort I put in to engage *them*. (I'm paraphrasing for brevity. It was not aggressive or pointed and was phrased as more like a, ""let's review what we did this semester,"" introduction to the instructions, but, if you're adept at reading you would understand that I was trying to emphasize just how much I did *for them*. Side note: a good way to get ahead of any accusations of ""but you didn't teach me that."")

I clicked on the assignment to read the first one, and I am floored, not by the way that the student turned their failure back on me, but the way they described it. The student went on at length about something that can be summarized as:

It would be easier to learn if so many professors did not lose their passion. They should be ashamed of the way they have failed the current generation. I think it's obvious that none of my professors care, and so I don't either. 

I have never worked harder in my career. I have never had to create so many engagement points in a course. Or spend so much time creating multiple ways to participate because a group of students can't hold a discussion, anymore. (And, sorry if this is you, but I don't think a successful discussion is the same four students participating all semester. Don't even get me started on calling on students.) Of course, I can't see myself from an outsider's perspective, but I don't think that I could have cared more. And I made that clear to them. And still...that was the response I received. 

This is gaslighting, right? Or, are we the reason that these students can't even bother with us, anymore? How many of you are just cashing that sweet professor pay for all that uncompensated work? :)",active,65
1ccc6nu,4,2024-04-24,[Ontario] Night school online and other online teachers: how do you evaluate?,u/uoftstudent97,CanadianTeachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadianTeachers/comments/1ccc6nu/ontario_night_school_online_and_other_online/,"Hey guys,

I'm just wondering for those teachers who teach night school or online, how do you evaluate?

I ask because I notice some students who are doing poorly in my class, and I speak to other teachers and they are doing just as poorly in those classes as well, yet they seem to be getting 80s and 90s in night school online courses.

Another thing is I'm teaching grade 12 university and the students who got their grade 11 university online are very weak, yet their marks were 80s and 90s.

These students must be cheating using ChatGPT (for courses requiring writing) or PhotoMath (for math courses) or any other online artificial intelligence to get their grades.

So, this leads me to ask, are teacher's just letting students cheat on evaluations and assignments because there is no way to know when it is online? Honestly, this is not fair, especially to students who work hard in non-online classes to actually earn their grade. It's so frustrating to me as a teacher because students know they can just take online night school and get an easy 80 or 90 so they can get into the program they want.

Just want the opinions of teachers who have been in the online night school game. Thanks guys.",active,3

As you chat with ChatGPT, you can ask it to remember something  specific or let it pick up details itself. ChatGPT’s memory will get  better the more you use it and you'll start to notice the improvements  over time. For example: 

* You’ve explained that you prefer  meeting notes to have headlines, bullets and action items summarized at  the bottom. ChatGPT remembers this and recaps meetings this way.
* You’ve  told ChatGPT you own a neighborhood coffee shop. When brainstorming  messaging for a social post celebrating a new location, ChatGPT knows  where to start. 
* You mention that you have a toddler and that  she loves jellyfish. When you ask ChatGPT to help create her birthday  card, it suggests a jellyfish wearing a party hat. 
* As a  kindergarten teacher with 25 students, you prefer 50-minute lessons with  follow-up activities. ChatGPT remembers this when helping you create  lesson plans.

How do you guys think it is implemented? I would imagine it does something like:

\- Recognizes certain prompts as ""memory instructions"" and decides to keep these as ""long term memories""

\- Uses Vectorized embeddings to store chunks of memory instructions into ""long term memories"".  
\- Keeps these ""memory"" instructions within the short-term context window by periodically re-inserting the instruction into the conversation when the context window length would be exceeded (i.e. when the model is close to ""forgetting"").

I am implementing an openai wrapper (with function calling support) and I currently use truncation / summarization to manage the context window. I am curious about integrating a pseudo-long term memory feature into my own code + periodically re-insert these ""memory instructions"" into recent conversation context, but as I only use Chat Completion streams, I would need a total refactor if embeddings were at play (and I also have heard that OpenAI embedding can be very expensive compared to local LLM embeddings which I also play around with).

Today I did an interesting experiment/learning opportunity with my students that you may want to try if you are like me and are losing your mind with how hard they are trying to push AI and curriculum reform based on this idiotic idea that ""if it is googleable, there is no point to students learning it."" What I'm seeing from education youtube is charlatan after charlatan basically saying human teachers may not be necessary in so few words.   


I teach biology and punnet squares for some unknown reason are very difficult for a lot of my students. It's a horrible thing to teach too because 7 kids will get it the first time I do it, and at least 7 kids will never get it no matter how long I sit and 1:1 work with them. This year I scaffolded it so well  (not bragging, this is just my 9th year painfully teaching this and this is my best product so far) that even my lowest students who actually do my process were masters, like top of the class in their understanding. Of course there are many kids who skip all of my color coding, graphic organizers, chunking, intentional sequencing of information etc and never get it because they assume they'll be able to pick it up, and can't, because these questions are essentially multi step word problems.  Anyway, I gave my honor's section a novel dihybrid punnet square question, which I had not taught them how to do in any prior class, and gave them 45 minutes to use ChatGPT to teach themselves how to solve this exact problem. They were  given a sheet of paper to create a graphic organizer or some type of tool that they could then use after the 45 minutes to answer a new dihybrid cross question with different traits. The thing about the dihybrid cross is that it looks scary and hard, but really once you know how to do a punnet square, they are easy.

I figured this activity would be a win win because students would either

 1. Realize they do need real teachers, school, education, to try because an internet they can't access or understand is useless in real life problem solving. 

2. Would learn how to use chatgpt to teach themselves novel concepts they have background information about. The way it is used for 90% of young people is copy question/paste question/copy response/past response. This could help me immensely because all of my classes are 30+, heavy sped and ELL, and a majority call me to their desk for every problem before they have even read the problem.

The students were extremely stressed over chat gpt. They didn't really understand what I meant by teach themselves and for several of them it appeared to be impossible after the first sentence of text, and they stopped trying. Really, no one understood what they were reading at first. I told them to experiment and ask the bot to ""simplify"" or to ""explain a different way"" or ""give me 3 more examples"" or ""explain with an analogy."" This helped, but a large number of them ended up resorting to using google. 

Results: 

Some really interesting learning moments came out of this activity. One girl forgot to add the word ""that"" from my prompt when she typed it into the chat box and it gave her something that was nearly unintelligible and taught them to do the problem completely wrong. It didn't even show a dihybrid cross. It was strange, because without the word ""that"", the question was still completely understandable. It took me a while to figure out what was going on with her. I felt bad for this student because she spent 25 minutes trying to understand something that made no sense. Also, several students had errors in the dihybrid cross that chatgpt gave them, which they found themselves which was really cool (indicating they learned the material). 

Sadly, google was just as bad. One student taught themselves from a dihybrid cross they found in google images that also had an error. However, about 4 kids taught themselves completely independent of me. This feels like a major win, because we hand hold to the point that I think most kids have confused the concept of a teacher helping you with giving you the answer word for word and kids merely copying what they hear. I really worry for a lot of my students because we give them a false sense of their learning with our grading system and support system, that will disappear very painfully from them if they choose to go to college. Most likely they will need to develop methods to help teach themselves outside of class hours. 

Anyway, I thought this was cool and it was fun. What I did do though, was tell them that they weren't going to be graded on right or wrong, but what I saw in their process between the two sheets. I figured this would make it fair since some of them were taught it wrong. ",User_deleted,11

However ChatGPT has taught me to work with my mind rather than against it. It's seriously underrated how good of a teaching tool ChatGPT is despite its flaws. 

Over the past year it has taught me how to cook, how to make yogurt, how to maintain a garden, how to clean the house with simple ingredients, how to program and probably it's best ability, to make examples of things and concepts with every day familiar things. Like how to program but using a car and a factory as an example. 

I know teachers and students use it now, but it seems mostly to create tests and for the students, answers to tests. I have cancelled many streaming services because I detest having to pay a monthly fee for anything, but I have never cancelled my premium subscription with ChatGPT.  It'll have to be brain dead like a zombie before I cancel at this point. 

Sorry for the rant, but I want to express at least once how much I enjoy thos program. ",active,57

USE IT!,u/auggee88,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1ceiyb1/ai_is_an_amazing_tool_to_make_your_dayslife/,"For a teacher, AI is amazing. It has freed up so much of my time that I am now able to complete all of my responsibilities, plus some, during the school day. No more taking home papers to grade, making lessons, etc, while my wife is all pissed because we have a 9 month old, and it falls on her. It has improved work and home life. I don't know why more teachers aren't using it. Students use it, so should we.

High School Soc. St. Teacher -- I have been using ChatGPT and Google Bard/Gemini for the last 1.5 years-ish. There's so many others, but these are the only two that I found that I've needed. I've created lessons, projects, assignments, readings, rubrics (this is the best because I hate making those fucking things), emails to co workers, emails to parents, revamped our schools graduation project and was put in charge of that with a raise :) , etc. 

I also experimented with grading a students written work with a rubric and then running it through chatgpt with the rubric, and it was only off from what I got, in the student's favor, by one or two points consistently. There's potential there.


P.S. to all those reading this: It's all about the prompts that you give it. You'll usually have to refine whatever it gives you with another prompt ""redo above but add/change........"" May seem annoying but something that used to take a half hour is now less than 5 mins. Also, pre-loading some styles/work/emails/lessons/whatever gives it a better idea and makes it seem more ""authentic."" 

Also ChatGPT is better quality IMO but only goes to 2022 I think, but Google Gemini is real time. Example: for my Current Events class after Oct 7th, I had it come up with a summary of events and a bulleted history of Israel/Palestine history that I printed out as an overview and history. ChatGPT wouldn't be able to give a current summary.",User_deleted,0
1ceywt6,1,2024-04-28,Should teachers be punished for using ChatGPT?,u/VillageCapital2415,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1ceywt6/should_teachers_be_punished_for_using_chatgpt/,"I am a senior in high-school (an academically competitive middle college high-school) and recently I have noticed my Economic teacher’s flagrant use of ChatGPT in nearly all of her assignments. We’ll call her Ms. Slater. Miss Slater is a young teacher, relatively new staff member at this school. As far as I know she is still completing her own education while working as a teacher and frequently mentions how she is expecting a pay raise after she is finished. Teachers at this school are paid more than the comprehensive high schools in the area and I believe most of them are outstanding teachers who deserve every penny. Normally I would not care very much about a teacher using AI but this particular teacher is a different story. A few weeks back, Ms Slater sent emails out to all students stating that she had found out that a number of students had been using AI to complete assignments, which she discovered after using a free online AI detector. The following day she went on a stern rant about how she was much too qualified to be dealing with such laziness, and announced that anyone found to have been using AI would be punished over the coming weeks. I thought this was fair since technically they weren’t doing the work themselves and shrugged it off. A few weeks pass and all of the students caught have been punished. I am unsure what exactly the punishment was but Im assuming they either received 0 on the assignment or perhaps had to complete extra work. Anyway as I am doing work I start to notice how wordy and systematic the instructions on her assignments are. There are needless sections with bullet points that just explain key points and learning objectives of the assignment. Words like “delve” or “additionally” used throughout. It was these patterns that reminded me of how ChatGPT usually responds, so I copied some of her words into the very same free online AI detector she claims to use and every time they were flagged as 90-100 percent AI generated. I’ve heard these detectors aren’t always accurate but they  were every flagged every time without fail. I was shocked that this teacher, who had so  passionately ranted against use of AI, uses it herself in nearly every one of her assignments! I can’t help but wonder if she should be held to the same standard that she holds her students to. You would think someone so outspoken would practice what they preach especially at such a respected academy. If she is using AI to do all the assignments, who’s to say she’s not using it for all her duties? Grading? Lesson planning? Why should the district be paying somebody to do so much when really ChatGPT has been behind it all? Personally I don’t think it’s a crime for teachers to use it now and then, but for everything? It just feels wrong that this teacher has “rules for thee but not for me” in her class and I wonder if anything should be done. ",User_deleted,0

AI systems trained on human-generated data, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), often perform below or around human level due to their lack of search, planning, and reasoning capabilities. Despite being trained with 200,000 years of reading material, these models are still considered ""pretty dumb"". However, their value lies in their vast knowledge and language fluency [1]. Yann LeCun, a prominent figure in the AI field, emphasizes the importance of AI systems learning from high-bandwidth sensory inputs like vision, not just text [2]. He also addressed AI doomers in a speech at the Davos summit, where he discussed artificial intelligence with other industry leaders [3].







LeCun also made an interesting comparison between the human genome and AI models. He pointed out that the entire human genome, which is 3 billion base pairs, is equivalent to 6 gigabits or 800 megabytes. Only a small portion of the genome codes for the brain, and an even smaller portion differentiates humans from chimps, which is less than 10 megabytes. In contrast, even a small language model like Llama-3 7B requires 14 gigabytes of storage [4].







In other news, Groq Inc recently hosted a fireside chat between their CEO & Founder, Jonathan Ross, and CEO of Social Capital, Chamath Palihapitiya, at the RAISE Summit in Paris. The chat covered cutting-edge topics and is available for viewing on YouTube [5]. Groq Inc has also introduced Dark Mode as a user setting on GroqChat and Console, allowing users to choose their preferred setting or match it with their system [6].







Finally, NVIDIA's developer training programs are helping university instructors train researchers and students on using GPU-accelerated servers and integrating generative AI into the classroom. These on-demand sessions can be accessed through the GTC24 playlist on NVIDIA's website [7].

After a bad trip I had (you know the kind) about three years ago, I've been curious about spacetime in general but in a ""bro science"" kind of way. I asked ChatGPT what it thought about a theory I'd been developing which explores a different take on the block universe theory. I then asked it to write a short essay to better explain this theory. It took some back and forth and asking ChatGPT to critique itself, then rewrite the essay based on those critiques. It still had issues with repetition, so I asked it to summarize the essay it had written, then forget all other versions of the essay and rewrite it from scratch based on its own summary and below is what it came up with, albeit shorter than previous versions. I kept a title from an earlier version since I liked it better but I made sure to make no other edits of my own, making revisions only by asking ChatGPT to do so itself. Thought this was a fun experiment on how ChatGPT could help someone with formal education of a subject form new ideas and communicate them. 

  
**Title: The Lichtenberg Universe: Dynamic Realities and the Nature of Time**

**Introduction**  
Traditional views of the universe often present time as a linear progression within a static four-dimensional spacetime continuum. This perspective, known as the block universe theory, posits that all moments—past, present, and future—exist simultaneously but are experienced sequentially. Challenging this static model, the Lichtenberg Universe theory introduces a dynamic element that transforms our understanding of time and reality. This theory suggests that a branching, dynamic energy, similar to the patterns seen in Lichtenberg figures created by electrical discharges, actively traverses and reshapes the spacetime block, irreversibly activating and altering its realities.

**The Lichtenberg Universe Theory**  
In the Lichtenberg Universe model, spacetime is not merely a backdrop for events but a canvas of latent potentialities awaiting activation. This dynamic energy does not follow pre-established paths but creates its own, similar to the unpredictable branching in Lichtenberg figures. As it moves through the spacetime continuum, this energy selects which realities to activate, consuming their specific conditions in the process. Once a path is activated, it is permanently altered—its original state is forever changed, rendering its previous potentialities inaccessible. This irreversible process represents the forward flow of time as experienced from our human perspective.

**Implications for Time and Reality**  
The introduction of dynamic energy to the block universe theory profoundly impacts our understanding of time and reality. Time is no longer a static dimension through which events unfold predictably but is an active, molding force that dictates the unfolding of events based on the paths chosen by this dynamic energy. This view challenges the notion of determinism, suggesting that while all potential outcomes exist, only those realized by the energy's passage truly come to fruition. Philosophically, this raises questions about the nature of unactivated realities—do they possess any form of existence if they are never realized? Moreover, this theory suggests that our conventional understanding of time as linear and unidirectional is merely a human interpretation of how this energy interacts with the spacetime continuum.

**Conclusion**  
The Lichtenberg Universe model offers a revolutionary perspective on the cosmos, illustrating the universe not as a pre-determined series of events laid out in spacetime but as a dynamic entity continually shaped by the energetic paths that forge, activate, and transform its realities. This theory enriches our understanding of the universe's structure, compelling us to reconsider fundamental aspects of time, space, and existence. By viewing time and reality through the lens of dynamic energy, we gain a deeper appreciation for the complexity and ever-evolving nature of the cosmos.",User_deleted,0
