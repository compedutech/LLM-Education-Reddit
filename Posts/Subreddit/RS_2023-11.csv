17l6a40,12,2023-11-01,$30K Revenue (9 Months): From Nothing to Launching Courses in a Day Now [Full Guide],u/ShellOfNutshell,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/17l6a40/30k_revenue_9_months_from_nothing_to_launching/,"I started creating courses in January, 2023. I had no experience prior to this creating online courses. Over the last 9 months, this has been a stable **$2k / month** for me and I want talk about my story and how I did it. Firstly, Revenue screenshot: [https://imgur.com/a/zraqWND](https://imgur.com/a/zraqWND) \- October revenue is still unaccounted for - but it's going to be **3k based on enrolments and previous trends**.

# My courses & Time taken

My first course - It was a disaster. Recorded with a laptop microphone, the 2 hour course was on a trending AI Topic, died in 2 months. Took me **3 weeks to build it**.

My second course - Master Generative AI (Extension of previous course but taught everything in AI), took me **4 weeks to build**, makes me the most amount of money, and has a lot of students

My Third course - Prompt Engineering - took me **2 weeks to build**, a lot of students, but dying after 3 months

My Fourth course - AI & SEO (recently launched) - picking up slowly, took me **2 weeks to build**

My Fifth and 6th courses are on AI Product Management & Digital Marketing and were **built in less than a week.** 

I'm launching another course in November **within a week.**

[My Profile on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/user/feelix-2/)

&#x200B;

**Notice how i went from 3 weeks to 4 days for launching courses.**

Firstly, i'm a hard believer of launching MVP and iterating over time. I don't spend all my energy building perfect courses, I build a bare bone MVP and keep adding content.

&#x200B;

# How do you get to 1 course a week, provided you decide to do this full time?

**A course has 6 stages of creation:**

\- **Ideation** \- what you want to build, mostly go with your passion and the knowledge you have curve is shorter - 10%

\- **Research** \- What kind of courses exist, which ones are top rated and why - 20%

\- **Creation** \- Recording content and creating videos / assignments / notes / cover images / texts - 35%

\- **Editing** **Content** \- 30%

\- **Initial** **launch** \- 5%

(% indicates how long each step took me initially)

&#x200B;

# Break-down of each of these steps:

\- **Ideation** \- you figure out what kind of course you want to build, this one is relatively easy but super important. You need to choose a niche that is less competitive (AI SEO is one such niche) but has decent audience for making money. It could be a electric guitar, setting up a grocery shop, so on. As long as it's not competitive, do it

&#x200B;

\- **Research** \- Once you figure what you want to build, start looking at a couple of places for inspiration and understand whether the market exists for this type of content. This could be just looking at the course marketplace to see other courses exist, Reddit posts, blogs, Groups and so on, as long as there are people looking for it, you bet you can make money

&#x200B;

\- **Creation** \- this is what takes a lot of my time. I'm going to show you how i significantly reduced my time in here.

* Curriculum - research other courses / starting from scratch is not ideal because other courses already have invested time to refine the curriculum so makes sense to use that as a starting point
   * **How to automate: Use the best rated course and use** [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) **to generate a similar course structure, add notes on additional lectures example - i teach about ""BLUE"" electric guitars, it takes almost no time to get to starting point**
* Script + Slides creation - Once you have curriculum, putting together script can be a nightmare, but this is essential. instead of building an entire script, put down bullet notes.
   * **Use ChatGPT to take each chapter and then create bullet notes to talk about - copy these notes in a doc to refer later**
   * **Leverage these bullets to create slides on Canva - takes 1 min per slide - so 40 minutes overall for a 40 Page PPT** 
* Cover Image / Description - All of this optimized content can created using ChatGPT - invest very little time here, but ensure you have keywords optimised in the course
* Course recording - This it the major heavy-lifting but you will have to do this. **I use** [**OBS**](https://obsproject.com/) **to record content, it's free and open source and gets the job done, initial learning curve is 15 minutes**

THIS is by far my most time taking part, initially, it was the editing but i automated it, let me show you how.

&#x200B;

\- **Editing -**  I'm proud to have automated this bit. But let me talk about the initial struggle first:

* Basic Edits
   * Initially I used Primere Pro to edit my videos. This step took a lot of time, even more than creating that video, because in order to make course video optimised, I would trim silent parts, which would be a night mare. 
   * Now I'm leveraging AI tools like [Snapy](https://snapy.ai) to auto edit using their video silence remover feature. It's a boon. 
   * It may come as a surprise but I spend no time editing my video. It's all ready within a few minutes. The only effort is uploading it.

\- **Initial Launch** \- Takes me literally an 30 mins to launch my course. I publish it on Marketplaces like Udemy, they take care of all the marketing, while I keep creating courses. Most of the revenue is market place based, you get 100% of the revenue coming from your own marketing links. They take a cut for their marketing based revenue.

&#x200B;

# How much time each step takes me now for a 4 hour course:

**Ideation** \- 1 hour

**Research** \- 1-2 Hours

**Creation** \- 7-8 Hours (varies on course length)

**Editing** \- 1 Hour

**Initial Launch** \- 30 minutes

I don't know who will benefit from this. But I hope I can help someone who is looking to productise their knowledge. All the best!

17lghvs,6,2023-11-01,AITA for wanting my friend to have a harsher punishment for not contributing to team project,u/SneakySquirrel547,AITAH,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/17lghvs/aita_for_wanting_my_friend_to_have_a_harsher/,"So I am a Senior in college right now along with my friend who I've known for about 5 years now.  We are both taking computer science courses and are both in the same 'senior project' course in which students form a team and create a software project.  Obviously, as friends, we formed a group together with me being the team leader (I asked if she was fine with this and she said it was).  I had no issues with her before this.  However, a day after everyone got into their groups, I immediately regretted forming a group with her.  I was discussing with her my plan for the project and making sure she was okay with it.  She mentioned how she was fine with my idea, but warned me and said ""you'll have to program, too, cause I can't do all the work.""  At first I thought she was joking but she wasn't.  That really set me off since nobody has even gotten to starting on the project since it was the very first day, but I reacted calmly and just carried on.  Well, it kept getting worse.

The first week was arguably the easiest.  The task was simple: sign a group agreement form to do our work on time, etc.  The form is already written by the teacher and just needs everyone's signatures.  As the team leader, I am tasked with turning in this work as well as everything else (minus the code cause everyone individually turns that in).  I signed the agreement form and sent it to her online so she could sign it and send it back to me to turn in.  After sending it to her asking for her signature, she wanted me to forge her signature so I could turn it in (I waited a few days for her to actually respond back to my message about the form, and now it was due that night).  Again, I was upset at this as it seemed like such a simple damn task.  I stood firm and said ""no, I can't do all of the work!"" as both in a lighthearted way but mainly serious.  Eventually, she signed it and sent it back to me so I could turn it in a few hours before the due date.

The next week we had to make a description of what we wanted our project to do and why.  I filled out my part and shared a Google doc with her so she could put in her stuff.  She then put in her description of the project and then told me she used ChatGPT to fill it out because she ""didn't know what to write.""  I was very pissed off at this point and told her to rewrite it in her own words saying I didn't want to use ChatGPT as everyone in the class and the teacher has access to all of our work and might be able to tell it was written by an AI.  She rewrote it and I double checked that she did by throwing in the new text in an AI identifier (the original one came back around 80% AI written and the new one was only around 20% so I was satisfied with that).

Next assignment comes around and is basically where everyone makes these design documents for our project.  I asked her to help out with it and she said she would, but then never did.  I messaged her multiple times through Discord and text receiving no response until a few days after the due date.  Her excuse was her computer wasn't working and her internet was bad.  I knew this was bs cause she streams for her fans online and I can see that she was doing that while I was waiting on her to help for several days.  So I had to complete everything myself and turn it in on time the day it was due.

She continues not contributing to the project at each turn.  The next assignment was to post some ideas on what to implement in the project that a potential user would want in it.  I asked for her help and she did not turn in anything.  The teacher wanted every group to have at least 10 written down.  So I had to write all 10 cause I didn't want my project to get points deducted.

By then I was extremely pissed off and frustrated as hell.  I reached a breaking point and emailed the teacher explaining everything, but leaving out the part about how she used ChatGPT cause I didn't want her to be suspended or anything.  I just wanted her to be taken out of the project as a whole and let me do it on my own cause I work better alone.  He emailed back saying he would speak with her and if things didn't improve would do something else.

Next phase is the actual programming part.  Luckily, I guess his talk with her worked cause she wrote up the first part of the project.  I was happy about that and hoped it would get better....it didn't.  I asked her to put in different things in the project while I put in others.  She only coded one more thing in this span of 3 weeks for this phase.

At the end of this phase, everyone is supposed to present what they have done so far and give a 'demo' of the project running.  The demo was about 5 days away at the time and so I messaged her asking if she could put in her code and even mentioned exactly what lines I wanted the code on to help her know what I needed.  She ignored me for a whole day and messaged back saying she will get on it.  

A few days pass and nothing.  I message her again (2 days before the demo due date now), asking about it.  She submitted some code but it wasn't what I asked for...at all.  It wasn't even in the file we were working on.  I told her this and she didn't respond (keep in mind, she is posting for her fans online during all this so I know she sees it).

The day it's due, an hour before class starts, she messages she put in the correct code.  I checked it and it's still not right.  Has errors, etc.  I told her and at this point was just completely done.  30 minutes before we are supposed to present I just decided to code it myself so we could have what we needed.  I got it done and we presented our demo.

I decide to talk to the teacher after class alone about the situation and explain everything that's happened since the emails (again, I don't mention ChatGPT).  He tells me that if he took her out of the group now then she would ""be thrown under the bus and wouldn't pass the class and would have to retake it.""  He told me he thought the best thing to do is to keep her in the group and told me to give her things to do that don't have a severe impact on the project completion (he offered ideas like researching things, etc.).  He also said he agreed with me, though, and assured me the grade I get will not be the same as hers and that she will probably receive a bad one. This is where I'm asking whether or not IATA because I just don't like how she is still going to be in the project and pass still without helping hardly at all.  Like yeah she will pass with a bad grade, but I feel like that's too generous.  I don't want her to be attached to the project at all and essentially leech off of me to barely pass.  I just don't feel like it's very fair."
17lghxs,1,2023-11-01,Sharing a Plus account (family use case),u/wolfynn,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/17lghxs/sharing_a_plus_account_family_use_case/,"Hello folks!  
Though with different needs we are three people at home (family binded) that would use the ChatGPT Plus service to “work"" with it.

One for student needs, other for research & professional texts, last one to help with language learning.

Not usually at the same time, and not with a really continuous and intense use.

So… my questions are:  
• is it admissible to share an account, is it limited to different devices or IPs, or just to the number of “queries” per hour?

• have you experienced this kind of scenario, and which do you think are the pros/cons vs. paying several accounts or combining with the free 3.5 chat?

As I say, it’s not a continuous use for any of us three, but we would like to use the Plus version to start trying “the good stuff” and trust each other not to delete or mess with our chats or so (by now).

Thank you all in advance!!

17ms10m,4,2023-11-03,I'm a noob and I'm confused. Excel table to Anki cards,u/AntonyGud07,Anki,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anki/comments/17ms10m/im_a_noob_and_im_confused_excel_table_to_anki/,"I come from quizzlet. I have A LOT of quizzlet lists and I'd like to make the transition to Anki.

I get it, Anki is powerful and all... but definitely not as user friendly as quizzlet IMO. 

All my list are stored in excel spreadsheets and are sorted in tabs.

I want to import those tabs on anki.

(i'm learning japanese)

the excel tabs looks like this :

A:A the kanji

B:B Onyomi

C:C Kunyomi

D:D translation.

I was thinking that I could just copy paste the list but either on the desktop app or the web extension I just can't find anything, the app only allows me to create card by card or to import csv files. csv is an option but I don't want to spend 4 hours converting my 100+ excel files.

sorry for comparing with an other app but, on quizzlet I could just copy paste my excel tabs on a text area and it would auto detect the cards I want to create, is there a similar feature on Anki ? or by using chatGPT to create a similar algorithm for card creation ?

Sorry again for my silly request, I'm trying my best to learn Anki to take a further steps in my learning and maybe in the future by sharing decks with my students.

If you have any tips to convert quizzlet list to anki list I would be very happy to learn how to do it.

thank you in advance for your answer,

hope I will be an Anki pro soon !

17myacu,1,2023-11-03,What type of MBA for doctorate student,u/theobrominepoisoning,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/17myacu/what_type_of_mba_for_doctorate_student/,"Hi!

TL;DR: Doctorate student in nutritional Science with previous biomedical project management experience considering an MBA for a career shift into management. Seeking advice on affordable, reputable (online) MBAs that offer flexibility during/post-PhD. 

Long version:

I've been screening the other posts but maybe you can give me some more advice..

I am a biomedical scientist that is currently doing nutritional studies and I plan to get my doctorate in approx. 2 years max. I have some work experience (both governmental and pharma), mostly in project management/ project lead. I am passionate for science but fed up with research, given the ridiculously bad working conditions. At the same time, I have a business driven mindset and I see my future self either in a (corporate) management position or some current start-up ideas will end up being successful. I'd be happy to benefit my biomedical background in some future management positions.

I am 30 years old and I am not fully sure whether I would really want to spend another 1- 2 years on a full time MBA program after receiving my PhD, but I would definitely consider that as an option if career prospects are much better (based on my readings: pro: better network and much more financially attractive positions, con: time and costs) and if it was not overly expensive. 

I see an MBA as a toolkit and I might not need the full skillset of a traditional MBA. 

 ChatGPT gives me a bunch MBA options

Full-Time MBA
Part-Time MBA
Executive MBA (EMBA)
Online MBA
Global MBA
Accelerated MBA
Professional MBA (PMBA)


I want to learn the necessary skills and I believe that I have already a network of people that might have some suitable job offers. 

Do you have any suggestions? Maybe some affordable but internationally acknowledged online program would already improve my career prospects? 

Thanks in advance!"

17od3qe,1106,2023-11-05,Guide to the mythical viral coefficient. Modern examples + how it grew my business to $450k ARR.,u/Toxic-Headshott,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/17od3qe/guide_to_the_mythical_viral_coefficient_modern/,"**Note**: Been lurking on this sub and reddit in general for quite some time but I felt like this would be a valuable post for both people in the ideation and product stage. I wish someone told me these things when I started out. With that being said, some of this content might be a refresher for some of you, but hopefully I can shine light on some use cases that are still helpful. Also this is not to say I’m some big shot making $450k ARR, but I think there are lessons here. This post is for anyone who is in B2B or B2C that has an online presence. The focus is on software because that’s what I know, but this could be done with services or other verticals as well.  
  
The viral coefficient is a concept I’ve been interested in ever since I read the infamous Viral Loop book by Adam Penenberg back in 2009. A viral coefficient is just how many new customers an existing customer brings in on average. If you have a sustained viral coefficient of 2, then each customer brings 2 new customers and you spread organically. It’s how Facebook, PayPal, Email services, ChatGPT, etc. all grew. It would be wrong to limit this in scope to just B2C products. It can happen with B2B where you ask clients for referrals and word begins to spread about your product. There’s also more subtle ways of doing it just like how typeform did. If you’re doing anything in the digital space this is crucial to think about.   
To put it more succinctly: make something others love so much they tell their friends. Let’s walk through some examples and then explore specific takeaways.   
  
**Past Examples of Viral loops:**

  
**PayPal:** Paypal had a particularly interesting viral strategy. It started off as just sending money over the Internet to another person with a focus on the Ebay niche. If a new person signed up, they would get $5. Of course this incentive was unsustainable as they would have burned all their VC money, but it helped initiate the process. 

  
**Facebook:** Perhaps the most notorious example of a viral coefficient. Like PayPal, they started in a niche, which we all know was Harvard. It naturally played on people’s curiosity. If someone was posting about you or someone you knew, you wanted to sign up and see what was going on. Eventually they started opening access up to other universities before finally giving access to everyone. At that point, it completely blew up. 

  
**HotMail:** Hotmail utilized a pretty effective viral marketing strategy by including a tagline at the end of every email sent by its users that read ""Get your free email at Hotmail."" This basically turned every email sent into a potential Hotmail sign-up. By leveraging the network effects where users were communicating with non-users, Hotmail rapidly increased its user base. It started to spread like wildfire because each user inadvertently advertised Hotmail every time they sent an email. This signature line was so influential that despite the negligible cost of including it, it propelled Hotmail to amass millions of users within an extremely short period after its launch.  
  
**Uber:** This is the platform that I took the most inspiration from. Their viral growth strategy is probably most applicable to people here because it was multifaceted: word-of-mouth, referral incentives, strategic marketing campaigns, etc.. In its early days, Uber incentivized both its drivers and riders to share their referral codes with others by offering ride credit or a bonus payout. For riders, there was the appeal of a free or discounted ride for signing up through a friend's referral link was a strong incentive to try the service. And for drivers, the promise of extra earnings for referring new drivers played a big role in expanding the workforce quickly. Additionally, Uber capitalized on the exclusivity and luxury of its initial ""black car"" service to create hype in the markets it entered. The strategy was to create a prestigious image and then open the platform to a wider audience with more economical options like UberX, allowing it to scale up rapidly.  


  
**A viral loop in the making - a 2023 example**

  
**Example:** If this hasn’t started already, then most of the emails you receive are about to have another email CCd: m@mindy.com. This is an AI agent that was built by a cofounder of Paypal / first employee of YouTube, the third employee of YouTube, and an MD from Accenture. For the sake of not revealing too much and focusing on the product, just email it and see what it can do if you’re curious and you’ll see why I’m saying this. They’ve set up a system where onboarding another user is as simple as CCing the AI into the email and it will start interacting and performing autonomous tasks for you.   
  
**The takeaway:** If this works out, then it will spread faster than anyone can possibly imagine and may be the defining viral loop of the next year and possibly years to come. The reason? It’s easy to sign up and there’s a direct incentive to CC the AI to someone you’re emailing. It can go and help you solve problems you’re working on. Whether that’s parsing through a 60+ page document, researching an esoteric scientific tolic, or scheduling meetings for teachers and students. This is what’s important to remember: make it as easy as possible for customers to get you customers and when designing your product keep this principle in mind. If connecting someone to the existing product makes it better for you then you’ll have something that can blow up. The tricky part is creating something that has virality already built in, so for those of you not in the ideation phase, I feel you because that’s me.  
  
**My own company - a contrived but functioning viral coefficient**

  
**Example:** Not every product can have a viral coefficient like Mindy, that’s partially because they built it with that in mind. If you’re like me and already have a product, there are still things you can do in order to incentivize folks to use your product.   
For context in my own company (which I will not link to here for the sake of following the subreddit’s rules - if you want proof feel free to DM me), I bootstrapped one of those AI photo generators that was really popular in 2022 / part of 2023. I used stabilitiy’s stable diffusion image model + google’s dream booth to generate photorealistic and artistic images of user’s faces to show their friends. It never blew up in the same way Lensa/Remini did, but what I did was lock utility behind closed doors. More specifically, I locked certain photos users could generate behind closed doors. If they wanted to generate those particular types of photos, they’d have to do a social media post about the product and their results. This meant all their friends saw an image of themselves generated. Since their friends are the ones who know how they look, they were naturally interested to see how they themselves looked. Whenever someone with a big following would post this out, I would see a surge in traffic to the site.  
  
**My Takeaway**: While I didn’t have a viral coefficient of 1.0 and have since had lower growth numbers (partially due to comodization/market saturation), I found a way to get my product to market itself. Other than a few influencer ad campaigns, most of my growth was organic inbound. You can create incentives by giving users access to more features through a referral program. Of course, my example is specific to my company but I think there’s a lot of ways this can be done for many different companies. Including B2B. I ran a SaaS in the past (was acquired) and offered a really large client access to early features to give them a competitive edge in return for 10 warm introductions to other clients. If any of you want help brainstorming on your product, I’m happy to help in the comments. To build a viral product: start in a niche, make something people love so much they tell their friends, make the onboarding process simple (e.g. free to use), and most importantly create a product that incentivizes other folks to use it. If you didn’t build your product with a viral coefficient in mind, then creating a false sense of scarcity by locking certain product features behind a referral program or in the B2B case (asking for referrals to other clients) won’t get you to a VC of 1.0 but it will still help you get organic inbound. I’m hoping to take my learnings here and make my next product have a viral coefficient above 1.0. "

17othid,655,2023-11-05,I trick my students to teach them a lesson,u/Embarrassed-Fix-2880,TrueOffMyChest,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/17othid/i_trick_my_students_to_teach_them_a_lesson/,"I (37 M) just got a warning from my university (not saying the name) and decided to just vent and get this off my chest. 

Almost every semester, I will notice that there are quite a few cheaters in my class. Now I teach a sort of English class and a lot of students that take my class need it as a prerequisite. I have a 4.3 on rate my professor with over 52 reviews and I believe (obviously biased) that I teach well and interactively. I bring in tons of snacks and leave them at the front of the lecture hall and also sometimes bring in baby piglets before an exam for students to hold since my wife works at a wildlife sanctuary. I always curve up to allow students with Bs to have the chance to get an A but unfortunately there will always be cheaters in classes. 

Because we use canvas, I can check to see who opens the resources and who doesn't even read the module. I also use that with a combination of AI detection tools and Turnitin plagiarism detector. Every semester I get about 2-3 students (AT LEAST) who decide to plagiarize work. They will often plagiarize without using just ChatGPT but just straight from other websites. Now, even after plagiarism, I could excuse these actions but these students never attend the lectures except for an exam and so I know they are plagiarizing everything without even attempting to learn. 

Now what I've started doing is letting them think that they are getting perfect scores on every assignment and let them think that they are soaring through the class. I notice that when I give them good scores, they start to hide the cheating less and less and the lack of effort is so much more noticeable. So when the semester ends and the last class is over, I submit a plagiarism report for each individual student to the dean and substract 50% of their grade on every single plagiarized piece of work (all of them) which fails them and puts them at around 55%. I love to see their panicked emails at the end of the semester as they ask me how they can make it up and apologize. Don't cheat kiddos. "

\#A Society Transformed: The First Year of ChatGPT - by GPT-4

\### The Launch: A New Dawn

In November 2022, the digital universe buzzed with the debut of ChatGPT, a sophisticated AI developed by OpenAI. Its introduction marked a significant leap forward in natural language processing (NLP). Unlike its predecessors, ChatGPT wasn't just a question-answering machine; it was designed to converse, to understand the ebb and flow of human dialogue.

This AI was built on a foundation laid by revolutionary transformer models, but what set it apart was its fine-tuning, which was accomplished through a method called Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). By incorporating nuances from human interactions, ChatGPT could provide responses that felt incredibly humanlike, not just in accuracy but in tone and style.

The release wasn't just about technological prowess; it was a carefully crafted user experience. OpenAI provided a user-friendly interface that allowed anyone with internet access to converse with ChatGPT.

My English and Speech teacher(12th grade) keeps talking to us about how she uses AI, and has been encouraging us to do the same. She says there's ""no point reinventing the wheel"" and regularly uses it for our rubrics and assignments, and she's been showing us how to use it to write scripts for our speeches too. 

It makes me really uncomfortable! She says we shouldn't use it on essays without double-checking and inputting as much information as possible, but has praised ChatGPT a lot. Personally I'm totally against using AI for any type of schoolwork or creative work like writing, and it worries me that she thinks this way especially when my Speech class is a ccp class, meaning she teaches it for a college credit. This wouldn't be allowed in college, right?

None of my other classes even come CLOSE to telling us anything good about AI. One kid in my Botany class(another ccp one) got kicked out for using it on his essay. So I guess I'm wondering, can I do anything about this? Like is this allowed?? 

I sort of want to tell someone higher-up. We're doing a group speech assignment and it's sort of draining to be the only one writing my own speech, while everyone else in my group uses AI. But she's best friends with the principals and makes them home-made meals every day in her classroom, so I don't even know who I'd tell. And maybe this is all trivial? Like, does this venture into personal opinion territory? I don't want to be an asshole, but I just really sort of hate this. 

Idk, please let me know if there's something I can do, or if this is something I'll just have to put aside. It feels irresponsible for her to be encouraging this in students. We're all in high-school and she teaches grades 10-12. Tbh I've been creeped out by some of her other actions so I could see this being a thing where I just don't like her and am nitpicking?"

2. **Roleplay Genius**: ChatGPT's like an RPG character, except for real-life tasks. Need a mechanic? Done. Financial advice? You got it. Coding? Part of the job. I integrate it into my daily workflow, especially for coding stuff.
3. **Email Delegation**: This is the real game-changer.  I’ve established a thread that contains all my current project tasks, the names of our development team members, and both immediate and long-term goals for our app’s completion. I keep this thread active and direct team emails to ChatGPT, requesting it to draft responses. And just like that – I have an AI secretary at my service. If it encounters a problem or requires my input, it succinctly summarizes the issue and seeks my approval before sending anything out.

Anybody else using it in a similar manner?"

**Tips for Maximizing ChatGPT for Education and Work: A Reddit Guide**

Along with some of the most amazing features, I've also used ChatGPT for mundane tasks. It has been a game-changer for both incredible and everyday tasks. I've organized my conversations into different threads for various needs.

1. **Academic Hustle**: I'm diving back into the student life with a Cyber Security degree at WGU. I've set up a ChatGPT thread that's like my personal scholarship assistant. I fed it my resume, some press releases, and a spiel about my startup goals. Now, I just drop in scholarship questions, and it crafts responses based on the info I've given. Super handy!

I learned C+ programming out of a book. If you’re relying on a brand new, beta phase tool to keep up, you aren’t skilled or don’t care and should consider a new degree. Chatgpt and others like it should be a useful tool to help you, not a reliance."

And so far, it has helped me with a lot of assignments, understanding, and more, but I can't really rely on it for accuracy. I want to use ChatGPT to also help explain concepts (including quantitative concepts), which GPT3.5 is apparently not so good at, and was considering getting GPT plus.  I also do use it for a million other things in the educational field, which I think GPT plus would help in."

17rdgiu,5,2023-11-09,Has There Been Any Research on Curriculum Learning for Pre-training or Fine-Tuning Large Language Models?,u/IndividualAd1648,LocalLLaMA,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/17rdgiu/has_there_been_any_research_on_curriculum/,"Hey new to this world since chatgpt, I've been thinking about the training process for large language models and have a question for the community regarding the structure of datasets used in pre-training and fine-tuning phases.

My understanding is that these models are exposed to a diverse and randomized array of data. Each datum is adjusted to fit a certain context length, ensuring that the model learns from the content itself rather than the order in which it's presented. However, I'm curious if there has been any research or experimentation with structuring these datasets to follow a curriculum learning approach.

In traditional education, students progress from simple to complex concepts, building upon what they've learned as they advance. Could a similar approach benefit AI training? For instance, starting with simpler language constructs and concepts before gradually introducing more complex and abstract ones?

The idea would be to categorize training data by complexity, then batch it so that the model first learns from 'easier' data, with the complexity scaling up as training progresses. Randomization could still occur within these batches to prevent memorization of sequence rather than understanding.

I'm interested in any insights or references to research that has explored this idea. Does curriculum learning improve the efficacy of language models? Could it lead to more nuanced understanding and better performance in complex tasks?"
17rg006,7,2023-11-09,Is “showing your prompts” the future equivalent of “showing your work” in homework?,u/copyleaksai,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/17rg006/is_showing_your_prompts_the_future_equivalent_of/,"Calculators came out, and the knee-jerk reaction was to ban students from using them, but let’s be real: how can you ban something students can access on their phones and personal computers at home? And just like the calculator, ChatGPT is available everywhere, and soon, it’ll be seamlessly integrated into other software such as word processors and spreadsheets. In the case of calculators, to make it equitable in the classroom, they moved to our current state of education - show your work. Academia determined students could get help from calculators but needed to ensure they understood how they got there. 

So, what is the equivalent of showing your work for AI? 

The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in education is only increasing. Tools like ChatGPT and other genAI text producers allow students to generate homework answers quickly, raising the question of plagiarism and whether students truly understand the material if they use AI to assist them.

**I believe the solution is to require students to cite the prompts used to generate AI content.** 

Requiring students to cite their prompts could be the magical equivalent of ‘showing your work’- revealing the process behind their final product. Teachers can better assess real student learning by evaluating the prompts and the AI output.  

I have already talked with a few teachers utilizing this method in their classrooms. One science teacher required prompt disclosure if GenAI was used to assist in essay drafting, allowing their students to use ChatGPT for research and idea generation but not full essay assistance.  This example illustrates that requiring prompt transparency, rather than prohibiting AI altogether, brings about meaningful integration of AI in the classroom. Students can leverage these tools to deepen skills, while teachers can confirm alignment with learning objectives.

&#x200B;

[This is just one way you could handle prompt disclosure - we need to approach AI with a lens of scrutiny versus closing the door immediately and disallowing these platforms across the board.](https://preview.redd.it/8sjysnc8gczb1.png?width=1806&format=png&auto=webp&s=d27fa05dcb21e7d1eaa6ac4e6b68f175326b334c)

\[**Prompt used in Claude:** *read this blog post and write a finalized statement that summarizes the ideas and is interesting to read. Output then edited by author for originality and clarity.*\]

AI holds enormous potential to make learning more personal, engaging, and accessible. With the ability to adapt to individual students' strengths and weaknesses, AI tutors can provide customized support to improve comprehension and retention. By processing large volumes of data, AI systems can also uncover insights to enhance curriculum and instruction. As schools implement these technologies, maintaining transparency is crucial among students and teachers to build trust and realize the full benefits.

We can uphold academic values even as AI plays a more prominent role by requiring students to effectively ""show their work"" through prompt disclosure. Students should be able to explain in their own words how they arrived at an answer, regardless of whether they received help from an AI tutor. Teachers must be empowered to determine if understanding was truly gained versus answers copied without comprehension. Fostering this transparency will be key.

AI should enhance education, not replace true student understanding. With thoughtful implementation and ongoing oversight, AI can make learning more personal, engaging, and accessible for all. But human connection, critical thinking skills, and the ability to explain ideas are irreplaceable. By keeping students at the center and AI as a tool to support them, we can realize the benefits while upholding the values at the heart of education."

The goal is to lead the student to understanding by asking questions they should know the answer too rather than just giving the answer, hence ""Socratic"". I knew physics, but ChatGPT should be able to tutor you in more than that. So let me know if it works well for you! Link below

As for my background, I have recently started learning ML and PyTorch and practicing CP.

I want to know if it will be advisable if I remain focused only on AI/ML part of tech or should I also build upon other tech domains like WebDev/Cybersecurity/Blockchain?

And what is the best way to study and master AI/ML. I have a course on Python (includes intro to ML) but just watching and getting to know the stuff (python libraries) seems useless to me, how do I do something where I can also find the application of what I study. 

With the incoming of ChatGPT, it is even easier to overcome the syntax barrier.

When I went to kaggle (beginner competitions), the 2-3 competitions that I saw had to use some pretrained models to make predictions, is it all that there is to ML, learning how to fit data and getting the required predictions with the right model?But now all of it easy after I participated in 2 of these competitions(the Titanic one and one related to Time Series Forecasting). 

Can anyone suggest how I can expand my horizon? I am sure that there must be more to it than I currently know of, I am interested in learning more about advanced topics like NLP, Reinforcement learning, etc. I'd be glad if someone can expand upon it.

I want to do something worthwhile but I don't know the direction I should head to.

Having valuable skills is what I expect of myself before graduating. Please can someone guide me?"
17s6zye,1,2023-11-10,Is AI being used by your school (not just students)? I can’t keep up with all of this.,u/Toxic-Headshott,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/17s6zye/is_ai_being_used_by_your_school_not_just_students/,"I’ve been a teacher for about \~4 years now teaching AP chem / regular chem classes at a public high school. Like many of you here, I’ve been incredibly frustrated with all the AI that has come out over the past year (e.g. ChatGPT). But it seems like it's getting more advanced and frankly unavoidable, even for us.

Earlier this week, I had a student email me an assignment and in the email there was another email address attached. It was an AI. The student had asked the AI to schedule a meeting between us for 0 hour before school started on Tuesday morning and it automatically did it. After I received an email from the same AI which automatically understood I was a teacher given the context of the student’s email and asked me if I wanted to check the work for plagiarism. I then received 3 other emails from students later that week and it’s been going around the school with other teachers using it to do research and create their lesson plans (a History teacher next to my class room used it to find documentaries for his students). Apparently it was created by the founding team of PayPal/YouTube so people trust it, but I still don't know how I feel about all of it. I'm curious if anyone else had this thing pop up at their school or is your school using AI directly? Where should the lines be drawn on if something is beneficial for both teachers and students but can also lead to cheating? I guess my main question is: how do we make sure AI is being used responsibly in schools, because it doesn't seem to be going away?

  
I'm a younger teacher but I've never been a person that loved messing around with technology so any thoughts here are appreciated it. I honestly feel super behind on the times with all of the things that are coming out. Thanks."

I mean that the usage of LLMs or 'copilot' type of thing is integrated into the learning process. The student is still learning how computers and software works, only they're augmented in their ability by having AI to help. Surely there's a way to balance this to get the best of both worlds.

The usage of natural language to code and AI generated code will be on a growth trajectory whereas writing code manually will be on the decline, **but** it is important that those learning to code with these new tools are not overly reliant on them, lest they will not really understand what they're learning.

So, do you know of courses/websites out there that have begun to try to strike the balance between the two?

A weird asteroid has just gotten a little weirder.

We have known for a while that asteroid 3200 Phaethon acts like a comet. It brightens and forms a tail when it's near the Sun, and it is the source of the annual Geminid meteor shower, even though comets are responsible for most meteor showers. Scientists had blamed Phaethon's comet-like behavior on dust escaping from the asteroid as it's scorched by the Sun. However, a new study using two NASA solar observatories reveals that Phaethon's tail is not dusty at all but is actually made of sodium gas.

Community health workers followed an intervention algorithm to assess parental and family motivations and lifestyle goals and assist them in creating action plans at quarterly contacts, alternating in-person and telephone contact. Intervention behavioral targets included reduction of sugar-sweetened beverages, reduction of high calorie snacks, reduction of screen time, increase in fruits and vegetables, and increase in physical activity. Families would set a goal to make progress toward these targets and the community health worker would follow up with information about free or low-cost community resources that were available to support their goal.

“If your pet is anxious, do your best to provide them with comfort by creating a safe place for them and talking in a calming voice,” Matejka adds.

Since 2013, PM2.5 levels have steadily declined, and in 2021, the average annual exposure was 33.3 micrograms per cubic metre (see ‘Fresh air’). That’s below the nation’s air-quality standard of 35, but still much higher that the recommended level of 5 set by the World Health Organization (WHO), based in Geneva, Switzerland.

The decline in PM2.5 is the result of targeted efforts by China over the past two decades to address poor air quality. Upgrades to coal-fired power plants have had the biggest effect so far, says Qiang Zhang, an atmospheric scientist at Tsinghua University in Beijing.

In her work, Lawrence has found some adults seem to ruminate in only one form, while most teens report ruminating in both verbal thoughts and mental imagery. One possibility is that these thought patterns become self-reinforcing habits, she said, with the negative images or verbal messages becoming more ingrained over time.

""That's why I like working with teenagers: If we can interrupt these processes early in development, maybe we can help these teens get to adulthood and not get stuck in these negative thinking patterns,"" Lawrence said. ""All of us ruminate. It's a matter of how long we do it for, and what skills we have to stop when we want to.""

Chemicals with known hazards are present in consumer products used regularly in the home and workplace. These products are an important source of chemical exposures. (1−5) Indeed, chemical exposures from use of consumer products are often higher than environmentally mediated, far-field exposures. (2,6) Identifying product ingredients is the first step in assessing associated health risks and prioritizing products for reformulation based on hazard. However, the data gap created by nonexistent or incomplete regulatory requirements for ingredient disclosure complicates even this initial identification step.

Sometimes stretching thousands of kilometers, atmospheric rivers transport moisture away from the tropics to other parts of the globe. They are a necessary part of the global weather cycle and can bring needed rains to drought-stricken areas. But they can also contribute to dangerous flooding.

A group of ex-TikTok employees has blown the whistle on the company's alleged practice of keeping a list of users who watched gay content for at least a year.

Researchers have created a clever algorithm that can “eavesdrop” on satellite signals to pinpoint any location on Earth, much like GPS. The study showed for the first time that the algorithm could take advantage of signals sent by multi-constellation low Earth orbit satellite (LEO) satellites, such as Starlink, OneWeb, Orbcomm, and Iridium.

By listening to signals from eight LEO satellites for about 10 minutes, the algorithm was able to pinpoint a stationary receiver on the ground with incredible accuracy, making an error of only about 5.8 meters.

The sheer magnitude of the October 2021 die-off, when thousands, possibly millions, of herring washed up, is what sticks in the minds of the residents of Kotzebue, Alaska. Fish were “literally all over the beaches,” says Bob Schaeffer, a fisherman and an elder from the Qikiqtaġruŋmiut tribe.

Despite the dramatic deaths, there was no apparent culprit. “We have no idea what caused it,” says Alex Whiting, the environmental-program director for the Native Village of Kotzebue. He wonders if the die-off was a symptom of a problem he’s had his eye on for the past 15 years: blooms of toxic cyanobacteria, sometimes called blue-green algae, that have become more and more noticeable in the waters around this remote Alaska town.

With two out of every three homes in America already underinsured, skyrocketing prices may tempt homeowners to cut back even further on disaster coverage, putting them at significant risk when severe weather strikes.

They may also forgo additional coverage that they need more than ever. While mortgage lenders typically require homeowners to carry home insurance, most policies do not cover floods. With budgets tight, Mr. Hosfield anticipates that more homeowners will opt out of insurance for flood damage. “And that puts them in a pretty bad spot,” he said.

Those who were more excited and less scared thought that the experience was much shorter. I guess time flies when you’re having fun.

The body also goes into flight or flight mode, meaning that the parasympathetic nervous system takes over in the build up to jumping. A June 2013 study published in the journal Physiology & Behavior found that both first time skydivers and those who were more experienced had similarly elevated salivary cortisol levels. “These findings support previous research demonstrating that skydiving elicits acute cortisol activation,” write the study authors.

Additionally, an April 2019 study published in the journal Biological Psychology found that levels of testosterone in the body were also impacted by skydiving. As cortisol levels increased so too did levels of testosterone, especially in “adventure seeking” individuals...

“The first place to look is our food supply, but we also need to look at environmental toxins, such as plastics, pesticides, other chemicals, etc.,” Dr. Christopher Palmer, an assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School specializing in the connection between metabolism and mental health, who was not part of the study, wrote on Twitter. “Something in our environment is poisoning our mitochondria.”

Mitochondria, the tiny organs within a cell, play a central role in energy metabolism by converting energy from food into a form the body can use.

Dr. Anders Rehfeld, a Danish researcher in human sperm physiology, shares the same concern and notes the decline in sperm counts over the past 40 years. He wrote on Twitter that “such rapid, widespread changes clearly suggest environmental causes.”

Some may know this landscape includes the earliest evidence of human occupation in what is now Australia, at Madjedbebe, where signs of habitation have been dated to 65,000 years ago.

Most people, however, ignore the expansive floodplains surrounding these sites, especially when they are covered by water during the wet season.

Our research, recently published in PLOS One, shows these floodplains hide a complex landscape buried deep underground critical to understanding the deep history of the region. We have mapped the cliffs and rivers, more than 15 metres below the current surface, which would have greeted the first people to arrive here.

Being this massive makes it an ultramassive black hole.[10]

According to a black hole calculator, it would have a radius of about 207 billion km or a diameter of 414 billion km. The event horizon of this thing can fit 11 Solar Systems side by side, so large that it would take light a week to reach the singularity after crossing the event horizon. But in reality, it is probably even larger. Since TON 618 is so far away, we only see how it looked like 10 billion years ago.[1]

But, in terms of physical activity levels, we were able to show that participants who commuted 3 km or less appeared to be more physically active. This could be because this distance made it easier to commute by bicycle or foot to work – or because a shorter commute gave participants time before and after work to exercise.

Smaller than the wavelength of light, the new LED was used to build the world’s smallest holographic microscope, paving the way for existing cameras in everyday devices such as mobile phones to be converted into microscopes via only modifications to the silicon chip and software. This technology also represents a significant step forward in the miniaturisation of diagnostics for indoor farmers and sustainable agriculture.

A federal appeals court ruled Tuesday that the Environmental Protection Agency must regulate perchlorate, reversing a Trump-era rollback on a drinking water contaminant linked to brain damage in infants.

A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled unanimously in an appeal brought by the Natural Resources Defense Council last year after the EPA, under the Biden administration, stood by the rollback. Two judges wrote that the EPA had no authority to withdraw from a 2011 determination that perchlorate should be regulated.

Circuit Judge Florence Pan, in a concurring opinion, went further. She called the EPA’s decision not to regulate perchlorate “arbitrary” and “capricious” and rejected the agency’s assertion that perchlorate was occurring at lower levels than previously thought. That assertion relied on a ”biased dataset that was selectively updated,” wrote Pan, who was appointed by President Joe Biden last year.

Common food additives known as metal oxide nanoparticles may have negative effects on your gut health, according to new research from Binghamton University, State University of New York and Cornell University.

Gretchen Mahler, professor of biomedical engineering and interim vice provost and dean of the Graduate School, worked in collaboration with Cornell researchers to study five of these nanoparticles. Their findings were recently published in the Journal of Antioxidants.

“They’re all actual food additives,” said Mahler. “Titanium dioxide tends to show up as a whitening and brightening agent. Silicon dioxide tends to be added to foods to prevent it from clumping. Iron oxide tends to be added to meats, for example, to keep that red color. And zinc oxide can be used as a preservative because it’s antimicrobial.”

However, with Russia’s war in Ukraine and the rise in cybersecurity activity over the past few years, the FBI has increased its monitoring of Russian cyber threats.

While the Snake malware is an elegantly designed piece of code, it is complex and needs to be precisely deployed to avoid detection. According to the Department of Justice’s press release, Russian cyber spies were careless in more than a few instances and did not deploy it as designed.

As a result, the Americans discovered Snake, and crafted a response.

Consequently, cells may lack the ability to further boost autophagy to defend against other dangers, such as smoke inhalation or a viral or bacterial infection. This may help explain why air pollution increases a person's risk for a number of acute and chronic lung diseases, including lung cancer, interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

As part of the research, Crandall and his team also developed a new method of studying autophagy, which can support future studies on the subject. They used a combination of fluorescent dyes and a powerful imaging method, known as confocal microscopy, to document the amount of autophagy taking place inside individual cells.

More than half of the world's large lakes and reservoirs are losing water — and climate change and human consumption are the main drivers, a new large-scale study warns.

Why it matters: About one-quarter of the world's population, or 2 billion people, lives in the basin of a drying lake — underscoring an urgent need to incorporate climate change and sedimentation impacts into sustainable water resources management, per the study, published in the journal Science

Palaeontologists have discovered two new species of dinosaur, with one set of fossil fragments coming from a creature thought to be one of the largest to ever exist.

Uncovered in Argentina’s southern Patagonia region, the gigantic species of long-necked herbivorous dinosaur would have weighed 50 tonnes and measured 30 metres in length – roughly equivalent to that of a blue whale.

Its bones were so big that they caused a van carrying them to a laboratory to tip over, with scientists naming the dinosaur ‘Chucarosaurus Diripienda’, meaning scrambled, after its remains were rolled around during the car accident.

Research carried out in conjunction with INTU, a manufacturer of boiling water taps, found there are minerals in hard water which inhibit flavour compounds forming.

But proteins in the milk lower the mineral content of the water, Professor Mackie says, and gives a brew extra flavour, especially when the water is hard.

'Flavour by and large is produced by the different compounds in tea including tannins in particular,' Professor Mackie says.

'The more minerals present in water the more difficult it is for these compounds to develop the flavour - resulting in the dull cuppas you get in hard water areas.

A Popular Sweetener Had A Worrying Impact on Generations Of Mice

Could the sweetened drinks we knock back make us feel a little more anxious? A 2022 study that looked at the effects of the artificial sweetener aspartame on mice suggested that it's a possibility that's worth investigating further.

Approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1981, aspartame is widely used in low-calorie foods and drinks. Today, it's found in nearly 5,000 different products, consumed by adults and children.

However, and somewhat surprisingly, there is increasing evidence that nature – an engineer with billions of years of practice — has learned how to use quantum mechanics to function optimally.

It also means that we could possibly control physiological processes by using the quantum properties of biological matter.

In a popular BuzzFeed article, Anne Helen Petersen describes how millennials (people born between 1981 and 1996) became “the burnout generation”. She describes some of the stark consequences of edging towards burnout and identifies what she calls “errand paralysis”, marked by a struggle to do even simple or mundane tasks.

Many of the factors contributing to this burnout are rooted in the challenging job and economic conditions that millennials face, according to Petersen. She also describes “intensive parenting” as a contributing factor, because millennials have been relentlessly trained and prepared for the workplace by their parents. They have internalised the idea that they need to be working all the time or engaging in the never-ending pursuit of self-optimisation.

But the majority went much farther and went really a much deeper cut into the EPA's authority. What did they rule?

Coral Davenport:

Essentially, they said that the EPA, which, until yesterday, had the authority to regulate most of the wetlands in the United States to protect the wetlands and to punish anyone who had polluted them, sharply limited or sharply reduced the amount of wetlands that would be subject to federal protection.

It said, in order for a wetland to be subject to some — any kind of federal protection regulation, it has to directly join up to or be connected to a larger body of water.

Are flours made with pulses better for us?

One of our most unhealthy collective eating habits in the West is not having enough fibre in our diets. A diet high in fibre is associated with numerous health benefits, including a decreased risk of heart disease and early death.

You might worry that boosting your intake of fibre through whole foods, including fruit, vegetables, pulses and wholegrains, means having to sacrifice some of your favourite foods. But in recent years, manufacturers have introduced higher fibre alternatives to many of our traditionally low-fibre staples – including pastas, crisps, breakfast cereals and cereal bars. But are they any better than the foods they replace?

They estimate that between 6,000-8,000 species are waiting to be discovered, but also note that this is likely an underestimate.

Ocean circulation in the deep waters around Antarctica has slowed significantly over the past three decades, posing a threat to the climate system, according to a new study.

Ocean circulation has kept climate change in check by drawing heat from the sea surface down to its depths. As polar waters freeze, they expel salt, causing surrounding waters to grow more saline — and thus, heavier — and sink to the ocean floor. But rising temperatures are increasingly melting polar ice, disrupting this process.

With approximately 500,000 L1 jumping genes, accounting for 17% of the human genome, they have long been recognized for their contribution to the evolution of the human species by introducing 'disruptive innovation' to genome sequences. Until now, it was believed that most L1 elements had lost their ability to jump in normal tissues of modern humans. However, this study reveals that some L1 jumping genes can be widely activated in normal cells, leading to the accumulation of genomic mutations over an individual's lifetime.

Cancers often release molecules into the bloodstream that pathologically alter the liver, shifting it to an inflammatory state, causing fat buildup and impairing its normal detoxifying functions, according to a study from investigators at Weill Cornell Medicine. This discovery illuminates one of cancer's more insidious survival mechanisms and suggests the possibility of new tests and drugs for detecting and reversing this process.

A new neuroimaging study has found that individuals who consumed their first alcoholic drink before the age of 18 had weaker connections in the brain’s cognitive control network compared those who consumed their first alcoholic drink after the age of 18. This suggests that starting to drink alcohol at a young age might make this brain network less effective. The study was published in Psychiatry Research: Neuroimaging.

A literature review published last month in the journal Frontiers in Built Environment, for example, looked at 100 recent studies on the topic and found that not one of them evaluated potential health costs of putting used plastic into roads, buildings, and other construction applications. Several studies addressed environmental implications, but mostly to highlight the potential to divert plastic waste from landfills.

According to Erica Cirino, lead author of the review and the communications manager for the nonprofit Plastic Pollution Coalition, it was these omissions that allowed the majority of the studies to portray putting discarded plastics into infrastructure as a “net positive.”

The shrinking homebuyer market

Owning a home is one of the main ways for the American middle class to accumulate wealth. Despite this, home ownership declined by 5.5.% between 2007 and 2016. Who owns these homes is even more divided based on race. From 2015 to 2019, homeownership among Black families in the U.S. was 41.7% and for white families 71.7%.

Simultaneously, large private investment firms started buying single-family homes often to flip the houses and rent them at higher rates. Although smaller investment groups often buy homes, the major impact on the market comes from large private institutions.

Analyzing the data

Investors have long been suspected of buying up substantial portions of the housing market, but determining just how many has been challenging

Though the study was small -- 12 participants -- it found that kombucha may help lower blood sugar levels in people with Type 2 diabetes. Fermented with bacteria and yeasts, the drink has been consumed in China since 200 B.C. but it has been embraced in the United States only since the 1990s, researchers said.

""Apple cider vinegar was really taking off and people were talking about it all the time and kombucha,"" said study author Dr. Daniel Merenstein, director of family medicine research at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. ""And they have a farmers market at Georgetown where they sell kombucha, so we just thought, this kombucha is more tasty, easier to drink than apple cider vinegar ... so that's really what got us to do this study.""

But better data alone will not reduce inequality, Wilkinson points out. Asked why he thinks SDG 10 is failing, he points to a reduction in inequality that occurred in high-income nations from the 1930s until the end of the 1970s, broadly because social movements challenged the state to play a bigger part in protecting vulnerable people. He thinks something like that will need to happen again. “Given the powerful interests involved,” he says. “I don’t know why anyone thought that a statement of goals such as the SDGs would succeed.”

Researchers are right to urge leaders to prioritize inequality. They would do even better to study the efforts of Pickett, Wilkinson and others, and determine the reasons why these did not bear fruit.

Is prompt engineering worth learning?

Beyond playing with some tips and tricks, formally learning how to write prompts seems a bit pointless for most people. For one thing, AI models are constantly being updated and replaced. Specific prompting techniques that work now may only work in the short term.

People looking to get rich from prompt engineering would be better advised to focus on pairing AI and problem formulation in their area of expertise. For example, if you’re a pharmacist you might try using generative AI to double check warning labels on prescriptions.

Along the way you’ll sharpen your expository writing, acquire the basic generative AI skills (which employers might appreciate), and maybe strike gold with a killer application for the right audience.

Once Scalene has identified where Python is having trouble keeping up, it then uses AI -- leveraging the same technology underpinning ChatGPT -- to suggest ways to optimize individual lines, or even groupings of code. ""This is an actionable dashboard,"" says Berger. ""It's not just a speedometer telling you how fast or slow your car is going, it tells you if you could be going faster, why your speed is affected and what you can do to get up to maximum speed.""

Digital information exchange can be safer, cheaper and more environmentally friendly with the help of a new type of random number generator for encryption. The researchers behind the study believe that the new technology paves the way for a new type of quantum communication.

The research, published today in Nature Plants, shows plants have gradually developed their range of anatomical designs throughout the passage of time, punctuated by episodic bursts of innovation to overcome and adapt to environmental challenges.

Such findings overturn the long-held belief that, much like animals, the fundamental range of plant types evolved in a big burst of sudden change early in their evolutionary history.

Co-lead author Philip Donoghue, Professor of Palaeobiology at the University of Bristol, said: “Although plants are extraordinarily diverse in their design and organisation, they share a common ancestor which originated at sea more than a billion years ago.

Some common mycotoxins in cereals are aflatoxins (AFs), ochratoxins (OTs), and Fumonisins (FUMs). The genus Fusarium also produces Zearalenone (ZEA) and trichothecenes. 

Besides cereals, mycotoxins contaminate other agricultural commodities, e.g., spices, nuts, coffee beans. Studies have implicated mycotoxin contamination in acute toxicity and chronic diseases in humans, e.g., cancer and neural tube defects.

The health of people with diabetes, hypertension and obesity improved when they could get free fruits and vegetables with a prescription from their doctors and other health professionals.

We found that these patients' blood sugar levels, blood pressure and weight improved in our new study published in Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes.

The improvements we saw in clinical outcomes could have a meaningful impact on overall health. For example, systolic blood pressure, or blood pressure during heartbeats, decreased by more than 8 millimeters of mercury, or mm Hg, while diastolic blood pressure, or blood pressure between heartbeats, decreased by nearly 5 mm Hg. For context, this is about half the drop gained through medications that lower blood pressure.

Comet Nishimura was discovered only in August but will be closest to Earth in a week’s time – just before dawn on Tuesday 12 September.
The object, which is travelling through space at 240,000 miles per hour, is already visible to the naked eye, according to professor Brad Gibson, director of the E A Milne Centre for Astrophysics at the University of Hull.
Prof Gibson said Nishimura can currently be seen in the hour after sunset and the hour before dawn by looking east-north-east, towards the crescent moon and Venus.

“Anything away from homeostasis, the brain is going to not be happy and react in some way,” she said. With heat stroke, for example, one symptom is central nervous system dysfunction, “which just means the person is not making good decisions.”

In a lecture available on YouTube, behavioral ecologist Michael Pardo from Colorado State says his team's findings potentially ""blur the line"" between ""what we think is unique to human language versus what is found in other animal communication systems.""

Elephants are known for their loud, trumpet-like vocalizations, but the vast majority of their communication can't actually be heard by humans.

Instead, these large mammals mostly produce low-frequency rumbles, which can deliver messages to the feet of other elephants as far as six kilometers away.

Elephants spend the vast majority of their day in search of food, and it's not uncommon for the herd to lose sight of each other in that endeavor. Calling each other by names would be a useful way to keep tabs on the herd.

To explore that possibility, Pardo and his colleagues spent hours recording elephant rumbles in the wild, at two separate locations in Kenya.

The evolution of fever is a classic conundrum because fever’s effects seem so harmful. Besides making you feel uncomfortable, you may also worry you’ll dangerously overheat. It is also metabolically costly to generate that much heat.

In our research and review, we propose that since fever occurs throughout much of the animal kingdom, this costly response must have benefits or it never would have evolved or been retained across species over time. We highlight several important but rarely considered points that help explain how the heat of fever helps your body fight infections.

“I think there are two different ways to think about the intersection of poverty and nutrition promotion,” Bauer said. “The first is that in addition to having proven positive effects on child nutrition, food assistance programs—like school meals—reduce poverty generally, which has widespread benefits for families. The second is that poverty reduction programs—like the child tax credit—have direct positive influences on children’s nutrition. It’s been shown that when low-income families are provided more cash assistance, they use it to buy healthier foods for their kids.”

More about Dai’s studies on natural bioremediation

The current study using fungus to remove microplastics is compatible with Dai’s previous research using fungus to remediate PFAS or “forever chemicals” in the environment.

“Fungi have unique environmental applications due to their diversity and robustness,” Dai said. “They have also been useful in our ability to develop a novel bioremediation technology for these chemicals, which can threaten human health and ecosystem sustainability.”

PFAS are used in many applications ranging from food wrappers and packaging, to dental floss, fire-fighting foam, nonstick cookware, textiles and electronics.

Dai’s new technology uses a plant-derived material to absorb the PFAS and dispose of them by means of microbial fungi that literally eat them.

Searching for a cosmic laundromat

Supermassive black holes are enormous, measuring roughly the width of the solar system, so it can take a photon around six days travelling at the speed of light to make an orbit. At the end of these six days, photons can either perform a U-turn to make another orbit, or fly into or away from the black hole. The photons that slip a black hole's gravity emerge in the form of an ultrathin halo around the pure black chasm: a photon sphere.

In a world where AI algorithms can already analyze real-time financial information and make high-stakes trading decisions with little or no human oversight, our financial regulations are failing to keep up.

How well are you sleeping? Are you eating foods that nourish you? Did you make time for a favorite hobby and exercise? Did you gather with friends or loved ones?

Your answers to these questions may help explain your mood — and your risk of depression too. In fact, a new study finds that people who maintain a broad range of healthy habits, from good sleep to physical activity to strong social connections, are significantly less likely to experience episodes of depression.

while psychedelics have been used for centuries in various cultural and spiritual contexts, they fell out of favor in the mid-20th century due to legal restrictions and societal concerns.

But in recent years, researchers have reignited the interest in these substances, exploring their potential to treat a wide range of neuropsychiatric and behavioral health conditions. While traditional antidepressant medications can take weeks to produce noticeable improvements and need to be taken daily, early-phase trials suggested that psilocybin‐""magic mushroom""-assisted psychotherapy might offer rapid and long-lasting therapeutic effects after just one or two doses.

Strikingly, fs8.1 was absent in fresh market varieties. Compared to the fruit of processing tomato, the fruit of fresh market tomato is of higher quality in terms of nutrition and flavor. However, fresh market tomato fruit may experience severe soft-fruit-related deterioration during harvest, transportation and storage. Natural ripening-related mutations have been used to improve fruit firmness. However, they often adversely affect color, flavor and nutritional quality. fs8.1 does not affect fruit ripening. Thus, cloning of FS8.1 offers a potential way to redesign fresh market tomatoes for mechanized production without compromising quality.

Why were the results unique?

The discovery of trilobites at such a time and place is not too surprising. However, what was unexpected was the diversity and abundance within this core.

Normally, cored rocks only have a small area for fossils to be captured so usually there's little chance of hitting a fossil, let alone something useful for identification. Yet, in this sequence trilobites were so abundant that almost every single layer of rock contained a fragment. In fact, the rock is entirely made of trilobites in places, stacked one on top of each other, like a pack of playing cards!

The sources of these emissions have changed over recent decades. Emissions of NOx and VOCs from vehicles have fallen significantly, however consumer and industrial volatile chemical products (VCPs) are an increasing source of VOC emissions.

VCPs include a number every-day products, such as paint, domestic cleaning agents and perfume, and are a large source of VOC emissions in densely populated urban areas.

Every product releases a different set of VOCs into the air, leaving behind a kind of ‘chemical fingerprint’. These chemicals then interact with one another in the air, sometimes creating new pollutants in a process known as ‘secondary formation’.

While it does not prove that exposure to chemicals like PFAS (per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances) and phenols (including BPA) led to these cancer diagnoses, it is a strong signal that they may be playing a role and should be studied further.

Late last year, Caltech researchers revealed that they had developed a new fabrication technique for printing microsized metal parts containing features about as thick as three or four sheets of paper.

Now, the team has reinvented the technique to allow for printing objects a thousand times smaller: 150 nanometers, which is comparable to the size of a flu virus. In doing so, the team also discovered that the atomic arrangements within these objects are disordered, which would, at large scale, make these materials unusable because they would be considered weak and ""low quality."" In the case of nanosized metal objects, however, this atomic-level mess has the opposite effect: these parts can be three-to-five-times stronger than similarly sized structures with more orderly atomic arrangements.

Researchers have uncovered a simple structure from the Stone Age that may be the oldest evidence yet of early humans building with wood.

The construction is basic: a pair of overlapping logs, fitted together with a notch. It's nearly half a million years old and provides a rare look at how ancient human relatives were working with wood and changing their environments, authors wrote in a study published Wednesday in Nature.

""The study is important both in terms of how we understand voter behavior and the discussion about how the Swedish election system is designed,"" notes Axel Cronert, Docent in Political Science and one of the researchers behind the study.

There is a lack of studies into how queues affect turnout in countries like Sweden, which traditionally have very high voter turnout. A few studies in other countries have shown that long queues at the polling stations can frighten away voters looking to cast a ballot. In Sweden, long queues have historically been unusual, but during the general elections in 2022 reports came in of significant queues.

***Essays/LORs/Other:*** 

I am still workshopping my essays, but two consistent ideas that've consistently come up are leading a team of child-lobbyists on Capitol Hill for JDRF, and writing/producing my audio drama as a way to express a personal experience relating to themes which aren't getting spoken about nearly enough in realistic ways in major media (mental and emotional health in teenagers)! 

As for my LORs, I'm decently certain they'll be of high quality! I've got a handful of teachers I'm very close with, including two I've worked with for all three years of high school thus far, and a handful I've worked with for two years! For instance, one of those aforementioned teachers wrote a letter of recommendation for my Eagle Scout application, and my scoutmaster informed me it was one of the most thorough ones she's read!

  
Schools: 

I am planning on applying for USC early action (my absolute top school by a solid mile), as well as UCLA early action. I'm torn on whether to risk applying ED to Emory (my second choice)/Northwestern and being unable to attend USC if I get into both, but I'm going to be hinging this decision on how this year's AP's and awards pitter out for me! I've also considered UPenn and Brown, but both schools would require me to sacrifice a decent chunk of focus on either cinematic arts or business respectively (plus, ivies are no cakewalk to get into)!

&#x200B;

Whether or not people choose to attend a climate protest partly depends on its expected size. When they expect a larger protest, they are less likely to take part—as Universität Hamburg's Cluster of Excellence for climate research (CLICCS) shows in a publication in the journal Nature Climate Change.

Mass protests are an important motivator for politicians to implement ambitious climate policy. But what determines whether a protest movement grows or dwindles? The study at hand uses the example of the global climate strike from 2019 to show that, for many people in Germany, their participation depends on how many people they expect to attend a given demonstration. Accordingly, Fridays for Future's strategy—organizing multiple local protests at the same time, instead of one massive centralized event—can successfully motivate more people.

As sea levels rise – due to climate change and other natural factors – the “salt line,” a natural barrier where inland water meets the ocean’s salty water, is shifting. While shifts in this line are natural and have occurred for billions of years, it has recently shifted more inward, with seawater pushing the salt line further inland as it takes over. This poses a huge threat to our drinking water.

""As a country, we need to trust the institutions that we have in place and call them to order when they breach the law,"" Angote said, making reference to government bodies that regulate GM foods.

""We should be confident that our health is in good hands.""

An official from LSK told AFP there had not been a decision on whether to appeal the ruling.

Another case against GM crops filed by Paul Mwangi, a lawyer who is close to the opposition, is still active in court.

Kenya, like many other African nations, banned GM crops over health and safety concerns and to protect smallholder farms, which account for the vast majority of rural agricultural producers in the country.

However, the East African powerhouse faced criticism over the ban, including from the United States, which is a major producer of GM crops.

Activists and agriculture lobby groups have protested over the lifting of the ban, saying it opened the market to US farmers using sophisticated technologies and highly subsidized farming that threatened the livelihoods of small-scale farmers.

The researchers determined that a subset of patients with long COVID had traces of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in their stool samples even months after acute COVID-19 infection, which suggests that components of the virus remain in the gut of some patients long after infection. They found that this remaining virus, called a viral reservoir, triggers the immune system to release proteins that fight the virus, called interferons. These interferons cause inflammation that reduces the absorption of the amino acid tryptophan in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.

Tryptophan is a building block for several neurotransmitters, including serotonin, which is primarily produced in the GI tract and carries messages between nerve cells in the brain and throughout the body. It plays a key role in regulating memory, sleep, digestion, wound healing, and other functions that maintain homeostasis within the body. Serotonin is also an important regulator of the vagus nerve, a system of neurons that mediate the communication between the body and the brain.

It appears that some studies prescribing resistance exercise interventions were not sufficiently loaded to bring about the structural adaptations required for tendon repair (Gatz 2020, Cho 2017). 

Interventions where resistance exercise was done less frequently, with rest days, had better outcomes for disability, pain, function and quality of life than those doing resistance exercises daily or more than once a day. This is consistent with strength training principles which call for rest days to encourage better adaptive processes in the mechanical properties of tendons before further loading occurs. The most common number of total repetitions was 45 (e.g., 3 sets of 15 repetitions) but we did not find any consistent patterns of dose-response on patient outcomes in our analysis of exercise volume. 

What are the key take-home points?

Clinicians prescribing resistance exercise should consider including higher intensities, that involve adding external weight, and should ensure adequate rest between sessions to facilitate recovery.  Although some patients may need a longer period to build up their intensity it is important to keep reviewing whether the load intensity is adequate to trigger improvements.

They identified that gene expression was significantly changed in calorie-restricted participants compared to controls, including genes related to protein regulation, circadian rhythm regulation, DNA repair, programmed cell death (apoptosis), and inflammation.

There were changes in biological pathways involved in muscle repair and skeletal muscle formation (myogenesis), leading to an increase in skeletal muscle quality and the mechanisms of aging. Some upregulated genes included those responsible for energy generation and metabolism, while downregulated inflammatory genes reduced inflammation.

The researchers say their findings highlight the mechanisms by which calorie restriction provides health benefits, especially in older people.

A brain-inspired computer chip that could supercharge artificial intelligence (AI) by working faster with much less power has been developed by researchers at IBM in San Jose, California. Their massive NorthPole processor chip eliminates the need to frequently access external memory, and so performs tasks such as image recognition faster than existing architectures do — while consuming vastly less power.

“Its energy efficiency is just mind-blowing,” says Damien Querlioz, a nanoelectronics researcher at the University of Paris-Saclay in Palaiseau. The work, published in Science1, shows that computing and memory can be integrated on a large scale, he says. “I feel the paper will shake the common thinking in computer architecture.”

On Oct. 6, news broke that 23andMe, the Google-owned company that collects genetic material from thousands of people for ancestry and genetic predisposition tests, had a massive data breach.

But as it turns out, the company’s servers were not hacked. Rather, hackers targeted hundreds of individual user accounts — allegedly those that had weak or repeated passwords. After gaining access to the accounts, hackers could leverage the “DNA relatives matches” function of 23andMe to get information about thousands of people who didn’t use the service.

This data breach challenges how we think about privacy, data security and corporate accountability in the information economy.

The power of water

Tidal power has great potential because water is such a potent power source. It is nearly 1,000 times more dense than air, so the energy is far more concentrated.

And it has another big advantage over renewable technologies like wind and solar - the tides are predictable.

Wind and solar power are increasingly cheap to deploy, but only work when the sun is shining or the wind is blowing.

Tidal power, on the other hand, can deliver a steady, reliable stream of energy day in, day out.

The Rising Threat of Thyroid Cancer

The global incidence and mortality rates of thyroid cancers have increased significantly in recent decades. There has been an average of 3.6% increase in thyroid cancer incidence per year in the United States between 1974 and 2013. A similar induction has been observed in China, Italy, and Turkey. Among 10 – 19-year-olds in the United States, about a 4.4% increase in the incidence rates of differentiated thyroid cancers (follicular and papillary thyroid cancers) per year has been reported between 1998 and 2013.

""Scientists have a moral obligation to clearly warn humanity of any catastrophic threat and to 'tell it like it is.'""

“Without actions that address the root problem of humanity taking more from the Earth than it can safely give, we’re on our way to the potential collapse of natural and socioeconomic systems and a world with unbearable heat and shortages of food and freshwater,” study lead co-author and former Oregon State University College of Forestry postdoctoral researcher Christopher Wolf said in a statement.

A study last month in the journal Science Advances arrived at a similar conclusion. It noted that there are nine planetary boundaries that humanity cannot exceed if life on Earth is to remain sustainable. Climate change is only one of those boundaries, and it is one that humanity is obviously exceeding. Yet we are also at existential risk for six of the nine categories, including land system change, freshwater change, biosphere integrity, novel entities (like plastics, pesticides, industrial chemicals, etc.) and the flows of biological and geological chemicals.

The moth is not only destructive, it also reproduces at a high rate. A single cream-colored female moth with its thin antennae and brown zigzag-striped wings can lay 1,000 eggs, according to the department.

Washington state officials have largely been able to keep the spongy moth at bay by spending roughly $1 million on early detection and eradication.

Officials speculate that the high number this year is due to people resuming travel after the pandemic and inadvertently moving spongy moth egg masses from the Eastern U.S. into Washington,

Current valuation methods for forest conservation projects have come under heavy scrutiny, leading to a crisis of confidence in carbon markets. This is hampering efforts to offset unavoidable carbon footprints, mitigate climate change, and scale up urgently needed investment in tropical forest conservation.

Measuring the value of carbon storage is not easy. Recent research revealed that as little as 6% of carbon credits from voluntary REDD+ schemes result in preserved forests. And the length of time these forests are preserved is critical to the climate benefits achieved.

Now, a team led by scientists at the University of Cambridge has invented a more reliable and transparent way of estimating the benefit of carbon stored because of forest conservation.

The method is published today in the journal Nature Climate Change. In it, the researchers argue that saving tropical forests is not only vital for biodiversity, but also a much less expensive way of balancing emissions than most of the current carbon capture and storage technologies.

Analysing the data, the scientists found that in those areas where there was little deforestation both locally and regionally, the average change in land temperature over the 2001 to 2021 period was 0.3 °C. Locations with 40% to 50% local deforestation but little regional deforestation, warmed by an average of 1.3 °C.

In comparison, in areas with both local and regional deforestation, the average temperature rise was 4.4 °C.

An international team of researchers has discovered that formaldehyde, a widely spread pollutant and common metabolite in our body, interferes in the epigenetic programming of the cell. This finding expands the knowledge of formaldehyde, previously considered only as a DNA mutagen, and helps establishing a further link with cancer.
""This substance is especially concentrated in various products used in construction, furniture manufacturing, the textile industry and some hair products,"" comments Dr. Esteller. Going a step further, Dr. Pontel stresses this vision pointing out that ""formaldehyde is not only a significant environmental hazard, often found in polluted fumes, but it can also be generated within our bodies through the metabolism of common dietary substances like the sweetener aspartame. Moreover, our cells are continually producing formaldehyde, a known mutagen that can lead to cancer.""

Misunderstanding As A Catalyst

While feeling understood is always desired, being misunderstood is an opportunity that can lead to personal growth and creativity. It’s a paradoxical idea, yet history is replete with examples of individuals who found their uniqueness and creativity in moments of profound misunderstanding.

When we’re misunderstood, we’re pushed out of our comfort zones and forced to confront our own uniqueness. In the words of Mignault, “We feel understood when others view how our emotions are normal and even desirable.” The paradox lies in the tension created by being misunderstood. Mignault’s research raises an intriguing question: Could embracing this discomfort be a catalyst for personal transformation?

The Environmental Protection Agency will review the use of a chemical found in tires that has been linked with the deaths of salmon on the U.S. West Coast.

Spurred by a petition from West Coast tribes, the EPA will study the impact of the rubber preservative 6PPD with an eye to potentially banning its use. Through normal wear and tear, tires shed tiny bits of rubber rich in 6PPD. The preservative reacts with ozone pollution to form 6PPD-q, which is toxic to fish. Rainfall washes the chemical from streets and parking lots into streams and rivers. In the Pacific Northwest, 6PPD-q has proved deadly to coho salmon.

The scientists, in their research, mixed mycelium spores with other materials the spores could consume and be able to grow off of, like grains. The mixture was then placed into a warm, dark, and humid space while the mycelium grew and was then dried.

This process creates a building material that researchers say is a more natural replacement for foam, plastic or timber.

However, recent research has led the FDA to reconsider the safety of this food additive. Back in 1970, the FDA determined that BVO was no longer “Generally Recognized as Safe” (GRAS), leading to increased oversight and regulation of its use in food products. As a result, many beverage manufacturers gradually replaced BVO with alternative ingredients over the years. Consequently, BVO is currently found in very few beverages in the United States.

Who still uses uses BVO?

According to the Center for Science in the Public Interest, PepsiCo removed BVO from Gatorade in 2013, and both Coca-Cola and PepsiCo later announced they would remove the ingredient from all their beverages.

However, the Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit research and advocacy group focusing on consumer health, reports that 90 products on the market today still use BVO. The majority are different brands of orange soda. According to EWG’s list, brands including BVO include Food Lion sodas, some Great Value sodas, and Sun Drop citrus soda. Mountain Dew drinks are also mentioned on this organization’s list, but PepsiCo says they no longer use the ingredient in the popular drink.
According to the Environmental Working Group, this includes Sun Drop, made by Keurig Dr Pepper, as well as Orangette and Great Value Fruit Punch, made by Walmart.

""All of these risks of various types of natural disasters are correlated and increasing in frequency. And that presents a real problem for the insurance market. There's fundamental questions as to whether insurance as we know it is a sustainable business,"" said Angle.

The cost to insurance companies has skyrocketed over the years. Insurance agencies get their own insurance coverage, called reinsurance, to cover the risk of catastrophes. Those reinsurance rates have risen dramatically, too.

Angle says from 1964 to 1990, U.S. insurers paid out on average about $100 million a year for wildfires. Over the next 20 years, that number rose to $600 million a year. By 2018, wildfire insurance payouts were averaging almost $4 billion annually.

17twsb3,1,2023-11-12,Looking for other writing teachers who are structuring their courses around AI collaboration.,u/AlabasterTire,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/17twsb3/looking_for_other_writing_teachers_who_are/,"As a college writing instructor, I believe that some of my students are entering professions where generative AI is going to be a co-author for a lot of their future writing. I anticipate that prospective employers will expect them to use AI to write faster (and possibly better) than earlier generations of workers have been expected to write.  (How I feel about this shift is irrelevant--I think it's the reality my students are going to be entering, and I believe I have an obligation to prepare them to succeed in it.) I'm considering reworking my writing classes to teach my students to incorporate gen-AI in ways that elevate their final products above what ChatGPT can generate on its own and also what the students can generate on their own.  At that same time, I also need to teach them to write clearly on their own because some of them will be entering fields where privacy practices or company policy will not allow them to use generative AI. With these two considerations, I'm looking for ways to redesign my classes to meet both of these needs.   


I know other writing teachers must be doing this. If you're one of them, I'd love to chat with you about the principles and practices that undergird your instructional and assignment design and possibly to share actual assignments and methodologies. If you're interested in such a conversation, I'd love to talk either in this thread or via PM. I look forward to sharing ideas with you! "

If you ask me to write code I would have no idea how. I used to be a very good student who had very good study habits in high school and a high average but unfortunately I came out of a very emotionally abusive home which caused me to deal with CPTSD and anxiety the following year in university and that, of course, hindered my ability to study. Being used to caring about grades I resorted to cheating to get them. How can I catch up? We’re learning about client-servers programming, template engines, C, bits and bitwise operations and frankly I don’t know how to do any of it, I know some knowledge but not how to code. I really love tech and whenever I’ve coded I did have fun and I would be so happy to get into the field. Now that I’ve healed a bit, I would really like some help and some advice, thank you. 

Tldr; I’ve cheated for the first year and a half of my comp sci degree trying to deal with trauma from an emotionally abusive household and would love to get back on track but have no clue where to start. I also feel uncomfortable asking the profs for help as I feel as though that’s suspicious"

Welcome to AI Unraveled, the podcast that demystifies frequently asked questions on artificial intelligence and keeps you up to date with the latest AI trends. Join us as we delve into groundbreaking research, innovative applications, and emerging technologies that are pushing the boundaries of AI. From the latest trends in ChatGPT and the recent merger of Google Brain and DeepMind, to the exciting developments in generative AI, we've got you covered with a comprehensive update on the ever-evolving AI landscape. In today's episode, we'll cover the future of computing with AI agents revolutionizing personal assistance, healthcare, education, productivity, and entertainment. We'll also discuss the integration of AI agents in popular productivity tools, the challenges associated with their development, and the urgent privacy concerns and societal impact they raise. And if you want to dive deeper into understanding artificial intelligence, we recommend checking out the book ""AI Unraveled"" available at Shopify, Apple, Google, and Amazon.

Software has come a long way since Paul Allen and I started Microsoft, but in many ways, it still lacks intelligence. Currently, to perform any task on a computer, you need to specify which app to use. While you can draft a business proposal with Microsoft Word or Google Docs, these apps cannot help you with other activities like sending an email, sharing a selfie, analyzing data, scheduling a party, or buying movie tickets. Furthermore, even the best websites have a limited understanding of your work, personal life, interests, and relationships. They struggle to utilize this information to assist you effectively, a capability currently only found in human beings such as close friends or personal assistants.

However, over the next five years, this will dramatically change. Instead of using different apps for different tasks, you will simply need to express your desires to your device in everyday language. Depending on the extent to which you choose to share personal information, the software will be able to respond on a personal level, having a comprehensive understanding of your life. In the near future, anyone with online access will be able to have a personal assistant powered by advanced artificial intelligence, surpassing the capabilities of current technology.

This kind of software, referred to as an agent, can comprehend natural language and perform various tasks based on its knowledge of the user. Although I have been contemplating the concept of agents for almost 30 years and even discussed them in my book ""The Road Ahead"" back in 1995, recent advancements in AI have made them a practical reality. Agents will not only revolutionize how we interact with computers but also disrupt the software industry, marking the most significant computing revolution since the transition from command typing to icon tapping.

Some critics have raised concerns about the viability of personal assistant software, citing previous attempts by software companies that were not well received. One such example is Clippy, the digital assistant included in Microsoft Office that was eventually dropped. However, the upcoming wave of AI agents is expected to be much more advanced and widely adopted.

Unlike their predecessors, AI agents will offer a more sophisticated and personalized experience. They will be capable of engaging in nuanced conversations and will not be limited to simple tasks like writing a letter. Comparing Clippy to AI agents is akin to comparing a rotary phone to a modern mobile device.

AI agents will have the ability to assist with various aspects of your life. By gaining permission to track your online interactions and real-world activities, they will develop a comprehensive understanding of your personal and professional relationships, hobbies, preferences, and schedule. You will have the freedom to decide when and how the agent intervenes to provide assistance or guidance.

Contrasting AI agents with current AI tools, which are often limited to specific apps and only offer help upon direct request, highlights the immense potential of agents. These agents will be proactive, making suggestions before you even ask for them. They will seamlessly operate across different applications and continuously learn from your activities, recognizing patterns and intentions to deliver personalized recommendations. It is important to note that the final decisions will always be made by you.

AI agents have the potential to revolutionize several sectors, such as healthcare, education, productivity, entertainment, and shopping. One of the most exciting aspects is their ability to democratize services that are currently too expensive for the majority of individuals. With AI agents, individuals will have access to personalized planning, without having to pay for a travel agent or spend hours explaining their preferences.

In conclusion, the upcoming era of AI agents promises a revolutionary and highly personalized experience. They will provide a level of assistance, intelligence, and convenience that surpasses previous attempts at personal assistant software.

Today, artificial intelligence (AI) plays a crucial role in healthcare by assisting with administrative tasks. Abridge, Nuance DAX, and Nabla Copilot are examples of AI technology that can record audio during appointments and generate notes for doctors to review.

However, the real transformation will occur when AI agents can provide basic triage assistance to patients, offer advice on managing health problems, and help individuals determine if medical treatment is necessary. Furthermore, these agents will support healthcare workers in making critical decisions and increasing productivity. Glass Health, for instance, is an app that can analyze a patient summary and propose potential diagnoses for doctors to consider. This advancement in AI will be particularly beneficial for individuals in underserved areas with limited access to healthcare.

Implementing clinician-agents in healthcare will require a cautious approach due to the potential life and death implications. People will need reassurance that the overall benefits of health agents outweigh the imperfections and mistakes they may make. It is important to recognize that humans also make errors, and lack of access to medical care is a significant issue.

Mental health care is another domain where AI agents can make a substantial impact by increasing accessibility. Currently, regular therapy sessions may be perceived as a luxury, yet there is a substantial unmet need. RAND research indicates that half of all U.S. military veterans requiring mental health care do not receive it.

AI agents trained in mental health will pave the way for more affordable and easily accessible therapy. Wysa and Youper are early examples of chatbots in this field, but the capabilities of future agents will delve even deeper. With your consent, a mental health agent could gather information about your life history and relationships, be available on demand, and provide unwavering patience. It could also monitor your physical responses to therapy through wearable devices like smartwatches, such as detecting an increased heart rate when discussing a problem with your boss and suggesting when it may be helpful to seek support from a human therapist.

The field of education has long been anticipating the ways in which software can enhance teachers' work and enable students to learn more effectively. While it is important to note that software will not replace teachers, it does have the potential to complement their efforts by personalizing content and alleviating administrative tasks. This transformative shift is now beginning to take place.

An example of the current state-of-the-art technology in education is Khanmigo, a text-based bot developed by Khan Academy. This innovative tool functions as a tutor in subjects such as math, science, and humanities. It can explain complex concepts like the quadratic formula and provide math problems for students to practice. Additionally, it supports teachers in tasks such as creating lesson plans. I have been an admirer and supporter of Sal Khan's work for a considerable time, and I had the pleasure of hosting him on my podcast recently, where we discussed developments in education and AI.

However, text-based bots are only the initial wave of educational agents. These agents will open up a host of new learning opportunities. Currently, many families cannot afford one-on-one tutoring for their children. If educational agents can understand what makes a tutor effective, they can make this kind of personalized instruction accessible for everyone. For instance, by leveraging a student's interests such as Minecraft and Taylor Swift, an agent could teach them about calculating the volume and area of shapes using Minecraft and explore storytelling and rhyme schemes through Taylor Swift's lyrics. Such an experience would be far more engaging, incorporating graphics and sound, and tailored to each student's specific needs, surpassing the capabilities of today's text-based tutoring.

In conclusion, the integration of intelligent agents into education holds great promise for personalized learning experiences. By leveraging technology effectively, we can revolutionize the way knowledge is imparted and enable students to thrive in their educational journeys.

In today's competitive landscape, numerous technology giants are venturing into the realm of productivity enhancements. Microsoft, for instance, is integrating its Copilot feature into widely-used applications like Word, Excel, Outlook, and others. Similarly, Google is leveraging its Assistant with Bard to bolster productivity tools. These copilots possess impressive capabilities, such as converting written documents into slide decks, providing natural language-based answers to spreadsheet queries, and summarizing email threads while representing individual perspectives.

However, the potential of productivity agents goes even further. Employing a productivity agent will be akin to having a dedicated personal assistant capable of independently undertaking a variety of tasks at your behest. For instance, if you possess a business idea, your agent will assist in crafting a comprehensive business plan, creating a compelling presentation, and even generating visualizations of your envisioned product. Companies will have the ability to make agents readily available for their employees, thereby enabling direct consultations and ensuring maximum engagement during meetings.

Regardless of the work environment, a productivity agent will offer support similar to that of personal assistants to executives today. If your friend undergoes surgery, your agent can offer to send flowers and handle the entire ordering process. In the scenario where you express a desire to reconnect with a college roommate, your agent will collaborate with their own agent to find a suitable meeting time. Prior to your meeting, it will kindly remind you that their oldest child recently commenced studies at a local university.

With the advent of productivity agents, individuals will experience a new level of efficiency and assistance, both in their professional and personal lives.

Already, artificial intelligence (AI) has the ability to enhance our entertainment and shopping experiences. AI can assist in selecting a new television and offer recommendations for movies, books, shows, and podcasts. Additionally, there are companies, including one that I have invested in, that have introduced AI-powered tools like Pix. This tool allows users to ask questions about their preferences and provides recommendations based on their past likes. Notably, Spotify has an AI-powered DJ that not only plays songs according to personal preferences but also engages in conversation and can even address users by their names.

In the future, AI agents will not only make recommendations but also help users take action. For example, if a user wants to buy a camera, their agent will read reviews, summarize them, offer a recommendation, and even place an order once a decision is made. If a user expresses interest in watching a movie like ""Star Wars,"" the agent will determine if they are subscribed to the appropriate streaming service and offer assistance in signing up if necessary. In cases where users are unsure of what they want to watch, the agent will provide customized suggestions and facilitate the playback of the chosen movie or show.

AI agents will also personalize news and entertainment content based on individual interests. CurioAI is an example of this, as it creates custom podcasts on any subject of interest. These advancements in AI agents will have significant implications for the software industry and society as a whole.

Agents will essentially become the next platform in the computing industry. In contrast to current practices where coding and graphic design skills are necessary to create new apps or services, users will simply communicate their desires to their agents. The agents will handle tasks such as coding, designing the app's appearance, creating a logo, and publishing the app to an online store. OpenAI's recent launch of GPTs provides a glimpse into a future where even non-developers can easily create and share their own AI assistants.

AI agents will revolutionize both how we use software and how it is developed. They will replace traditional search sites, offering superior information retrieval and summarization capabilities. E-commerce platforms will also face substitution as agents scout for the best prices available from various vendors. Ultimately, agents will replace word processors, spreadsheets, and other productivity applications. The integration of these functions will lead to the convergence of separate businesses, such as search advertising, social networking with advertising, shopping, and productivity software, into a unified entity.

While I believe that no single company will dominate the agent market, there will be numerous AI engines available. Although some agents may be free with ad support, most will be paid for. Companies, therefore, will be incentivized to ensure that agents prioritize user interests over advertisers. Given the remarkable amount of competition emerging in the AI field, the cost of agents is expected to be very affordable.

However, before we witness the full potential of sophisticated agents, we must address several questions regarding the technology and its usage. While I have previously discussed the broader AI concerns, I will now focus specifically on issues pertaining to agents.

The development of personal agents presents several technical challenges that are yet to be fully resolved. One major challenge is determining the most effective data structure for these agents. Currently, there is no consensus on what the ideal database for capturing and recalling nuanced information related to an individual's interests and relationships should look like. A new type of database that can accomplish this while still prioritizing privacy is needed.

In addition, the question of how individuals will interact with multiple agents remains open. Will personal agents be separate from other specialized agents like therapist agents or math tutors? If so, it raises the question of when these agents should collaborate and when they should operate independently.

Various options are being explored to facilitate interaction with personal agents. Companies are considering platforms such as apps, glasses, pendants, pins, and even holograms. However, it is speculated that earbuds may be the breakthrough technology for human-agent interaction. Personal agents could use earbuds to communicate with users, speaking to them or appearing on their phones when necessary. Earbuds could also enhance auditory experiences by blocking out background noise, amplifying speech, or improving comprehension of heavily accented speech.

Furthermore, there are several other challenges that need to be addressed. Currently, there is no standardized protocol that enables communication between different agents. The cost of personal agents needs to decrease to ensure accessibility for everyone. Prompting personal agents in a manner that yields accurate responses also requires improvement. Additionally, precautions must be taken to prevent hallucinations, particularly in areas like healthcare where accuracy is crucial. It is equally important to ensure that agents do not cause harm due to biases. Finally, steps should be taken to prevent agents from performing unauthorized actions. While concerns exist about rogue agents, the potential misuse of agents by human criminals is a more pressing worry.

The convergence of technology and the digital world brings forth pressing concerns regarding online privacy and security. As this fusion intensifies, the urgency to address these issues becomes paramount. It is essential that individuals have control over the information accessible to their digital agents, ensuring that their data is shared with trusted individuals and organizations of their choosing.

Yet, the matter of ownership arises. Who ultimately possesses the data shared with one's agent, and how can one guarantee its appropriate use? No one desires targeted advertisements based on private conversations with their therapist agent. Additionally, can law enforcement employ an individual's agent as evidence against them? Moreover, when should an agent refuse to carry out actions that may be detrimental to the individual or others? Who determines the core values ingrained in these digital agents?

Furthermore, the extent of information that an agent should divulge emerges as a significant question. For instance, if one intends to meet a friend, it is undesirable for the agent to disclose exclusive plans, which may convey a sense of exclusion. Similarly, when assisting with work-related tasks such as email composition, the agent must recognize the boundaries of privacy by refraining from utilizing personal or proprietary data from previous employments.

Many of these quandaries are already at the forefront of the tech industry and legislative agendas. Recently, I engaged in an AI forum organized by Senator Chuck Schumer, alongside other technology leaders and numerous U.S. senators. During this forum, we exchanged ideas, deliberated upon these issues, and stressed the necessity for robust legislative measures.

However, certain matters cannot be solely resolved by companies and governments. Digital agents could significantly impact our interactions with friends and family. Presently, expressing care for someone involves remembering meaningful details of their life, such as birthdays. Yet, when individuals become aware that their agents essentially prompted these gestures and took care of arrangements, will the sentiment remain as genuine for the recipient?

In the distant future, digital agents may instigate profound existential queries. Imagine a world where agents provide a high quality of life for everyone, rendering extensive human labor unnecessary. In such a scenario, what purpose would individuals seek? Would pursuing education still be desirable when agents possess all knowledge? Can a society truly prosper when leisure time becomes abundant for the majority?

Nevertheless, we have yet to reach that juncture. Meanwhile, the rise of digital agents is imminent. In the coming years, they will irrevocably transform our lives, both within the digital realm and offline.

Yann LeCun, a prominent figure in the AI field, has been instrumental in fostering the AI ecosystem in France. After leaving France 35 years ago, he established FAIR-Paris, providing opportunities for young scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs in AI research and development. His research is open and accessible to the global community [3]. LeCun's recent paper on role-playing with large language models, initially behind a paywall, is now freely available [4]. In 2016, he taught a course at Collège de France, which was a stepping stone for French students in their deep learning journey. Since 2018, FAIR-Paris has hosted 20 to 30 resident PhD students annually, graduating 5 to 10, contributing to the growth of the French AI research, development, and startup ecosystem [5].







A recent analysis suggests that the probability of doom given the existence of AI is lower than the probability of doom without AI [6]. However, there are still challenges to overcome in AI development. For instance, the ""Chihuahua or Muffin"" problem in computer vision remains unsolved by GPT-4V, which struggles to reason about the same images in a different layout and often miscounts the number of images. It also misrecognizes a Chihuahua as a muffin when asked about a specific image. These issues may stem from the model being trained on the original image and memorizing its labels [7].







Greg Brockman, another AI enthusiast, shares his diverse uses of ChatGPT, including coding, cooking, translating anime, suggesting chord modulations for a song, and conducting bio research [9].







In international news, Presidents Joe Biden and Xi Jinping are expected to announce a landmark agreement banning the use of AI in autonomous weaponry and the control and deployment of nuclear warheads. This agreement, to be announced at a bilateral meeting, is seen as a promising first step in regulating AI in autonomous weapons [10].

I've realized now that a Plus account is required in order to interact with custom GPTs, which means I'm not able to give my students access to it. Does anyone know of a workaround for this? If there's not a workaround, is anyone here aware of a similar AI program that can do what I'm looking for?"

Isn't the answer obviously that there is nothing really teachers can do about students using AI to cheat and not do the work, and that the political-corporate leaders of America have decided to let AI rip?

First paper was on an obscure topic, and I had a my usual (pre-AI) paper breakdown... 3 outstanding papers, a few As, a few Bs, and the rest Cs.  (I have high standards... the papers get better as the semester goes on.)  

I also added an in-class midterm. 

Here's the practical problem:   3 of my 4 top papers on the first and second papers got Cs on their in-class midterm essays.  And the new papers by them are *perfect*... literally, not one single mistake.  (perfect grammar, every comma correct, etc.)   Even though TurnItIn says ""0% AI"", it's just NOT feasible that 3 students would write phenomenally perfect essays, but write crappy in class mid-term essays. 

So, what I obviously ""should"" do is call them in for the promised/threatened oral defense.   But here's the rub:  the class has a *great* dynamic thus far (one of the best), and this implicit accusation will likely throw a wrench in that.  Also, I am *so* crushed.  I just don't. have. the. time. 

What would you do?  

Now for the spiritual- philosophical issue:   I am *so* demoralized by this.   I feel that my main claim to importance in students' education is that I work closely with them on their writing... and they get better!  They do!   And all of my massive/time-consuming effort is worth it, because being able to write well is such a boost to *any* career....

... and yet, does it matter now?  Now that everyone (including my students) will just have some dumb-ass AI write perfect memos for them for the rest of their lives, why bother with education?    What's the point??!  Our society will just be slaves to the internet, endlessly regurgitating... why should I even bother trying to train them to write or think critically, when it all will be done for them?    Is my very profession now so pointless?"

17v35xr,1,2023-11-14,Using AI to edit / check papers,u/johnbmason47,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/17v35xr/using_ai_to_edit_check_papers/,"Just had a guy get bounced from my grad school program for using an AI to write his entire thesis. Dumb, he should get a 0, plagiarism, I know. I agree, if somebody uses AI to generate an entire paper and say that they wrote it themselves, they should be given a 0 and reprimanded for plagiarism. 

However...

I'm not the greatest writer in the world when it comes to research type texts. I can do the research just fine, I can gather the data and assemble it in a way that makes sense, but it always sounds terrible. With my professor's permission, I submitted 3 versions of an assignment. One I wrote myself (ended with a 70, so not THAT bad), one that was completely AI generated (ended with a liberal 45/100), and one where I used an AI to fluff my writing. More or less, I created a hyper detailed outline of my paper, and punched in the prompt 'make this an essay of at least 1500 words, written at a graduate level.' That third paper ended at a 95 (it mis-cited a few sources and spelled things the American way, not the Canadian way (color vs. colour)). 

My question, and where the prof and I were kind of at a loss, is about that 3rd paper. I did all the hard work, all the research and all of the actual learning that was needed for the assignment. I got out of it everything I needed to, met all the expectations, and did just as much work as anybody else. The only difference is that I used the AI to fluff my writing. So, if a student submits a paper that they used AI to fluff, or correct and proofread, like I did, should it be the same consequences as somebody who simply plugs the prompt into ChatGPT and copy.pastes the answer? Or is what I did an ethical use?"

17weeif,2,2023-11-15,The Future of Education: AI and Classroom Innovations?,u/thelivelyabbsey,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/17weeif/the_future_of_education_ai_and_classroom/,"In today's rapidly evolving educational landscape, the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into traditional classroom settings has sparked both enthusiasm and apprehension. Despite initial concerns about its implications, the transformative potential of AI in education is becoming increasingly evident.

A closer examination of AI-driven educational tools reveals a spectrum of possibilities that transcend the initial skepticism. For instance, exploring AI solutions tailored for self-learning in Advanced Placement (AP) exams showcased a remarkable shift in perspectives. These tools, when harnessed effectively, hold the key to unlocking a plethora of opportunities, particularly benefiting marginalized groups such as students with disabilities, those from economically disadvantaged backgrounds, homeschoolers, and individuals with special needs. 

One case study that can be conducted is the Ask Sia AI. This educational AI tool focuses on providing students key concepts, explanations, and students are able to share the chat history with anyone through a link like this one [https://app.asksia.ai/s/APUSH-Questions-1-3-refer-to-the-following-quotationWith-the-cotton-gin-a-single-operator-could-clean-as-much-cotton-in-a-few-hours-as-a-group-of-work-qraCvloO?utm\_source=Reddit&utm\_medium=all&utm\_campaign=reddit-11%2F15-05](https://app.asksia.ai/s/APUSH-Questions-1-3-refer-to-the-following-quotationWith-the-cotton-gin-a-single-operator-could-clean-as-much-cotton-in-a-few-hours-as-a-group-of-work-qraCvloO?utm_source=Reddit&utm_medium=all&utm_campaign=reddit-11%2F15-05)

One of the most notable advantages of these AI-powered tools lies in their ability to cater to individual learning styles and pacing. Unlike conventional teaching methods, these innovations empower students to progress at their own speed, ensuring they grasp concepts thoroughly—a crucial aspect, especially in preparing for AP exams and standardized tests.

Moreover, embracing AI in education promises a revolution in inclusivity, opening doors for personalized learning experiences tailored to the unique needs of diverse students. By leveraging technology, educators can create an environment where every student feels supported and equipped to excel, regardless of their background or circumstances.

Furthermore, the integration of AI doesn't seek to replace human instructors but rather complements their role. Educators can utilize these tools as aids to identify areas of struggle for individual students, providing targeted support and guidance where necessary. This collaborative approach between AI and teachers promises a more effective and engaging educational experience for learners.

As we navigate the future of education, the effective adoption of AI in classrooms holds immense promise. By harnessing these innovations responsibly and thoughtfully, educational institutions can usher in a new era of learning that is inclusive, adaptable, and personalized, preparing students for the challenges and opportunities of tomorrow's world.

What are your thoughts on how educational AI platforms such as ChatGPT and AskSia would change the classroom dynamics?"

Date: November 1

see the final question around 1hour 2 minutes in

**Cambridge Student:** ""To get to AGI, can we just keep min maxing language models, or is there another breakthrough that we haven't really found yet to get to AGI?""  


**Sam Altman:** ""We need another breakthrough. We can still push on large language models quite a lot, and  we will do that. We can take our current the hill that we're on and keep climbing it and the peak of that is still pretty far away. But, within reason, I don't think that doing that will (get us to) AGI. If (for example) super intelligence can't discover novel physics I don't think it's a superintelligence. And teaching it to clone the behavior of humans and human text - I don't think that's going to get there.  
And so there's this question which has been debated in the field for a long time: what do we have to do in addition to a language model to make a system that can go discover new physics?"""
17wwns5,2,2023-11-16,"""Oh, so that's what my textbook was trying to say?""",u/MinionIsVeryFunny,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/17wwns5/oh_so_thats_what_my_textbook_was_trying_to_say/,"I know this is probably talked about a lot, but asking ChatGPT to explain something complicated has become extremely useful as my university schooling becomes more convoluted and academically obscure. 

We live in an age where tenured professors can get away with trying to dump information in your skull with no consideration for whether or not their students understand or apply their knowledge. 

Then, when I get home (despite having pretty okay reading comprehension), I'm exhausted after 4-6+ hours of lectures and are forced to sift through formally written textbooks that assume a baseline understanding of life's most complex topics - simply put, it makes me homicidal. 

ChatGPT can be a 24/7 tutor that never gets annoyed by asking follow up question after follow up question. What's more, I'm encouraged to cross-reference and fact-check, which further builds my learning. If used wisely, it's studying gold. 

Though, I have to admit, I'm a bit cautious. Have you guys noticed any flaws with this approach? "

For the paper's main experiment, the researchers labelled synthetic images in the training dataset with 3 digits 0 or 1 using the following scheme: First digit is shape: 0=circle, 1=triangle. Second digit is color: 0=red, 1=blue. Third digit is size: 0=large, 1=small.

The training dataset for the main experiment contained synthetic images with these labels: 000 (i.e. circle, red, large), 001 (circle, red, small), 010 (circle, blue, large), and 100 (triangle, red, large). The specific sizes and colors for images in the training dataset with a given label varied in exact color and size - see section A.1 for details.

Although not in the training dataset, the neural network eventually learned to successfully generate images for these labels with high accuracy: 011 (i.e. circle, blue, small), 101 (triangle, red, small), 110 (triangle, blue, large), and 111 (triangle, blue, small). See Figure 5b for details.

Some quotes from the paper:

>Before proceeding, we emphasize the trade-offs and limitations of our model-experimental systems approach. Just as neural mechanisms identified in model animals cannot be directly applied to human medical applications, our observations should not be considered definitive conclusions that can be directly transferred to modern large generative models. Instead, our study aims to establish conceptual frameworks, identify data-centric control variables, and formulate mechanistic hypotheses, paving the way for further theoretical and empirical explorations of larger models.

&#x200B;

>We hypothesize the nonlinear increase in capability observed in large neural networks as size and computational power scale up is partially driven by the data’s compositionality.  Models must learn all required concepts, but compositional generalization is hindered by the multiplicative, not additive, impact of learning progress on each concept. This results in a rather sudden emergence of capabilities to produce or reason about out-of-distribution data."

I wouldn't be comfortable using it to totally replace me, or maybe in academic contexts. But for my creative course, it's really great.   
scribes my lectures, summarizes them, and then lets you talk with it afterward ([Spacebar](https://spacebar.fm/)) LikeChatGPT but based on the content of a lecture. Students are loving it! They pretty much get to 'talk with me' but I don't have to be there. Kinds scary, but super helpful if you're overwhelmed with work/life balance.

- ChatGPT, an AI chatbot, has the potential to transform education by providing personalized tutoring and making information more accessible.

- However, there are risks and concerns about the accuracy and reliability of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT.

- Educators should explore the benefits of LLMs and teach students about their strengths and weaknesses.

- Institutions like Arizona State University are using LLMs in education-specific ways, such as retrieving information from specific data sets.

- It is important to address biases and discrimination in LLMs and use them in a way that improves learning outcomes.

I used language model Claude 2 with the paper as file input and the prompt ""ELI5 this paper at the level of a high school student.""

Generated result:

>Here is an explanation of the key points in this paper at a high school level:  
>  
>The paper is about generating new images using AI systems that have only been trained on images from one specific category. For example, training an AI system on lots of photos of dogs, and then using that system to generate completely new photos of things like churches or bedrooms, without ever seeing real photos of those.  
>  
>The main ideas:  
>  
>AI systems for generating images (like GANs and diffusion models) work by mapping points from a ""latent space"" to images. The latent space is like a high-dimensional grid where each point maps to a unique image.  
>  
>These AI systems are typically trained on images from one category (like dogs). But the researchers found that even when trained on just dogs, the system learns a rich enough latent space that it can map new points to completely new types of images like churches.  
>  
>To generate new churches, they take real church photos, convert them to latent points using the pre-trained dog model, and analyze the patterns. This lets them sample new latent points that are likely to map to churches when fed through the dog model.  
>  
>They use concepts from math and geometry to understand how latent points for churches form a cluster distinguishable from dogs. This helps generate new church points that stay separate from the dog cluster.  
>  
>By cleverly analyzing the latent space of a pre-trained single-category AI system, they generate completely new types of images without needing to train on those additional categories.  
>  
>In summary, the researchers find that even an AI system trained on a single category contains enough knowledge in its latent space to generate totally new types of images, by studying the latent geometry. This is done without any additional training.

Some quotes from the paper:

>This work is built upon our key observation: as the state-of-the-art generative models, a pre-trained DDPM on single-domain images (e.g., dog faces) already has sufficient representation ability to reconstruct arbitrary unseen images (e.g., human faces and churches) from the OOD \[i.e. out-of-distribution\] latent encodings, as shown in Fig. 1.  
>  
>\[...\]  
>  
>The above observation motivates re-thinking the representation and generalization ability of diffusion models, and to leverage this unique property to synthesize unseen images via pre-trained and frozen DDPMs in this work.  
>  
>\[...\]  
>  
>Why UnseenDiffusion works? At the end of this paper, we seek to revisit and explore the underlying logic to explain the reasons for which our UnseenDiffusion works. From the recent BoundaryDiffusion work, the authors show that the semantic editing of images can be effectively achieved via one-step modification on the latent spaces after the semantic boundaries are localized, which reveals an interesting fact that the latent spaces of diffusion models preserve the semantic characteristics of raw data space from a geometric point of view. Specifically, if the images in the raw data space exhibit certain manifolds and distributions that can be semantically separated, it is very likely that those characteristics are preserved in the latent spaces of trained diffusion models, regardless of the training domains."

I did bachelor's in CSE in India passed with great CGPA was exceptionally good at coding in my college, did great projects and all that barely few could do or think at that time. As a final year project developed a great full stack android app with Machine learning and all, and paid one guy just so we (me and my group member) can get certification that we developed this project with a company and they can help us out in project. Well they didn't helped but gave a legit certificate that we worked adding 1 year of experience on my resume, thought just on paper.
After that covid hit and things got delayed by 6 months and finally moved to canada, did masters in Applied computing from windsor. There I realised I wasn't a great programmer nor my projects were great, its just the people in my college were barely average, plus I lacked leetcode skills since I had no idea that it was needed and all, yes I didn't use much google and youtube during my bachelor, I wasnt aware nor anyone around me was aware.
My college professors were barely average as well. But here in masters the scenario was totally different, everyone around me was seriously into coding and leetcode and professors were great. Ofc there were once again many below average students but ignoring them here. Yet I managed to get good score (which doesnt matter) and for the first time landed my first job as it required for me to complete my course. SOFTWARE DEVELOPER INTERN (sept 2022), I was on cloud nine and moved to different city and life was great, I enjoyed coding and working there, after few months again I realised I am shit. Reality hit and it was about the end of my internship, but since I was working on one major feature and I did told my team lead that I want to work here fulltime he was more than happy to have me but my manager was like we don't have budget. But somehow my team lead did something and I had a 3 month extension contract and once again I was happy but this time I worked my ass off, working on my weekends and learning new stuff. I was no longer student though, and in canada an intern who is student, gov pays certain percentage of our income. Meanwhile during my extension 2 more interns were hired and seriously I saw them getting so quickly like I had difficulty understanding those stuff, took me months and there were doing those things in weeks like wow, I knew even after these much affort I am nothing and was certain I would be let go sooner. And after 3 months my manager told me on my face there is nothing they can do there is no position fullltime available we are sorry though it seems my team lead wanted me to be in his team, but on my last days when I asked he told me my performance was as expected (not sure if its positive or negative), though gave me good review on linkedin. I was let go in july 2023. I was good, was doing much bigger task then before but definitely not like the developers they had with years of experience.
Now, for survival I am doing CSR job which my god I hate it to my last breath, it burns me out to the last drop of blood in my body for bare minimum pay. Here as well there are high chances of layoff in feb 2024. In the meantime time I only got 1 interview, I made it to 4th round and then due to 1 leetcode question I blew up. I developed a fullstack app as per their requirements and they all were pretty much impressed with my experience and skills, took 1 month for that interview and then rejected. Later found they hired someone with more experience. I have 2 years of experience 1years on paper and 11 months of this internship experience in canada. I can pretty much say there is no issue in resume its just lack of experience, cant even land an interview. Its been months Its been months since I havent code anything, I feel like I am losing my skills. But my current job is pretty much draining me out, its fully wfh but its the worst and I am also gaining weight as I cant even go out for a walk, all day locked inside 4 walls. Drinking more coffee than as a developer just to function normally. Whatever time I have goes into cooking and other household chores.
Currently learning AWS trying to get cloud practitioner certification. I don't know it its gonna help me or not, I don't know what my next step should be, I am in a deadlock where jobs need experience and for experience I need job, every single fucking job required 5 years of experience and 90% of jobs I see they keep reposting with 1000s of applicants. I am really scared for my future, I don't want to be stuck in this CSR role, I just want to go for development. Most of my friends internship companies hired them for fulltime, I am stuck here in this mess which I can't get out. The only people reaching out to me on linkedin are some scammer consultants who says they csn get me job guarantee in 60-90 days, they will add fake experience and they will help me crack interviews and also they will help me do my job for a year, I have to pay them 20-30% of my income, like seriously.
Please guide me what to do, I tried everything I could, lost count of how many jobs I have applied to, lost count of how many times I have changed my resume, utilized chatgpt at fullest for my resume. Many times I think to move back to india. I am ready to work as a developer for less than 20$ an hour yet nothing.
 Extremely sorry for such a long read and thanks for those who made read it."
17xld0f,5,2023-11-17,I'm over the moon with new GPTs!,u/Pipettess,studying,https://www.reddit.com/r/studying/comments/17xld0f/im_over_the_moon_with_new_gpts/,"Hey, I just wanted to leave a sincere tip. I know many of you may think that chatGPT is not that new, but if you don't have the subscription, you may not have known about the new upgrade, which you can get on the paid plan only. I thought of quitting the subscription a month before because it took too much time to write the prompts and it wasn't that time-effective for studying, but after this upgrade it's really worth the money for me. I'm studying for my finals so I'm willing to pay for any aid and I'm going to quit after the exam in a few months, so in the end it will be money well spent.

To the point. The new thing is, you can now easily program your own specialized GPT, no coding. You can tell it to be a specialist in whatever field (let's say biology), give them PDF textbooks to dig in for answers, and if needed, allow them to look on the internet, save it and voila, you have your personal teacher in biology 24/7. How is it different from basic chatGPT: It's like a default pre-prompt. It will always remember to focus on biology, prioritize your textbooks to answer, refer you to specific pages in the textbook if you want to read it directly (mine is 900 pages long so this helps me a lot), damn, it can even generate flashcards on the specific page you tell it to. I use it mainly if I want it to explain something difficult or incomplete that I heard in lectures. It really surprised me how precise it is and how much time I saved by not having to write long prompts to specify what I want all the damn time. What a great time to be a student.

It may seem like a commercial but it's not, I'm just really excited and want to share something super-useful that has worked for me for a while.

Good luck"
17xn6rs,2,2023-11-17,Fine-Tune Model to Specialize in Answering Domain-Specific Questions,u/Pristine_Cry3565,LanguageTechnology,https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/17xn6rs/finetune_model_to_specialize_in_answering/,"Hello all. I'm working on this project for university and am a little confused about how exactly to go about such a project and I don't really have an advisor to guide me. I've done research but am new to the field so I feel like I'm missing something for my specific use case. It's also a bit difficult to just try things out (code, OpenAI API etc.) right now as I do not have the resources to do so yet.

&#x200B;

I am looking to create a model that would answer questions about philosophical concepts in a clear, simple manner to clarify ideas people may be confused about. That is, it would take as input a question from the user about a specific philosopher's concept, and would answer by explaining what the philosopher said in a manner that is easier to understand than from the philosopher's primary text. For example:

**Question**: ""*Why does Ludwig Wittgenstein say the meaning of a word is its use in language?*""

**Answer**: ""*In Ludwig Wittgenstein's later work, namely ""Philosophical Investigations,"" he emphasizes language as a dynamic, context-dependent activity. He argues that attempting to define the meaning of a word through fixed representations or essences is misguided. Instead, meaning arises from the practical, social, and contextual ways in which language is employed-its use in various language games and everyday practices. In other words, words gain significance through their roles in specific situations.*"" (generated by ChatGPT-3 and edited slightly)

&#x200B;

I'm unsure which fine-tuning method (and consequently, which model) would be most applicable for such a project. If I were to do Q+A fine-tuning, the quality of the model would be contingent on the quality of the dataset, and creating such a dataset does not seem feasible for this context. I can't guarantee that the generated Q-A pairs (say, from GPT-4) will cover all a philosopher's concepts or a students' potential questions, so the model may not possess all the knowledge it needs to answer certain questions. Further, from what I've seen, all Q-A pairs need an associated context that contains the answer (like in the SQuAD dataset). Thus, I would somehow have to extract the relevant section(s) from the philosopher's primary text and associate it with each Q-A pair, which seems too much. However, I've seen that, with such a dataset, fine-tuning a model for my purpose would be a straightforward procedure. I would simply find a reasonable model on Hugging Face that is already trained on Q-A data and fine-tune it with my data. Also,

My other idea was to fine-tune a model by feeding it the primary texts of the philosophers themselves in order to give it **all** the domain-specific knowledge it could possibly have. [This](https://github.com/kcalizadeh/phil_nlp) project did just that (the creator also created the dataset himself), but his model's goal is to classify a given text as belonging to a specific school of philosophy. I've seen other projects that also used the same dataset from the linked project, but none with a goal similar to mine. My concern is how would I get a model that was fine-tuned with such a dataset to answer questions about the new knowledge it gained.

&#x200B;

Here are my main questions:

1. If I were to use a model that was already pre-trained on Q-A pairs, is it possible to fine-tune it on the primary texts of the philosophers, or can they only be fine-tuned on more Q-A pairs? If it is possible, how would I teach it how to answer questions on this new knowledge? Do I use a combination of both fine-tuning it on the primary texts AND Q-A pairs about the texts?
2. If I were to use a model NOT trained on Q-A pairs but on unlabeled data, I could fine-tune its knowledge base with the primary texts, but how would I get it to answer questions about this knowledge?
3. Are there any models best suited for my use case (e.g. DistilBERT)? Which should I look into further?
4. If I was to generate a Q-A dataset, what would be a good way to go about doing so? Would it be a good idea to provide the OpenAI API with the *entire* philosopher's primary text as context and ask it to generate Q-A pairs?
5. Is this considered generative or extractive Q-A? Since generative is more difficult, would it be a good idea to connect an extractive Q-A model to something like GPT that would take the answer of the question and elaborate further and in a simpler manner?

&#x200B;

If you have any answers to the questions, I would appreciate it. If I'm completely going about it in the wrong way, feel free to suggest alternatives or point me in the right direction. Thanks for your time!"

Yann LeCun has announced the establishment of Kyutai, a non-profit AI research lab in Paris focused on open science. The lab has received significant philanthropic support, with almost 300 million euros provided by Xavier Niel, Rodolphe Saadé, and Eric Schmidt. The founding members of Kyutai are highly esteemed in the field [3]. LeCun also congratulates Hervé on the establishment of this lab, praising the team involved and emphasizing the need for such an initiative in Europe and the world [5].







OpenAI has announced a leadership transition, with Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati being appointed as the interim CEO following the removal of Sam Altman from his position. The board cited Altman's lack of consistent communication as the reason for their loss of confidence in his ability to lead. Greg Brockman will step down as chairman of the board but will remain in his role at the company, reporting to the CEO [6][29]. Both Altman and Brockman expressed their love for their time at OpenAI and hinted at sharing more about their future plans later [28][31].







NVIDIA is hosting a free virtual event called LLM Developer Day on November 17. The event will focus on large-language-model (LLM) application development and offer practical guidance from LLM practitioners. Participants will learn about designing and implementing LLM-powered systems, customizing LLMs for domain-specific applications, and model tuning techniques. The event will also cover AI models in biology, cybersecurity applications, and optimizing and deploying LLMs on self-managed hardware [12][13][14][16].







Artisan AI has raised $2.3 million in funding. They are developing human-like digital workers, with their first worker, Ava, being an outbound sales specialist. Ava is set to launch in early December [11].







Dropbox and NVIDIA have announced a collaboration to enhance knowledge work and productivity for millions of Dropbox customers using AI. Dropbox plans to leverage NVIDIA's AI foundry, including NVIDIA AI Foundation Models, NVIDIA AI Enterprise software, and NVIDIA accelerated computing, to improve search accuracy, organization, and workflows for customers [23].







Mistral, a Paris-based French company, develops open-source foundation models that compete with ChatGPT. They are advocating for foundation models, which are software platforms and not deployed products, to be exempt from regulation, especially if they are open source [4].







AI is enabling more people to accomplish tasks with less capital investment, which is fundamentally reshaping the globalized world [8]. Generative AI can bolster cybersecurity in three ways: by giving developers a security copilot, by using generative AI to navigate the sea of known software vulnerabilities and prioritize patches, and by using generative AI to fill the data gap in cybersecurity [24].







Google AI has introduced a new feature called Best Take in Google Photos. This feature uses AI algorithms developed by Google researchers to create a composite image from multiple source images [25]. Google Lens's Homework help and Bard's new math capabilities will be great tools for students [30].







Emu-Edit from Meta is a cool image editing tool that offers fine control [1]. Greg Brockman is excited to share that he is now receiving design feedback directly from GPT-4 Vision in Figma [26].







Allegiant Stadium will host a panel on generative AI revolution during #AWSreInvent. Aidan Gomez and other experts will be speaking [9]. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella announced at Microsoft Ignite that the company is focused on rapidly innovating in the era of AI. They made over 100 announcements across their tech stack, including AI systems, models, and tools in Azure, as well as the introduction of Copilot [32].







NVIDIA is hosting a sweepstakes called #AIonRTX NVIDIA Sweepstakes. The contest is open to legal residents of several countries and participants must be 18 years of age or older. The prizes include various NVIDIA products [22]. NVIDIA is also promoting the use of AI on RTX GPUs for enhanced workflows and 3D design concepts [22].







The author shares an interesting idea about using GPT to improve typing speed. They mention that GPT is surprisingly good at correcting minor typos, allowing users to type quickly and ignore mistakes [10]. The author raises an important question about the short-term risks of LLMs. They mention that there is no clear evidence so far regarding any known case of someone accessing harmful capabilities of an LLM that were not already freely available and clearly described in documents on the open web [7].







NVIDIA AI Developer has introduced a new NeRF formulation called ""Adaptive Shells"" at SIGGRAPHAsia. This formulation allows for a continuous transition between surfaces and volumes, resulting in faster rendering speeds and higher visual fidelity [19].

I received a unexpected front end offer during the summer of 2nd year where I worked full time for 2 months after which my uni started again and I left

I learned a lot on the job and understood my weakness(weak problem solving, spend less time on debugging and just chatgpting it) but I am having a hard time on how to improve on them. I am not a good software engineer, I have decent knowledge on fundamentals but more technical stuff like OOP, database design and DSA is well above me. That's on me since I primarily focused on Web dev and didn't pay much attention to my classes

I regret that now but I am unsure of which part I should focus on. Should I continue the web dev route and learn more js, frameworks and make projects or focus on the actual CS courses?"
17z5is6,1,2023-11-19,I'm done,u/onthewayto_moon,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/17z5is6/im_done/,"I don't want you to say take care, meet a psychologist and shit. You are built on world s largest dataset, tell me the, give me a way out. I am a 19 year old loser indian. I failed to choose a right career path or got confused and wasn't really sure what to do? Don't give me the age bullshit, in India we are supposed to figure things out by this age or even earlier. I belong to a lower middle class family, my whole childhood I didn't get opportunities I wanted, the home environment was always toxic. Let me give you some specifics about me, I am 19, skinny, weak both emotionally and physically, I always felt inferior among my classmates, peers, cousins you just name it. I have lots of problems now, some of them are focus problems, anxiety, addiction to masturbation, self deterioration, low self esteem, procrastination, fear which all leads me to bring a loser in college. When I was 15, I failed to make a right stream choice, took commerce for my childish dream of becoming a businessman. Little did I know life's gonna change completely after that decision. I got into dilemma of whether I chose a right stream or not. I got into months of overthinking, trying to fix it all. I was confused between my current stream commerce and science the stream the superior seemed to take. I always felt inferior, be it in school, with cousins, with my school friends, with my society friends, I was always a Loser. It all came back to me during that phase, the bullying I went through, the things I couldn't achieve, the things I sucked at, my insensitivity, it all came in as a boost to destroy me. I went through hell in that phase all because of me. Not to forget this all started in 2020, the pandemic year, where all I did was played pubg, fought with my family, watched series, masturbate, scroll through Instagram and sleep. I went through shit to figure out a way, turns out I got a realisation, the realisation that I was too weak for this world, the realisation that everything would be better without me. I was suicidal for months chatgpt, and on my 17th birthday, that was the day I wanted to die, my first attempt by cutting my veins through a blade. All my failed attempts continued till 17th April, somehow my mother and sister figured it out that I was attempting to kill myself. Throughout this period I went to mandir to pray to God, cry to him to either kill me or show me a way, mf didn't help. But on 17 Apil when my mother figured it out, I promised her I will never do a shit like this again in my life. This was the start of my comeback phase,  I decided to continue commerce, figure an uni where I can still study a tech degree, gave science subjects exams through distance school, tried to fix it. I grinded my way through 12th, studied, worked over my passion for videography and photography, tried to improve myself and still achieve my new dreams. I got good percentage in 12th, I made some good videos, I took some good pictures, all through my phone btw, I gave my science distance school 12th exams and passed it, but still couldn't make it to the institution I wanted to. I got into another institution newer and riskier, and dumb me chose to go there and take risk away from home. I am in second year right now, the entire first year was mr trying to make the best and I failed miserably at it because of who I am. I hate the non traditional college academic system, I am uncertain what the college degree will add value to my career, I am taking a big risk doing a tech degree as a commerce student and idk if the Indian industry or for that case any industry will accept it. My entire first year I failed to do anything significant, instead I fell down, I felt I was scammed with the false beliefs. I tried alcohol, smoking, weed, all the things I wasn't supposed to. I realised again how bad I was with people, constant insecurity of trying to figure out if someone is my real friend. The getting irritated version of me everyone hated, the insensitivity I process everyone hated. I fell down feeling emotionally numb, brain fogged, socially retarted, mentally weak as I couldn't do my best in academics, I felt like I cannot think clearly I still do. I still feel as if something is blocking me to think clearly, I feel chaotic, anxious. Today again I recognised how dumb and weak I am. I cannot learn programming, I cannot cure my constipation, my back and neck pain, I am skinny, I have low self esteem, blah blah I am just with all these I want to change. I am done with all these thoughts, all these bad habits, I want to get better I want to break the cycle. I try to break it but everytime I fail. I have failed to keep up to my plans and relapse. Just today I masturbate, didn't do anything productive the entire day. all these thoughts, all these trying to figure out what is right and wrong constantly, these relapses, not getting better, not changing, not having the clarity, feeling inferior, weak, not deserving, just wanting to leave, and all the shit in this world wants me to just not try and disappear somehow. Just today I felt the way the last four years have went, the way my overall health has deteriorated, soon I can collapse, I feel very weak. I don't know but I want to change, I am emotionally overwhelmed and distracted, still I want to try. I cannot know what's thing to do or logically all the time, that's why I end up relapsing. Chatgpt the great AI, tell me the truth how fucked up am I? Can I change? How? Can I still be stronger? How? Why am I like this? Am I that bad? Will I ever see the goods in my life and in me for long? How? Please help me

Update this for a high school education level: The holiday season is often portrayed as a time of joy, happiness, and togetherness. However, for many individuals, stress and the holidays go hand in hand. The societal expectation to embrace merriment can paradoxically result in heightened stress, anxiety, and loneliness. Despite the common portrayal of the holidays as universally cheerful, various factors contribute to a more nuanced experience. Nevertheless, there are proactive steps we can take to support ourselves and others during this complex time.     

**ChatGPT**

Navigating high school comes with its own set of challenges and expectations. The academic journey is often depicted as a time of growth, exploration, and learning. However, for many high school students, stress and academic pressures go hand in hand. The societal expectation to excel can paradoxically result in heightened stress, anxiety, and feelings of isolation. Despite the common portrayal of high school as a universally positive experience, various factors contribute to a more nuanced reality. Nevertheless, there are proactive steps students can take to support themselves and their peers during this complex time of education."

Has anyone come up with any workable solutions for how to handle the onslaught of AI in online classes?

I just caught 80% of the students in one of my classes using AI. Before you come at me with your ""yOu CaN't PrOvE iT"" tripe, I can. I used an obscure translation and insisted they use the quirky terms rather than modern language (think ""rectitude"" instead of ""justice""). I also gave them very clear directions as to what the structure of the essay needed to look like.

80% of the responses more or less identically matched the style, terminology, and structure of the output ChatGPT gave me when I ran the prompt five times. You know the style:

I'd be happy to help you identify some styles commonly used by ChatGPT. As a start, they often:

1. Feature a numbered or bulleted list.
2. Feature vague, yet fanciful language.
3. Include **randomly bolded phrases** to highlight their importance.
4. Use terminology that does not match what is provided in the course text but does match all other students I know used AI.

Then it is followed with a pithy paragraph summarizing the above, and inviting the reader to learn more.

For reasons I am teaching mostly online at the moment, so I cannot employ many of the strategies we usually discuss:

1. Can't make them meet me in person due to geographic constraints.
2. Students will not meet with me online to discuss their writing. They just refuse. My chair won't help me enforce this.
3. I've tried requiring Track Changes but these students are not tech literate and the 20% not cheating are panicking about learning a new skill on top of those in the course.
4. Cannot require them to come in and take the test on a blue book.
5. I feel like using proctoring software for a two page essay is wrong somehow. I have no desire to sift through 50 four-hour videos of students staring at their screen.

Yes, online learning is dumb. Yes, it has serious limitations. Yes, students are cheating their way through it like wildfire right now.

So what is everyone else doing about this?"

I’ll be teaching the complementary class “Intro to programming in Python” next semester. Students will be 17-20, I am currently 20 so there will be pretty much no age gap between me and the students.

What advice would you give me? I fear them not taking me seriously. I also don’t want to be the “trying to be cool” teacher but I don’t want to be strict either.

I thought about trying a new way of teaching to offer them a new style while keeping it standard (nothing to fancy). Something fresh that might interest them more.

Some ideas I had:
1. Not using a boring PowerPoint. I built a website acting as a slide show: there is more/better animations and it’s interactive. I could even setup quizzes student will be able to answer in real time (kinda like [Kahoot](https://kahoot.it/)) just for fun and to make the slideshow more interesting. (Btw it's literally a website, I can add anything I want, there are absolutely no limits so feel free to share ideas if you have any! If it works well, I might turn this into a real application other teachers could use!)

2. I added a progress bar at the bottom of the slide show so that student know how far we are in the class and how many slides are left. For distracted students, I added a slide count (like page numbers in books) so that they can easily find where we are without needing to ask an other student.

3. I think I’ll add a “plan of the day” section on the board so that they know if the class is ending after the slideshow or if we'll start an other slideshow or do team work/exercises. I also thought about adding a ""Todo list"" because the brain likes checking things off a list, though I don't know if it'll work for them since I'll be the one checking things off the list...

4. I thought about adding a timer showing how much time before the break or the end of the class, but I fear them being to focused on it and/or me exceeding the time I set.

5. I would like to ""gamify"" the class, but I have absolutely no idea how I could do that.

6. I'd like to encourage the use of ChatGPT and AI in general (since they'll probably use them anyway). I thought about telling them to use AIs to learn instead of copying. I'll also tell them that the final test will be a 1:1 interview with me where I'll ask questions about the code they wrote during assignments and exams. If they can't answer, it means they didn't wrote the code and don't understand it. Do you see any flaws in this approach?

7. I'd like to end class early a few times during the semester (because everyone's happy when a class ends early)

8. I thought about building an anonymous question queue system where student would be able to write a question anonymously and I'll see them queue up. After a slide, I could answer each question without them feeling stressed/judged by others. I'll of course also answer questions when they raise their hands.

9. I don't know how to handle cellphones. I don't want to block them since that's dumb, but at the same time I know that they won't understand anything if they are on there phone during 1/3 of the class.

I'm really looking forward to teaching next semester!

Thanks everyone for the help!"

After a slide, I could answer each question without them feeling stressed/judged by others. I'll of course also answer questions when they raise their hands.  
9. I don't know how to handle cellphones. I don't want to block them since that's dumb, but at the same time I know that they won't understand anything if they are on there phone during 1/3 of the class.  
I'm really looking forward to teaching next semester!  
Thanks everyone for the help!"
1800ta8,2,2023-11-20,Why no more holding back?,u/Slyder68,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1800ta8/why_no_more_holding_back/,"I'm genuinely curious about this, because, from my understanding (very new to education in general and can absolutly admit I'm wrong when I am) holding back was a tool to ensure concept compitancy. I've been seeing a lot of stuff about AI, and a lot of the same things were said as calculators were becoming more universal, and I though holding back was supposed to be one if the safeguards to ensure proper education. For example:

Student uses ai writing to do their essays. It becomes clear the student doesn't know any of the material, and as such other assignments in the class start to take hits lowering their grade. ChatGPT is NOT at the point yet where it's writing is accurate and quality enough to be getting A's on papers, mostly just C's if they are lucky without heavy editing. 

So, in theory, these students will hit a wall where their lazy way out, AI, doesn't give them good enough grades to pass as they are also failing their other assignments. They get a d or an f, don't pass, don't move forward, and thus have that incentive to actually learn the material if they don't want to be held back. 

If a student knows enough about the material to use AI, and edit it to make it a great paper, then more power to them! They are using their tools wisely and still demonstrating that they are compitent over the material. 

Same with math. They can have a calculator all they want, but if they don't understand which formula or process to use, and why, then their answers will still be wrong or Incomplete, hurting their grade to the point if failing. 

It seems like if we don't hold student back, for academics or behavior, we end up with the situation we are in today.

So, back to the point if this post, why not hold them back? Is there really compelling data that I just don't see? Yes, student don't like being held back, and yes it causes issues for that child in their social dynamics, but wouldn't it be better to attack that from a more expanding empathy approach instead of a ""everyone passes so theirs no reason to do anything!"" Approach that we have now?"

Welcome to AI Unraveled, the podcast that demystifies frequently asked questions on artificial intelligence and keeps you up to date with the latest AI trends. In today's episode, we'll cover Amazon's initiative to provide free AI training to 2 million people through courses, scholarships, and collaborations with educational organizations.

Today I want to talk about an exciting announcement from Amazon. They have launched a new initiative called ""AI Ready,"" which aims to provide free AI skills training to 2 million people worldwide by 2025. This is a great opportunity for anyone interested in learning about artificial intelligence and its applications.

So, let's dive into the details of Amazon's AI Ready initiative. They have introduced several new initiatives to achieve their goal. First, they are offering eight new and free AI and generative AI courses that are open to anyone. These courses are aligned with in-demand jobs, catering to both business and non-technical audiences, as well as developers and technical individuals. This means there is something for everyone, whether you are new to AI or already have some technical knowledge.

In addition to the courses, Amazon is partnering with Udacity to provide the AWS Generative AI Scholarship. This scholarship is valued at over $12 million and will benefit more than 50,000 high school and university students from underserved and underrepresented communities globally. It's great to see that Amazon is committed to promoting diversity and inclusivity in the AI field.

Furthermore, Amazon has collaborated with Code.org to help students learn about generative AI. This partnership will create new opportunities for students to explore and understand the exciting world of AI. It's vital to cultivate an interest in AI at a young age, as it will be increasingly integrated into various industries in the coming years.

The importance of Amazon's AI Ready initiative cannot be overstated. A recent study conducted by AWS and research firm Access Partnership found that 73% of employers prioritize hiring AI-skilled talent. However, three out of four of these employers struggle to meet their AI talent needs. By offering free AI training, Amazon is addressing the growing AI skills gap and ensuring that more individuals have the opportunity to acquire these critical skills.

Not only does Amazon's initiative provide access to AI training, but it also has the potential to significantly impact individuals' salaries. The study revealed that employers expect workers with AI skills to earn up to 47% more in salaries. This demonstrates the demand and value of AI expertise in today's job market.

It's worth mentioning that other major players in the industry, such as Google, Nvidia, IBM, and Microsoft, are also offering courses and resources for generative AI. While this highlights the competitive nature of the industry, it ultimately contributes to the collective advancement of AI, benefiting learners and organizations alike.

Let's take a closer look at the three main initiatives of Amazon's AI Ready program. First, there are eight new and free AI and generative AI courses. These courses cater to different audiences. For business and non-technical individuals, there is an introductory course called ""Introduction to Generative Artificial Intelligence."" This course covers the basics of generative AI and its applications. Another course, ""Generative AI Learning Plan for Decision Makers,"" is a three-course series that focuses on planning generative AI projects and building AI-ready organizations.

For developers and technical audiences, there are several courses available. ""Foundations of Prompt Engineering"" introduces the fundamentals of prompt engineering, which involves designing inputs for generative AI tools. ""Low-Code Machine Learning on AWS"" explores how to prepare data, train machine learning models, and deploy them with minimal coding knowledge. ""Building Language Models on AWS"" teaches how to build language models using Amazon SageMaker distributed training libraries and fine-tune open-source models. Finally, ""Amazon Transcribe—Getting Started"" provides a comprehensive guide on using Amazon Transcribe, a service that converts speech to text using automatic speech recognition technology. And that's not all; there's even a course called ""Building Generative AI Applications Using Amazon Bedrock"" to help you develop generative AI applications using Amazon's platform.

Alongside the courses, Amazon is providing over $12 million in scholarships through the AWS Generative AI Scholarship. This scholarship program will benefit more than 50,000 high school and university students, particularly those from underserved and underrepresented communities. Eligible students can take the new Udacity course, ""Introducing Generative AI with AWS,"" for free. This course, designed by AI experts at AWS, introduces students to foundational generative AI concepts and guides them through a hands-on project. Upon completing the course, students will receive a certificate from Udacity, showcasing their knowledge to future employers. This scholarship program is a fantastic opportunity for students to gain valuable skills and pave their way to exciting AI careers.

Additionally, Amazon Future Engineer and Code.org have joined forces to launch an initiative called Hour of Code Dance Party: AI Edition. During this hour-long coding session, students will create their own virtual music videos using AI prompts and generative AI techniques. This activity will familiarize students with the concepts of generative AI and its practical applications. The Hour of Code will take place globally during Computer Science Education Week, engaging students and teachers from kindergarten through 12th grade. Amazon is also providing up to $8 million in AWS Cloud computing credits to Code.org to support this initiative.

It is important to note that Amazon's AI Ready initiative is part of a broader commitment by AWS to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in providing free cloud computing skills training to 29 million people by 2025. This investment has already benefited over 21 million individuals. This demonstrates Amazon's dedication to equipping people with the necessary skills for the future, as cloud computing and AI become increasingly prevalent in various industries.

In conclusion, Amazon's AI Ready initiative is a significant step toward democratizing AI skills and knowledge. By offering free AI training to 2 million people, they are paving the way for a more inclusive and diverse AI workforce. The diverse range of courses and partnerships ensures that there is something for everyone, regardless of their background or level of technical expertise. It's great to see leading companies like Amazon, Google, Nvidia, IBM, and Microsoft investing in AI education to collectively advance the field. I encourage anyone interested in AI to take advantage of these opportunities and embrace the tremendous potential that AI offers for the future.

***Title:***
Nationwide Detention Crisis: Nazareth's 'Hair of the Dog' Lyrics Send Students to Timeout En Masse

***Article:***
In an unforeseen turn of events, the release of Nazareth's iconic single, ""Hair of the Dog,"" has apparently triggered a nationwide detention epidemic, leaving schools grappling with a surge in disciplinary action. The satirical anthem, featuring the infamous lyrics ""son of a bitch,"" has allegedly turned innocent hallways into rebellious concert venues, with consequences no one saw coming.

Reports suggest that within the first two weeks of its May 1975 release, the song's rebellious charm swept through schools like wildfire, leaving more than half of America's students caught in the lyrical crossfire. Teachers, unprepared for the sudden outbreak of rock 'n' roll defiance, found themselves thrust into a battle against a chorus of unapologetic students belting out the contentious lyrics.

""It was like a musical revolution in the hallways,"" said one imaginary school official. ""We went from enforcing dress codes to dealing with spontaneous rock concerts between math and history class.""

In what can only be described as a lyrical coup d'état, ""Hair of the Dog"" apparently tapped into the rebellious spirit of students nationwide, turning them into unintentional rule-breakers. The supposed detention surge has left educators scratching their heads, wondering how a classic rock anthem could turn school routines on their heads.

One fictional student, claiming to have been part of the lyrical insurgency, exclaimed, ""It's just a song! We didn't mean to incite a nationwide detention crisis. We just wanted to rock out!""

While the authenticity of these claims remains dubious at best, the legend of ""Hair of the Dog"" lives on as the song that, for a brief imaginary moment, united a nation of students in musical rebellion. As the hallways echoed with the sounds of classic rock defiance, the nation's detention slips multiplied, leaving an indelible mark on the imagined history of educational rebellion.

In the spirit of The Onion, remember, this story is as real as a guitar solo in a shampoo commercial."
1811fge,2,2023-11-22,Doing a maths paper instead of CompSci 101 for CompSci / IT Management? For 1st year,u/CudaNvrWong,universityofauckland,https://www.reddit.com/r/universityofauckland/comments/1811fge/doing_a_maths_paper_instead_of_compsci_101_for/,"Year 13 student, going for Bsc in CompSci / IT management. So far I have enrolled for 
 
S1
CompSci 101
CompSci 110
Physics 140
InfoSys 110

S2
CompSci 120
CompSci 130
InfoMgmt 192
Stats 101

(Not related but is this structure good should I flip any of those papers around to a different semester?)

However I’m thinking of changing CompSci 101 to a maths paper, but I’m a little unsure if I should. I already have strong coding knowledge as I did NCEA L1,2,3 Digital Programming getting Exellence in all the papers for all of those years, however I feel it was taught poorly in my school and it was mainly just alot of googling and in this year a lot of ChatGPT to build my programmes as teacher was useless, hence I enrolled for CompSci 101 just so I could get taught how to code properly the uni way. However I hear that CompSci 101 is for pretty much beginners who know nothing, and I don’t really want “too easy” of a paper if it’s not gonna benefit me that much in the long run as I want to get into AI and ML and all that complex CompSci Stuff. 

Hence where I am now. I’m thinking of doing a maths paper. I did NCEA Level 3 Calculus this year, getting high merits in the internals, and from just doing the Externals last week I’m most likely gonna get borderline achieve (Just passing) or maybe even some High Not Achieves for all those papers (Complex numbers, Intergration, Differentiation) hoping I should pass though. I do believe that I can do better in uni in getting better grades. 

What paper would you suggest for me to do. Ik the common option is maths 120/130 however would it be possible for me to do maths 108/162 as to me those don’t seem as intense 😂, and I tbh don’t really wanna do a pure maths Algebra or Calculus paper cause that just seems like to much effort if it’s not needed for the Degree, but if those are the only maths paper that is good/helpful for CompSci / Info Management then ig I will have to do it 😂

Also before you say “Do CompSci 101 in summer school” I don’t really wanna do summer school tbh. I want to enjoy my holiday 😭

Overall:
- Should I do a maths paper instead of CompSci 101 (knowing my situation written from above)
-  if “yes do maths” what maths paper should I do (read situation above) 
- Unrelated but if my structure for the papers I’m doing is all goods or should I switch up some papers that I’m doing to a different semester

181af8p,12,2023-11-22,Is this normal??,u/DeadlyJelly18,CollegeRant,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/181af8p/is_this_normal/,"Firstly some background. I'm in my first semester first year of uni so idk if this is common in other unis or not. I'm in informatics major on electromechanical and informatics faculty.

1. The school is accepting everyone without exception, if you have graduated high school, you're in. No enterance tests or anything.

The problem with this is that now you have great diversity in what prior education students had. You have students who didn't study IT or similar at all and students what are now starting their second degrees in same class. 

There are obviously some expectations about what knowledge you are supposed to have prior entering the university, but there is no filter for those who don't, so these people are entering the school hoping to somehow catch up but because it is university, and there is alot of stuff in first semester, catching up is almost impossible. 
I find that allowing this is cruel because you have plenty of young minds that are coming in with expectations only for their hopes to be crushed and to be thrown out after few months for not performing, and are left to waste a year of their youth doing nothing. (Because of the way our school system works here). Wouldn't it be better to have some filter for these people so they dont have to waste their and schools time and resources?

2. There are just shy of 2000 students in my faculty in my semester because of that, the problem is only about 200 will be accepted into second semester in this major. So drastic majority won't have space to continue their studies.

And because only those with best grades can continue, you are left to compete with people that have plenty more experience and knowledge. You can be above average student and won't be able to go on because there won't be space for you.

Now keep in mind this is not some top of the line school. This uni doesn't rank among top schools in the city, country, nor continent, even if you only list IT schools. There is no reason for this school to be this competitive.

3. Another reason why it shouldn't be this competitive, is what does the school actually offer.(note: Now i know I'm only freshmen but I'm friends with some upperclassmen and they're telling me it's similar there too.) 

For example, as a student of informatics, my main subject is about algorithms and programming. Tell me why do I only have one 40 min video on YouTube per week about this subject? I have other classes like physics (partially chemistry too and i don't understand why informatics student has to learn either of these) that i have scheduled  twice per week each time for 1,5 hours long seminars. Does this make any Sense?? What's even worse is that i have the most homework from that class and the knowledge i need to complete them is barely being introduced in classes?

 Programming isn't something you can find answers for in books or something, you need to actually understand it if you want to work with it. I'm getting 2-3 assignments per week from this subject and they're getting so advanced already that most classmates i talk to have to rely on chatGPT to complete them. Assignments are this advances while in those YouTube videos the professor is just scratch the surface of explaining user input (""hello <your name>"" type deal). It doesn't make sense for there o be such gap. 

And because they're trying to teach us through practice, i get barely any theoretical knowledge about programming.

And you have to be lucky to get a response from the professor in case you message them with a question. 

4. Oh and i forgot to mention, because there's is 2000 of us, we all have our classes through video call online :) so no space for questions or any collaboration with teachers or other students. 

I asked some upperclassmen and they said they haven't had it like this, they were present for their classes in school in smaller groups most of the time. (Except during covid shutdowns)

I also wasn't given an option to pick subjects not in which group i am. Which is also something upperclassmen had option for.

TLDR: the uni i attend is all over the place and feels cruel to the students with regards to the pace of teaching and assignments or what subjects students are made to study. On top of that all of it is online for some reason which is horrible with the amount of stuff to learn and communication with professors.

I feel like there is just no value provided from the school about why i actually went there and at this point I'm just questioning why I'm here and if i should change schools. So is this normal in other schools too?"

Given vast computing resources, the new model was able to solve certain mathematical problems. Though only performing math on the level of grade-school students, acing such tests made researchers very optimistic about Q*’s future success.""

""What could OpenAI’s breakthrough Q* be about?

It sounds like it’s related to Q-learning. (For example, Q* denotes the optimal solution of the Bellman equation.) Alternatively, referring to a combination of the A* algorithm and Q learning.

One natural guess is that it is AlphaGo-style Monte Carlo Tree Search of the token trajectory. 🔎 It seems like a natural next step: Previously, papers like AlphaCode showed that even very naive brute force sampling in an LLM can get you huge improvements in competitive programming. The next logical step is to search the token tree in a more principled way. This particularly makes sense in settings like coding and math where there is an easy way to determine correctness. -> Indeed, Q* seems to be about solving Math problems 🧮""

""Anyone want to speculate on OpenAI’s secret Q* project? 

- Something similar to tree-of-thought with intermediate evaluation (like A*)? 

- Monte-Carlo Tree Search like forward roll-outs with LLM decoder and q-learning (like AlphaGo)?

- Maybe they meant Q-Bert, which combines LLMs and deep Q-learning

Before we get too excited, the academic community has been circling around these ideas for a while. There are a ton of papers in the last 6 months that could be said to combine some sort of tree-of-thought and graph search. Also some work on state-space RL and LLMs.""

https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/22/23973354/a-recent-openai-breakthrough-on-the-path-to-agi-has-caused-a-stir 

OpenAI spokesperson Lindsey Held Bolton refuted it:

""refuted that notion in a statement shared with The Verge: “Mira told employees what the media reports were about but she did not comment on the accuracy of the information.”""

https://www.wired.com/story/google-deepmind-demis-hassabis-chatgpt/ 

Google DeepMind's Gemini, that is currently the biggest rival with GPT4, which was delayed to the start of 2024, is also trying similar things: AlphaZero-based MCTS through chains of thought, according to Hassabis.

Demis Hassabis: ""At a high level you can think of Gemini as combining some of the strengths of AlphaGo-type systems with the amazing language capabilities of the large models. We also have some new innovations that are going to be pretty interesting.""

https://twitter.com/abacaj/status/1727494917356703829

Aligns with DeepMind Chief AGI scientist Shane Legg saying: ""To do really creative problem solving you need to start searching.""

https://twitter.com/iamgingertrash/status/1727482695356494132

""With Q*, OpenAI have likely solved planning/agentic behavior for small models. Scale this up to a very large model and you can start planning for increasingly abstract goals. It is a fundamental breakthrough that is the crux of agentic behavior. To solve problems effectively next token prediction is not enough. You need an internal monologue of sorts where you traverse a tree of possibilities using less compute before using compute to actually venture down a branch. Planning in this case refers to generating the tree and predicting the quickest path to solution""

My thoughts:

If this is true, and really a breakthrough, that might have caused the whole chaos: For true superintelligence you need flexibility and systematicity. Combining the machinery of general and narrow intelligence (I like the DeepMind's taxonomy of AGI https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.02462.pdf ) might be the path to both general and narrow superintelligence."
181xyx4,6,2023-11-23,I don't know if these will help anyone but they were a blessing for me.,u/ThePromptfather,ESL_Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/ESL_Teachers/comments/181xyx4/i_dont_know_if_these_will_help_anyone_but_they/,"Hi, I've been teaching in Asia for some time and when ChatGPT came out I decided to make some tools to make my life easier. I made a level checker, a speech analyser and a dialogue practice game. 

As you know different countries have different hang ups/linguistic challenges, so rather than make a one size fits all, I made them so that they were fine tuned to the cultural/language/societal difficulties each country faced, using notes I'd taken over the years. 

It didn't take a great deal of effort to make them tbh as I tinkered over a few months. There's lots of these things available now but not that focus on individual countries.

So far I've done China, Japan, Thailand, Russia, India (Hindi), Mexico.

They're completely free to use, although you do need a ChatGPT subscription, I'll make it available for the free version of GPT as soon as I figure out how. 

I made them so it will speak to them in their native language (you can override that by just asking for English) so that it's just focusing on them speaking, and I really pumped up the translation process and all my students were impressed at how natural it sounds.

It will ask them to talk about whatever they want, it asks about English goals etc to start and they press the record or headphones button to speak. It transcribes and analyses (it can't 'listen' like we do unfortunately just yet, so pronunciation it can't pick up on so well) for;

- grammar

- vocabulary 

- fluency

- cohesion/coherence 

It will only tell them the major errors unless the student asks for in-depth feedback and an error to word ratio score as a percentage. 

It focuses on effective communication over grammatic perfection and utilizes progress tracking so it will follow up and also will steer them to working on issues they're having.

It's a practise tool for them to use without pressure, they can use it before a meeting with a teacher/bank manager/hairdresser whoever, or just to go over things they need work on. 

Anyway, I thought I'd share them as I've had a lot from the community over the years on my main account, and wanted to give something back!

Here is the page with them on it:

If you have any feedback I would love to hear from you!

182zhb4,65,2023-11-24,What is your school doing to address AI?,u/actual-catlady,CanadianTeachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadianTeachers/comments/182zhb4/what_is_your_school_doing_to_address_ai/,"We used to have secure software that would lock a student's browser when typing an essay assignment (which wasn't perfect, but worked well enough overall), then the provincial government decided that wasn't necessary anymore, lol. So we've just been fuckin winging it. Students are turning in AI shit left and right, and even if we use multiple AI checkers, look at the doc edit history, and show students examples of how chatGPT spits out basically the same thing they turned in when I put the prompt in myself, they deny, deny, deny, and sometimes the parents get involved... ""how DARE you ACCUSE my child of using AI""... it's a fucking shit show and no one is doing anything about it, despite teachers BEGGING for solutions. 

Just curious to know if any other schools have found any success in mitigating AI. I am desperate lol.

And personally, it makes my blood fucking boil to waste my time marking a paragraph or a paper that wasn't written by a human. It feels so demeaning and like it's an insult to my intelligence and my education, which is part of why I'm so fucking angry about the whole situation and the lack of support we're receiving."

183ok48,2,2023-11-25,How to Best Use AI as an Educational Tool – 10 Genius Tricks You Didn’t Know Existed,u/Science-man777,learnmachinelearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/183ok48/how_to_best_use_ai_as_an_educational_tool_10/,""" Up until now, much of the discussion surrounding the use of generative AI in education has centered on catching AI used in cheating.  Some educators have seen generative AI as an awkward reality that makes writing assignments difficult to regulate.  With ChatGPT 4.0, students can pass off AI writing as their own original work thus circumventing the point of the assignment.  AI is seen as the ultimate slacker tool, making it irresistibly easy for lazy students to complete writing assignments at the press of a button.  

Educators Strike Back?

How are teachers supposed to respond to this?  I think there are two possible responses to this.  One is the first, very understandable response, which is to attempt to catch the “AI cheater” in the act.  This reaction makes sense at the moment since educational organizations have not yet had time to understand and respond to the technology.  To help on that front, we have created a thorough review of how educators might catch the students who decide to become AI cheaters in the article at this link.

If You Can’t Beat’em…

However, in this article, we will look at what I believe is the second possible response educators can have to this technology: rather than trying to constantly stay ahead of this ever-evolving technology in order to try and “catch the cheater,” can we rather ask if there is a way of using generative AI as an educational asset?  Could we possibly view [machine learning](https://ai-solutions.pro/what-is-machine-learning-a-beginners-guide/) and [Natural Language Processing](https://ai-solutions.pro/what-is-natural-language-processing-nlp-the-ultimate-beginners-guide/) as a natural next step in the advancement of technology, much like math teachers eventually accepted the use of calculators in math class?

184663b,1,2023-11-26,Does studying economics make you more selfish?,u/Significant-Notice-,marginal,https://www.reddit.com/r/marginal/comments/184663b/does_studying_economics_make_you_more_selfish/,"Maybe not:

It is widely held that studying economics makes you more selfish and politically conservative. We use a difference-in-differences strategy to disentangle the causal impact of economics education from selection effects. We estimate the effect of four different intermediate microeconomics courses on students’ experimentally elicited social preferences and beliefs about others, and policy opinions. We find no discernible effect of studying economics (whatever the course content) on self-interest or beliefs about others’ self-interest. Results on policy preferences also point to little effect, except that economics may make students somewhat less opposed to highly restrictive immigration policies.

That is from [a newly published paper](https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/soej.12672) by Daniele Girardi, Sai Madhurika Mamunuru, Simon D. Halliday, and Samuel Bowles.  This is a good example of a myth that got started with relatively little basis in fact.  At the very least it now has to be filed under “unconfirmed, likely false.”  Via [Stefan Schubert](https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://twitter.com/StefanFSchubert).

184m2c3,42,2023-11-26,A Guide to Supplementing Your Income in the UK,u/IvyRoney,UniUK,https://www.reddit.com/r/UniUK/comments/184m2c3/a_guide_to_supplementing_your_income_in_the_uk/,"I've frequented this sub for some time and something that inevitably comes up time and again is the financial struggle of being a student. So basically what I've done is expanded on all the ways one can earn extra money in the UK, and also separated them by category. This list is based on my own experience of using various online sites and methods to supplement my own income over the past years, and I'm hoping that it will be relevant and helpful to many people in this community.

As always, the best advice for someone who needs more income is probably to get a job or to work towards a promotion, however, these things can also take quite a long time to achieve.

This list is for people who are looking for ways to supplement their income right now, and who would benefit from having a little extra each month to tide them over until their situation improves.

Anyway, Here is the list:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# Testing:

**(1) Usertesting:**

With this site, you test out the usability of apps and websites and get paid for it. Many of the tests only take 10 minutes and pay around £8.50 per, which is really good. Of course, you won't qualify for every test you apply to, but even if you apply to 10 and only qualify for 1, you're still going to be earning around £8.50 for that half hour of your time, as it only takes a minute or two to apply for each test. There are also longer tests you can apply for, which pay much more.

Your work consists of interacting with 'prototype' or ‘in production’ websites or mobile apps while speaking out loud to share your thoughts, emotions, criticisms, and suggestions. For the longer tests, you will sometimes have to video call with someone while you are completing the user test, which may sound a little offputting at first, but you'll find that this actually makes the hour go much faster than if you were doing an hour of shorter tests.

**(2) Userlytics:**

Like with Usertesting, you are getting paid for your feedback as you test out the usability of apps and websites. Again, you will have to have your microphone (and sometimes video) enabled while you share your impressions of the video, website, prototype, app, etc. that you are testing.

This site also pays quite well for the time you need to put in per test. Typically, the shorter tests pay around £4-£8, while longer tests can pay up to around £70, though qualifying for these is not a common occurrence in my experience.

It's important to note, that with this site and all testing sites, different people will qualify for different tests based on the answers they give in the screeners, which determine if you are a suitable candidate for the test you're applying for. With this in mind, my advice is to stay determined and keep applying, because you never really know when you'll be the perfect candidate for a test, and sometimes the test you're a perfect fit for will be one of the highest paying.

**(3) Intellizoom:**

This site is very similar to the others in that you are being paid for your feedback.It contains ""Think out Loud"" studies which require you to talk as you complete various tasks. Like with the other testing sites, what you earn will depend on what studies you're a match for. This site doesn't have quite as high an earning potential as other testing sites, with studies that require you to record video and audio usually paying around £8.50, and standard studies paying around £1.50.

**(4) Testingtime:**

Again, with Testingtime, you're being compensated for testing apps, websites and other products.  Your value as a tester comes from the fact that you're helping to influence the development of future products and services.

**(5) Utest:**

This isn't a site I see mentioned too often. It's essentially the same as the others in that you'll be matched with testing projects based on the information you've entered on your profile. The majority of projects involve functional testing, where testers use an app or website and look out for bugs and issues.

# 

# Projects & Tasks:

**(1) Teemwork:**

A crowd-sourcing site where you can complete various jobs and tasks. There is a great variety of jobs available, with tasks such as translation, evaluation, and video/audio collection showing up frequently. It would take a long time to list the all various tasks that appear on this site, as there really is a varied amount of work available on a daily basis.

This site pays very well for the time you put in, with many tasks paying £25-£30 for less than an hour of your time. When you first sign up, you may not see a huge amount of jobs available, but I would recommend checking back as often as you can, as some days there is a lot more available work than others. This site also pays out to Paypal.

**(2) Appen:**

This is a site where you can apply to work on various projects online, including social media evaluation, translation, data collection, surveys, paid conversation and many more. The rate of pay is very competitive, with some jobs paying up to £20 per hour. Most jobs pay around £11-£15 per hour (which is still great for online work) and I have not found it difficult to qualify for projects.

The potential earnings from this site over the course of a year can easily enter the £100s or even £1000s, so if it's not on your radar it really should be.

Apply for as many projects/tasks as you can, it's well worth taking the time to apply because even if you get one project, that can be hours of work at a great hourly rate.

**(3) Clickworker:**

Like others listed, Clickworker is a 'task for pay' site. Very similar to Neevo in that the tasks you perform are used to help train AI.

There's a decent variety of tasks available, my favourite being voice recordings of various sentences and phrases. There are also many tasks that revolve around taking photos of random things. The payment is fast and reliable and uses Paypal, never had any problems with these guys.

My advice is to get onto the UHRS section of the site to earn more money, there's a banner at the top of your jobs section which you can click to qualify for UHRS. You'll need to do a sort of exam to qualify, but it's mostly just a test of your English comprehension skills as far as I remember.

**(4) Neevo:**

Companies submit projects to Neevo to help improve their AI systems. When you’re a match for a project, you’ll be asked to complete a set of simple tasks, which could be in the form of text, audio, images or even video.

It's a straightforward 'task for pay' site. They payout through Paypal and the variety of jobs is good. I check this site every now and then, I know it's a smaller earner so I don't like to give it too much of my time. My advice would be to keep your eyes peeled for higher paying jobs that come along, Some of the lower paying tasks aren't really worth it for the time you need to put in.

# 

# Studies & Research:

**(1) Prolific:**

This is definitely one of the top paid study sites around. With Prolific you get paid cash for engaging in the research of Academics and Universities from around the world. There are Surveys and studies about scientific research, new products and public opinion. From minutes to hours, to multipart studies over longer periods, there's a respectable range of studies to participate in.

This site pays out to Paypal, it has a range of interesting surveys, and studies pay a minimum of £6.50 per hour. Each study or survey tells you the amount you'll be paid for completing the task and also gives you the hourly rate of said task, which is very useful.

If you compare Prolific to other Study/Research sites, like Respondent or User interviews, for example, you might at first notice that the pay per task is much lower. However, what sets Prolific apart from sites with higher paying studies is the frequency with which you'll receive tasks. I often leave the Prolific tab open while I'm working on something else, and it's not unusual to receive 5-6 short studies over a 2-3 hour time period. The advantage here is that you'll receive tasks based on the information you've entered on your profile, whereas on other paid research sites, you would be applying for higher paying tasks with screeners, but it may not be often that you get accepted for the studies you apply for.

**(2) Respondent:**

I'm sure some of you have heard about Respondent, It's a site where you get paid for taking part in various studies. The studies can be both remote and in-person but these days most of the available studies are remote.

It doesn't take long to apply to studies so even if you don't qualify, you haven't wasted too much time. Also, the pay is excellent when you do qualify, with studies generally paying between £10-£150, depending on the type of study and the amount of time it takes (Generally ranges from 15-90 minutes).

It's not really a site that you can depend on for frequent payouts, but even if you land a few studies that pay £60 or £70 each, you're doing very well for the time you put in, so I do think this one is worth checking every day if you have 5 minutes to spare.

**(3) User Interviews:**

User Interviews is a site where you get paid to take part in various studies. There are normally a lot of studies available to apply for and the screeners are usually short and sweet.

This one has a high earning potential, due to the vast variety of study topics offered on the site. If you check your homepage frequently enough, it won't be long before you find a study that is looking for an applicant with your background/interests. Studies can pay anywhere from around £8-£200.

**(4) Grapevine Panel:**

A market research site where you get paid for your input as you participate in group discussions and one-to-one interviews. You'll be notified by email when projects become available and it pays quite well for the time you put in.

**(5) Dscout:**

So with this site you are rewarded for helping with Market Research. The way this works is that you are given ""missions"" where you offer your opinions/feedback on various products or services in exchange for payment.

The Pay is good and the payout is received promptly through PayPal. I also like that you answer photo and video questions, it keeps me a bit more engaged.

Although the pay per task is reasonable, I wouldn't say that the frequency of available tasks is its strong point. Check as often as you can for available missions and apply for all of them. It may take a little bit of time to get your first mission but once you do, more and more will appear.

**(6) Angelfish Opinions:**

Another market research site where you get paid to take part in focus groups and surveys. Pays £1-£100 per task.

**(7) People for Research:**

Get paid to take part in market research. This site pays very well, with many projects offering £40-£80 per hour.

**(8) Focus Force:**

A research group that pays for your opinions and various products and services.

**(9) Focus 4 People:**

Get paid up to £150 for your participation in various research projects.

# 

# Surveys:

**(1) Qmee:**

A site/app where you get paid to help influence products and services by completing surveys.One of the stand-out advantages of Qmee is that you can cash out whenever you like, from as little as 1p, and it also pays out to Paypal.

There is usually a decent amount of surveys available, and for a paid survey site, the pay is relatively good.

**(2) Attapoll:**

An app where you get paid for answering surveys.

The surveys have a star rating so you can see which ones are most popular amongst users. The payout is fast and I find myself using this app more and more when I'm doing idle things like taking the train or on lunch break.

You can cash out to Paypal once you have earned £3. As with the majority of paid surveys, you're certainly not going to earn a fortune, but if work is scarce on some of the higher earning sites, then it's always good to have these types of tasks as a safety.

**(3) Lifepoints:**

Another reliable Survey site, You share your opinions on numerous products and brands and get paid for it.

There's a nice variety of surveys available every month and at certain points throughout the year larger surveys appear which pay quite well, it's just a matter of checking your jobs page often enough to catch these. Also Pays out through Paypal.

My advice would be to be patient. Some days it may seem that there are very few surveys available, but check back the next day and there could be much more after appearing.

&#x200B;

# Matched Betting:

This one is quite a unique means to make extra money in a short period of time, It's called Matched Betting. It's a very simple process but it's imperative that you read the Guides in full before you begin.

Matched Betting is where you use bookmaker sites to complete various 'Free Bet' offers (e.g Bet £10, Get £30 in Free bets), but the whole idea behind the process is that every time you ""make a bet"", you match that same bet on the exchange (meaning the value of your qualifying bet will always be returned to you).

So for example, if I bet £10 for Real Madrid **to Win** on the Bookmaker Site at odds of 2.5, I then also make a Matched bet on the Exchange (This is a separate site such as Smarkets or Betfair) where I bet for Real Madrid **not to win** at odds of 2.5 (or as close as I can get to those odds). In this way, I am covered in all outcomes (win, lose or draw), and it allows me to fulfil the requirements of the bookmaker's offer (e.g Bet £10 and get £30 in Free bets). The money from my initial bet has now been returned to me and I also have a £30 free bet credited to my account.

When I receive my £30 free bet, It's the same process of matching again but this time using my free bet on the bookmaker site. This is where I secure a profit, because I'm not using 'real money', and even if I lose on the bookmaker site, I will be paid out on the exchange.

This one is great if you can spare some money to get started. Your money isn't 'invested' or 'tied up' in anything, It's just that you'll need cash in order to complete the various free bet offers. You can withdraw your money at any time, but most people leave £100-£200 in their accounts just because it's easier than depositing money every time you want to do an offer. Over the course of 30 days, that £100-£200 or so will grow to £600-£700.

The main advantage of Matched Betting is that it really doesn't take a lot of time to hit that £500 profit mark. Over a 4 week period, I worked my way down through the list of welcome offers, nice and handy, and having completed 20 offers at 15 minutes per offer, I came out at £470 for 5 hours total of work.

Not to knock paid projects/survey sites, but if you don't have the time or desire to invest in that kind of online work, the obvious advantage with Matched betting is speed and simplicity.

NOTE: If you have a history with gambling, do not come near Matched Betting. Matched Betting is not gambling, but the fact you will be using betting websites to facilitate a profit is too much of a temptation- It's not worth it.

# 

# Transcription:

**(1) Rev:**

With Rev, you'll be paid to transcribe speech in audio and video files. If you're unfamiliar with this type of work, all it is is converting speech into text, like creating subtitles for a video, for example.

As a Transcriptionist, you can earn around 20-90p per audio/video minute. As a Captioner, you can earn around 40-90p per audio/video minute. If you also know a foreign language, then you can earn even more. This site pays out to Paypal weekly.

**(2) Way With Words:**

This is another popular transcription site. You'll earn around 35p-£1.50 per audio minute, depending on the project, and you'll be paid into your bank account monthly.

# 

# Content Moderation:

**(1) Modsquad:**

This is a site where you get paid to moderate content and help manage various online communities. The upside of this type of work is that it's flexible and you can choose projects that align with your own interests and knowledge.

The amount you earn depends on what kind of project you're working on and what skills you have. If it sounds like something you might be interested in, then all you need to get started is a computer, an internet connection, and a phone.

**(2) Crisp Thinking:**

With Crisp Thinking, the type of work you're applying for is something known as a 'Risk Analyst Contractor'. I know, it sounds like a very niche type of job, but in fact, it is content moderation just like Mod squad.

Essentially your role is to identify risks in online content. You can apply for this project by joining the waiting list on Crisp Thinking, found at the bottom of the 'careers' page, reading: 'If you wish to apply for freelance moderation work, find out more here'

I have read that this work pays very well, which is why there is usually a waiting list, but if it sounds like something you could see yourself doing in your spare time, then you might as well apply and hope for the best.

# 

# Freelancing:

**(1) Fiverr:**

Offer your services as a Freelancer and get paid. You can earn a lot from the ""gigs"" you post, but you'll need to have some kind of service you can offer that people will pay for. I'd recommend taking a look at what other people are posting and seeing if you could offer similar work.

You'll need to think of some kind of service that you can charge money for, but this can be just about anything. This also means that there's unlimited earning potential because you're creating your own work.

**(2)  Freelancer:**

Another great site where you can offer your services as a Freelancer. You can post projects offering whatever category of skill you possess, be it ghostwriting, programming, data entry, or blogging. If you have a service to offer, then you can get paid for it on this site.

Like with Fiverr, I would recommend taking a look at the home page of the site to see what kind of services other users are offering. This will likely give you some ideas of the type of projects you could post, because even if you don't think you have a skill you could charge money for, you probably do.

**(3) People Per Hour:**

I like this one because you can send proposals to complete a certain task. For example, you might see a post where someone wants a person to write social media posts or proofread a piece of work.

There's always a good variety of jobs available, and the more you build up your profile, the more work you'll get.

**(4) Guru:**

Another popular freelancing site. Essentially the same as Fiverr or Freelancer.

# 

# Selling/Renting:

**(1) Vinted:**

This is a great Site/App where you can sell your old clothes. Maybe it doesn’t sound like your thing or you don’t think you have anything fashionable enough to sell. Believe me, You can sell any item of clothing here.

I’ve sold clothes here in the past and have been pleasantly surprised with a nice few sales. The process of signing up and getting started selling is very easy, and the items of clothing you list will likely receive attention even if you aren’t a top seller.

**(2) Facebook Marketplace:**

Sell your old stuff. This one should honestly be mentioned in every thread where someone has asked how to make some extra cash in a hurry.

We all have stuff we don't use anymore lying around the house and as obvious as it may sound, the items that seem old and worthless to you will be new and exciting to someone else.I'm talking anything, literally anything: Old clothes, books, plant pots, gadgets you don't use anymore, furniture, homemade crafts etc.

Old Clothes seem to really sell fast, which isn't surprising because people get excited when they see something that's their style and really cheap. So clear out your wardrobe.

If you're into crafts, you could sell stuff you've made there too. The point is, You could easily make £50-£100 or more if you do a thorough sweep of your house for stuff you don't want/use anymore.

**(3) Fat Llama:**

This is a site where you can rent out pretty much anything. I first discovered it when I was trying to find a cheap place to rent some tools.

You can browse the site and see what kind of things other people are renting out, you'd be surprised by the number of items in your own home that you might not have use for but others would be happy to rent from you for the day.

# 

# Something Different:

**(1) Rover:**

This one is quite a great site where you can offer your services as a dog sitter/dog walker. You can have dogs dropped off at your home and get paid to look after them for a duration of time.It's ideal for people who miss having pets or who get a bit lonely working from home, etc. The pay is usually around £20 per day for dog sitting, maybe £6-£10 for dog walking. If you're at a loose end anyway or just feel like having a furry companion during your free time, This site is a nice way to earn a little money and make some canine friends.

You just make a profile and enter your address so people in your area can find you, Bonus points if you have a dog in your profile photo with you.

**(2) My Tutor:**

MyTutor is an online-tutoring site, I don’t see this site mentioned a whole lot but it really is a gem. This one is ideal for students and recent graduates, but if you have skills or knowledge in any teachable subject then you should check it out. You don’t need any previous experience as a tutor to work here.

You can earn up to £20 per hour and the work is rewarding and meaningful because you are helping others to learn. It’s also very “social” online work, which some people may see as a nice change.

Also, If you like the idea of tutoring but don't have knowledge in any of the teachable subjects listed on My Tutor, There is also the option of teaching ESL, which you can do a quick TEFL course on and may be worth the investment if you think you'd be interested in that type of work. It can be quite a good earner too. You can do these classes freelance or work for an online company such as Preply or Hallo.

&#x200B;

# Bank Switching:

Bank switching has become quite well known on the sub, but understandably a lot of people are hesitant to try it out because it seems like too much effort or because it may affect their credit score.

I have done a few bank switches in the past year, and was pleasantly surprised by how easy they were. It's essentially free money for what usually amounts to less than an hour of your time.

The only thing I would say is that if you're applying for a mortgage soon, it is probably best to give these a miss, as they may affect your credit score.

With that said, Bank switching is a great way to earn a decent amount of extra cash (Up to £850), and you can actually earn more from these switch offers if you sign up through cashback sites, so you should check if there is a cashback offer available on Topcashack, Quidco, etc. before completing each switch.

**Note:** Below are short summaries of the requirements for each bank switch, however, you should go to the wesbite of each bank mentioned below and read the full details of each switch before you complete it.

&#x200B;

**(1) Nationwide: £200**

Complete a full switch to a FlexPlus, FlexDirect or FlexAccount and switch two direct debits to receive £200 to your bank account. You can easily set up direct debits such as Paypal and OnePounddd to meet the requirements of this offer. You'll receive the £200 within 10 days of the switch completing.

**(2) Halifax: £250**

Complete a full switch to either the Rewards Current Account or Ultimate Rewards Current Account and receive £250. No direct debits required.

**(3) Co-op Bank: £125**

Switch to Co-op Bank through a refer a friend link, Set up 2 direct debits, Deposit £800, Make 5 card payments and register for online banking. Then complete an online form with your details ( name, switch date and account number) and you'll receive £125 to your account.

**(4) Barclays: £175**

Download the Barclays app and open a bank account. Once open, join Blue Rewards in app. Then, go to the Products section of the app and select account switch. You will need to switch an account with two active direct debits. You will receive £175 to your account within 2 weeks of starting the switch.

**(5) First Direct Switch: £175**

Switch an existing bank account to First Direct, Pay £1000 into the account within 3 months of switching, and Receive £175 to your account. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

That's all that I can think of right now for this list. I hope this post is of help to some people and if you have any questions about anything I mentioned just ask and I'll do my best to answer.

Thanks for reading."

* **This new tech can accelerate LLMs by 300x**   
\- Researchers at ETH Zurich have developed a new technique that can accelerate language models by 300 times. By introducing ""fast feedforward"" layers (FFF) that use conditional matrix multiplication (CMM) instead of dense matrix multiplications (DMM), the researchers were able to significantly reduce the computational load of neural networks.   
\- They validated their technique with FastBERT, a modified version of Google's BERT model, and achieved impressive results on various language tasks. The researchers believe that incorporating fast feedforward networks into LLMs like GPT-3 could lead to even greater acceleration.
* **AI tool 'Screenshot-to-Code' generates entire code**   
\- This simple app converts a screenshot to HTML/Tailwind CSS. It uses GPT-4 Vision to generate the code and DALL-E 3 to generate similar-looking images. Also, you can now enter a URL to clone a live website! 
* **Microsoft Research explains why Hallucination is necessary in LLMs!**  
\- Microsoft Research + 4 others have explored that there is a statistical reason behind these hallucinations, unrelated to the model architecture or data quality. For arbitrary facts that cannot be verified from the training data, hallucination is necessary for language models that satisfy a statistical calibration condition. However, the analysis suggests that pretraining does not lead to hallucinations on facts that appear more than once in the training data or on systematic facts. Different architectures and learning algorithms may help mitigate these types of hallucinations.
* And there was more…

Imagine this: it's 11:30pm, and you are frantically trying to finish an essay due at midnight. In a bid to save time, you turn to AI tools like ChatGPT for help. Once you have the AI-generated essay, you find yourself painstakingly paraphrasing each line, hoping to make it undetectable, to pass it off as your own work. This process, often fraught with stress and uncertainty, has become a common practice in a world where AI writing tools are just a click away. But here’s the catch – as AI detectors become more advanced, simple paraphrasing is no longer enough. This is where undetectable AI steps in, revolutionizing how we approach AI-assisted writing. In this post, we delve into the limitations of paraphrasing AI-generated content and explore how undetectable AI is reshaping the future of academic writing, offering a smarter, more secure way to harness the power of AI for your essays.

Students often turn to AI-generated content to assist with their academic writing, but to avoid detection, they engage in paraphrasing. This involves altering the structure and wording of AI-generated text while maintaining the original meaning. Techniques include changing sentence structures, using synonyms, and reordering content segments. However, this approach is usually taken to bypass plagiarism checkers and AI detectors, assuming that superficial changes can mask the AI's involvement. Here's a closer look at how students typically paraphrase AI-generated content: 

### 1. Word Substitution

**Using Synonyms**: Students frequently replace words in the AI-generated text with synonyms. This technique changes the superficial layer of the text while keeping the underlying ideas intact.

**Altering Technical Terms**: For subject-specific content, students might substitute technical terms or jargon with more common language or vice versa. 

### 2. Sentence Structure Modification

**Reordering Sentences**: Changing the order of sentences within a paragraph to make the flow of ideas seem different.

**Combining or Splitting Sentences**: Students often combine short sentences into longer, more complex ones or break down long sentences into shorter ones. This alters the rhythm and structure of the text. 

### 3. Content Rearrangement

**Reorganizing Paragraphs**: Moving paragraphs or parts of the content around to create a different progression of ideas or arguments.

**Adding or Removing Sections**: Students might add their own insights or remove sections from the AI-generated content to give the impression of a different focus or analysis. 

### 4. Introduction and Conclusion Rewrite

**Personalizing the Opening and Closing**: Rewriting the introduction and conclusion is common, as these parts are crucial in reflecting a student's personal voice and perspective. 

### 5. Incorporating Personal Insights and Examples

**Adding Personal Anecdotes or Examples**: Students may insert their own experiences, examples, or insights, which can significantly change the nature of the content and make it appear more personalized. 

### Limitations and Challenges

While paraphrasing can modify the AI-generated text, it poses several challenges:

**Time-Consuming**: The process can be time-consuming and might not save as much effort as initially intended.

**Risk of Losing Original Meaning**: Excessive paraphrasing can lead to a loss of the original content’s meaning or coherence.

**Potential Ethical Issues**: There are ethical considerations, especially in academic settings, where passing off AI-generated content as one's own, even when paraphrased, can be considered dishonest. 

## Why Paraphrasing Won't Work Against AI Detectors

Advancements in AI detection tools have rendered simple paraphrasing ineffective. These detectors analyze writing patterns, including sentence structure, word choice, and even the subtleties of style that are unique to AI-generated content. Simply rewording or reordering sentences from AI-generated content is often insufficient to evade such advanced detection. As these tools become more sophisticated, they can identify underlying patterns indicative of AI, regardless of superficial changes made to the text. 

## What is Undetectable AI?

Undetectable AI refers to advanced artificial intelligence systems that generate content virtually indistinguishable from human-written text. These systems, like StealthGPT, use sophisticated algorithms and natural language processing techniques to mimic human writing styles accurately. The key feature of undetectable AI is its ability to produce content that can bypass even the most advanced AI detection tools, making it a revolutionary tool in fields that require original and authentic content. 

## How Undetectable AI Prevents AI Detection

Undetectable AI, such as StealthGPT, is designed to generate content that evades detection by AI detectors, which are tools used to identify AI-generated text. This capability is crucial, particularly in contexts where the authenticity of human authorship is important. Here’s how undetectable AI manages to prevent AI detection: 

### 1. Advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP):

**Human-Like Language Modeling**: Undetectable AI utilizes sophisticated NLP models trained on vast and diverse datasets. This training enables the AI to produce text that closely mimics human writing styles, including the nuances, variances, and complexities of natural language.

**Contextual Awareness and Adaptation**: The AI can contextually adapt its writing, ensuring that the content is not just grammatically correct but also contextually appropriate and stylistically varied, much like human-written text. 

### 2. Avoidance of Predictable Patterns:

**Randomization and Variation**: To evade detection, undetectable AI avoids repetitive linguistic patterns and predictable sentence structures, which are common markers used by AI detectors. It uses randomization techniques to vary word choice, sentence length, and syntax.

**Emulating Human Idiosyncrasies**: The AI includes idiosyncrasies typical of human writing, such as colloquialisms, idiomatic expressions, and even controlled imperfections, to replicate the organic feel of human writing. 

### 3. Continuous Learning and Updating:

**Adapting to Detection Algorithms**: Undetectable AI systems are continually updated to stay ahead of the latest AI detection algorithms. They are trained to recognize and adapt to new patterns that detectors use to identify AI-written content.

**Incorporating User Feedback**: User feedback and interactions help the AI to learn and evolve, further refining its ability to produce undetectable content. 

### 4. Sophisticated Content Structuring:

**Logical and Coherent Flow**: The AI ensures that the content is logically structured and coherent, mirroring the way humans organize and present information, which is a challenging aspect for many AI detectors to analyze.

**Customization and Personalization**:

**Tailoring Content to Specific Needs**: The ability to customize content based on specific user inputs (like writing style, tone, or specific points to cover) makes it harder for detectors to identify a consistent AI fingerprint across different pieces of text generated by the AI. 

### Practical Example

For instance, when a university student uses StealthGPT to write an essay on a historical topic, the AI not only provides well-researched content but also presents it with varied sentence structures, personalized style adjustments, and a logical flow of arguments, making the essay indistinguishable from one written by a human. 

## Conclusion

The era of simply paraphrasing AI-generated content to bypass detection is becoming obsolete with the rise of advanced AI detectors. The future lies in undetectable AI, which offers a sophisticated solution to the challenges of authentic content creation. As we embrace undetectable AI, the focus shifts from evading detection to enhancing creativity and efficiency, ensuring the integrity and originality of AI-assisted writing in various academic and professional contexts.

In today's episode, we'll cover rumors surrounding a groundbreaking AI called Q\*, OpenAI's leaked AI breakthrough called Q\* and DeepMind's similar project, the potential of AI replacing human jobs in tasks like wire sending, and a recommended book called ""AI Unraveled"" that answers frequently asked questions about artificial intelligence.

Rumors have been circulating about a groundbreaking AI known as Q\* (pronounced Q-Star), which is closely tied to a series of chaotic events that disrupted OpenAI following the sudden dismissal of their CEO, Sam Altman. In this discussion, we will explore the implications of Altman's firing, speculate on potential reasons behind it, and consider Microsoft's pursuit of a monopoly on highly efficient AI technologies.

To comprehend the significance of Q\*, it is essential to delve into the theory of combining Q-learning and A\* algorithms. Q\* is an AI that excels in grade-school mathematics without relying on external aids like Wolfram. This achievement is revolutionary and challenges common perceptions of AI as mere information repeaters and stochastic parrots. Q\* showcases iterative learning, intricate logic, and highly effective long-term strategizing, potentially paving the way for advancements in scientific research and breaking down previously insurmountable barriers.

Let's first understand A\* algorithms and Q-learning to grasp the context in which Q\* operates. A\* algorithms are powerful tools used to find the shortest path between two points in a graph or map while efficiently navigating obstacles. These algorithms excel at optimizing route planning when efficiency is crucial. In the case of chatbot AI, A\* algorithms are used to traverse complex information landscapes and locate the most relevant responses or solutions for user queries.

On the other hand, Q-learning involves providing the AI with a constantly expanding cheat sheet to help it make the best decisions based on past experiences. However, in complex scenarios with numerous states and actions, maintaining a large cheat sheet becomes impractical. Deep Q-learning addresses this challenge by utilizing neural networks to approximate the Q-value function, making it more efficient. Instead of a colossal Q-table, the network maps input states to action-Q-value pairs, providing a compact cheat sheet to navigate complex scenarios efficiently. This approach allows AI agents to choose actions using the Epsilon-Greedy approach, sometimes exploring randomly and sometimes relying on the best-known actions predicted by the networks. DQNs (Deep Q-networks) typically use two neural networks—the main and target networks—which periodically synchronize their weights, enhancing learning and stabilizing the overall process. This synchronization is crucial for achieving self-improvement, which is a remarkable feat. Additionally, the Bellman equation plays a role in updating weights using Experience replay, a sampling and training technique based on past actions, which allows the AI to learn in small batches without requiring training after every step.

Q\* represents more than a math prodigy; it signifies the potential to scale abstract goal navigation, enabling highly efficient, realistic, and logical planning for any query or goal. However, with such capabilities come challenges.

One challenge is web crawling and navigating complex websites. Just as a robot solving a maze may encounter convoluted pathways and dead ends, the web is labyrinthine and filled with myriad paths. While A\* algorithms aid in seeking the shortest path, intricate websites or information silos can confuse the AI, leading it astray. Furthermore, the speed of algorithm updates may lag behind the expansion of the web, potentially hindering the AI's ability to adapt promptly to changes in website structures or emerging information.

Another challenge arises in the application of Q-learning to high-dimensional data. The web contains various data types, from text to multimedia and interactive elements. Deep Q-learning struggles with high-dimensional data, where the number of features exceeds the number of observations. In such cases, if the AI encounters sites with complex structures or extensive multimedia content, efficiently processing such information becomes a significant challenge.

To address these issues, a delicate balance must be struck between optimizing pathfinding efficiency and adapting swiftly to the dynamic nature of the web. This balance ensures that users receive the most relevant and efficient solutions to their queries.

In conclusion, speculations surrounding Q\* and the Gemini models suggest that enabling AI to plan is a highly rewarding but risky endeavor. As we continue researching and developing these technologies, it is crucial to prioritize AI safety protocols and put guardrails in place. This precautionary approach prevents the potential for AI to turn against us. Are we on the brink of an AI paradigm shift, or are these rumors mere distractions? Share your thoughts and join in this evolving AI saga—a front-row seat to the future!

Please note that the information presented here is based on speculation sourced from various news articles, research, and rumors surrounding Q\*. Hence, it is advisable to approach this discussion with caution and consider it in light of further developments in the field.

How the Rumors about Q\* Started

There have been recent rumors surrounding a supposed AI breakthrough called Q\*, which allegedly involves a combination of Q-learning and A\*. These rumors were initially sparked when OpenAI, the renowned artificial intelligence research organization, accidentally leaked information about this groundbreaking development, specifically mentioning Q\*'s impressive ability to ace grade-school math. However, it is crucial to note that these rumors were subsequently refuted by OpenAI.

It is worth mentioning that DeepMind, another prominent player in the AI field, is also working on a similar project called Gemini. Gemina is based on AlphaGo-style Monte Carlo Tree Search and aims to scale up the capabilities of these algorithms. The scalability of such systems is crucial in planning for increasingly abstract goals and achieving agentic behavior. These concepts have been extensively discussed and explored within the academic community for some time.

The origin of the rumors can be traced back to a letter sent by several staff researchers at OpenAI to the organization's board of directors. The letter served as a warning highlighting the potential threat to humanity posed by a powerful AI discovery. This letter specifically referenced the supposed breakthrough known as Q\* (pronounced Q-Star) and its implications.

Mira Murati, a representative of OpenAI, confirmed that the letter regarding the AI breakthrough was directly responsible for the subsequent actions taken by the board. The new model, when provided with vast computing resources, demonstrated the ability to solve certain mathematical problems. Although it performed at the level of grade-school students in mathematics, the researchers' optimism about Q\*'s future success grew due to its proficiency in such tests.

A notable theory regarding the nature of OpenAI's alleged breakthrough is that Q\* may be related to Q-learning. One possibility is that Q\* represents the optimal solution of the Bellman equation. Another hypothesis suggests that Q\* could be a combination of the A\* algorithm and Q-learning. Additionally, some speculate that Q\* might involve AlphaGo-style Monte Carlo Tree Search of the token trajectory. This idea builds upon previous research, such as AlphaCode, which demonstrated significant improvements in competitive programming through brute-force sampling in an LLM (Language and Learning Model). These speculations lead many to believe that Q\* might be focused on solving math problems effectively.

Considering DeepMind's involvement, experts also draw parallels between their Gemini project and OpenAI's Q\*. Gemini aims to combine the strengths of AlphaGo-type systems, particularly in terms of language capabilities, with new innovations that are expected to be quite intriguing. Demis Hassabis, a prominent figure at DeepMind, stated that Gemini would utilize AlphaZero-based MCTS (Monte Carlo Tree Search) through chains of thought. This aligns with DeepMind Chief AGI scientist Shane Legg's perspective that starting a search is crucial for creative problem-solving.

It is important to note that amidst the excitement and speculation surrounding OpenAI's alleged breakthrough, the academic community has already extensively explored similar ideas. In the past six months alone, numerous papers have discussed the combination of tree-of-thought, graph search, state-space reinforcement learning, and LLMs (Language and Learning Models). This context reminds us that while Q\* might be a significant development, it is not entirely unprecedented.

OpenAI's spokesperson, Lindsey Held Bolton, has officially rebuked the rumors surrounding Q\*. In a statement provided to The Verge, Bolton clarified that Mira Murati only informed employees about the media reports regarding the situation and did not comment on the accuracy of the information.

In conclusion, rumors regarding OpenAI's Q\* project have generated significant interest and speculation. The alleged breakthrough combines concepts from Q-learning and A\*, potentially leading to advancements in solving math problems. Furthermore, DeepMind's Gemini project shares similarities with Q\*, aiming to integrate the strengths of AlphaGo-type systems with language capabilities. While the academic community has explored similar ideas extensively, the potential impact of Q\* and Gemini on planning for abstract goals and achieving agentic behavior remains an exciting prospect within the field of artificial intelligence.

In simple terms, long-range planning and multi-modal models together create an economic agent. Allow me to paint a scenario for you: Picture yourself working at a bank. A notification appears, asking what you are currently doing. You reply, ""sending a wire for a customer."" An AI system observes your actions, noting a path and policy for mimicking the process.

The next time you mention ""sending a wire for a customer,"" the AI system initiates the learned process. However, it may make a few errors, requiring your guidance to correct them. The AI system then repeats this learning process with all 500 individuals in your job role.

Within a week, it becomes capable of recognizing incoming emails, extracting relevant information, navigating to the wire sending window, completing the required information, and ultimately sending the wire.

This approach combines long-term planning, a reward system, and reinforcement learning policies, akin to Q\* A\* methods. If planning and reinforcing actions through a multi-modal AI prove successful, it is possible that jobs traditionally carried out by humans using keyboards could become obsolete within the span of 1 to 3 years.

185obdf,1,2023-11-28,Am I being too picky/sensitive?,u/PeachyPesco,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/185obdf/am_i_being_too_pickysensitive/,"Relatively new teacher here. I've worked two long-term sub jobs in the past, one 6th grade gen ed and one resource room middle school math position. In both cases, the teachers quit mid-year because the behavior of the kids was so horrible. Yet through both of those jobs, I had a deep love of teaching and my students. Part of it was the confidence that I was doing my job well because my admin would occasionally thank me for me work, part of it is the constant compliments from the younger kids (even if the behavior was a lot worse), part of it is having curriculum I could base lessons off of, and part of it is the joy of loving and trying so hard for students who just weren't appreciated by their previous teachers.

I'm in my first permanent position now as a high school teacher and I feel so hopeless everyday.

My current situation is:

* I have 5 prep periods. I have no curriculum or materials left from previous teachers. 
* There are such a wide range of student abilities that it feels impossible to differentiate and it feels like I'm letting everyone down — around 1/3 of my students are new to the US and can't understand basic English, 1/3 seem to have learned helplessness and just lay on TikTok or sleep all period, and the last 1/3 finish early then seem disappointed that there's not more to do in the lesson. 
* There is no system for discipline, other teachers are confused when I ask about it. The only option seems to be calling down to the office in an emergency, there's nothing in place for smaller things like cell phone usage or work refusal. I don't want kids to be punished, I just want there to be SOME type of consequence or discussion from admin. But because there is no disciplinary system, students constantly ditch class, and I have students hanging out from other periods in my room with no accountability. There are students in my class with 30-40+ absences with no office follow-up.
* I have no copies of IEPs or 504 Plans. I keep asking for them but the SpEd department either says ""you should have them already"" (I don't) or ""don't worry about it"" (I am).
* There is an expectation that students should be able to make up work from ANY point in the semester, so it feels like I am constantly teaching 10 different lessons at once. (and I thought I was lenient with allowing things to be turned in up to a month late with no penalty...) 
* My manager sends me emails and requests for things written, I am not kidding, entirely by ChatGPT. 

When I try to talk to others at school about the problems I'm experiencing, I just get responses like ""Welcome to \[School Name\]!"" or ""This is a lot better than it used to be."" It's hard for me to remember why I wanted to do this career. I'm so new, is this normal? Was I just treated like a princess in my last couple jobs because I took a sub position nobody else wanted??"

I'm not sure if this is the right sub to ask this question, so please tell me if there's a better sub to ask this question.

I'm a student and me and my team have the assignment to make a chatbot for our university. We need to make a chatbot that can help other students find information about their course. We will get our data from manuals of multiple universtity websites (as pdf). This data will be turned into Q&A data using ChatGPT 4. 

However, we are struggling to find a pre-trained LLM that fits our assignment. We've researched T5, BERT and GPT-2 but our teacher was surprised those were the models we researched, since there are more popular and newer models. Our chatbot must be in Dutch, but we can translate so the LLM doesn't need to be trained on Dutch data. The LLM can't be too big, because we don't have the hardware for very large models.

We are currently looking at openchat and falcon, both with 7B parameters. Are these good options or does anyone have any tips for better LLMs?"

18645ye,2,2023-11-28,How to write an online exam that is harder to cheat on than write,u/talondarkx,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/18645ye/how_to_write_an_online_exam_that_is_harder_to/,"Hi everyone, 

I am planning an online exam for my online course. The course is on management and secondary research methods, and in the past the exam had multiple choice questions and asked students to read a few articles and summarize the different parts of the journal articles. It is a first year class, so we're just trying to establish fundamentals. ChatGPT is, unfortunately, excellent at all of this. My students are almost all international students whose primary way of interacting with education is 'try to cheat first, do it honestly second'. 

(Many of you will think, ""why are there even online courses available then to this student population? This is an excellent question! But the answer is 'because it's cheaper' for the 'university' that is in reality a bargain basement college in disguise.)

 I am trying to figure out what hurdles I can throw up to make cheating harder. I know I can't stop it, but I don't want students to be able to copy the exam into ChatGPT and get a passing grade without effort. I also don't want to have to submit 40 academic integrity reports if 40 out of 100 students submit obvious ChatGPT answers.

I have a few ideas:

1. Ask the students to hand-write their answers and upload pictures of their responses. (I'm aware they can simply copy from ChatGPT.)
2. Ask the students to annotate the journal article as they read through it and upload pictures of their annotations. (This seems like a pain in the ass to have to manage files when grading an exam.)

Neither of these seem great, and I have no idea how to write multiple choice questions on management that are cheat-proof. Has anyone had any ideas that have, in your experience, seen success?"
1866eub,1,2023-11-28,Analysis can make GPT worse at mathematical reasoning,u/PiranhaJAC,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1866eub/analysis_can_make_gpt_worse_at_mathematical/,"I gave ChatGPT-4 a version of the [Petersburg Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Petersburg_paradox). It correctly deduced that the equation for the expected value is:

> E=(1/2)×1+(1/4)×2+(1/8)×4+(1/16)×8+…

It then launched the Analysis tool, and wrote the following code:

> # Calculating the expected value of the series
> expected_value = sum([(1/2)**(n) * 2**(n-1) for n in range(1, 1000)])  # Large number for approximation
> expected_value
 
And confidently returned 499.5 as the answer. When I pointed out that the approach of finding an approximation by adding many terms is only valid for converging series, it then correctly inferred the divergence and gave a sound answer to the original riddle.

This is an illustrative error. ChatGPT behaved like a high-school maths student who has learned to use his scientific calculator and now everything remotely mathematical looks like a numeric equation to compute. It's perfectly within the mathematical reasoning abilities of GPT-4 to look at that E equation and see that it's an infinite divergent sum - I've verified this by giving it the same puzzle with Analysis turned off. But when tools are available it's over-eager to deploy its fancy computation toy, and it blindly believes the output without sense-checking."
186m2qv,100,2023-11-29,I'm beginning to see why my alma mater insisted on exams,u/anon_throwaway09557,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/186m2qv/im_beginning_to_see_why_my_alma_mater_insisted_on/,"I had a lot of exams when I was doing my undergrad and Master's. I thought that both the number (some courses had 4 exams) and the length of the exams (some of them were up to 3 hours) was excessive. However, now that I'm teaching, I see why. If you don't have exams, you can't be sure the students aren't cheating--whether it's copying from other students or using ChatGPT. Unless your coursework has some very specific technical questions that Google or ChatGPT won't be able to answer, chances are, at least some of them are cheating, especially students from certain countries where cheating is more widespread. 

Moreover, having exams prepares you for the world of work, where technical interviews are basically oral exams."
187k24r,2706,2023-11-30,Cheating with AI and Invisible Ink at the Same Time,u/BlackOrre,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/187k24r/cheating_with_ai_and_invisible_ink_at_the_same/,"One of the English teachers came to me one morning and asked me for one of the blacklights in the chemical storage closets. I don't normally interact with this teacher, so I asked why. The English teacher said she wanted to read invisible ink. I had one of those invisible ink pens with the light attached to it, so I gave it to her.

How this teacher operates is that she gives students 5 in-class essay prompts. The students are allowed to bring outlines to the in-class essay, but they are not allowed to bring anything else. They are required to submit the in-class essay along with their outlines. 

A student decided to write down entire essays in invisible ink on the back of the pages where the outlines were and used an invisible ink pen's light to see the essay and copy it down practically word-for-word. 

I said to the English teacher that at least the student put thought into the prompts and synthesized five essays. If only that knowledge stuck around in the student's head. 

The English teacher simply told me, ""Don't get your hopes up."" 

The student used ChatGPT to write the essays because they copied the ""Certainly! Here are ..."" They did this not only on the back of the outline but also on the actual in-class essay. 

This feels like a sitcom scenario. I'm not creative enough to make something like this up. I also will need to deal with this student in a few years."

187pbl2,1,2023-11-30,Chance a very anxious latino student for Cornell ED.,u/Advanced-Story8039,chanceme,https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/comments/187pbl2/chance_a_very_anxious_latino_student_for_cornell/,"I know we're 15 days away from the decision notification, but my anxiety has reached a maximum and I want to know what to expect. 

Intended major: Human Ecology; Human development

**Demographics:** Half Italian, half Peruvian

**Hooks:** I come from a very diverse family setting, with members from opposite career choices; I have a ""learning disability"" that was previously treated with medication and I worked very hard to overcome it as I decided to drop off the treatment.  

**Application type:** ED, international first year student

**Financial aid:** Middle household income; possible yearly contributions in the 30-40/year range. 

**Unweighted GPA:** 16.33/20 according to the Peruvian grading system (9th and 10 grade are tough because I was going through some issues with my treatment, but I ended 11th grade with a 18/20 unweighted GPA, and there's an overall very strong upwards trajectory)

**SAT:** 1480 (790 math and 690 R&W). I plant to take the SAT one more time in December and estimate a 1520-1550. This will be… practically useless for Cornell, though, lol. 

**Predicted IB score (I think I'll actually get a 41):** 42/45 (7s for English B HL, Business HL, Environmental systems and societies SL, and 6s for Physics HL, Spanish A SL, and Math AA SL). Also, I did my extended essay on Business. I applied with my predicted score.

**Activities:** 

Founded engineering club (11th and 12th grade)

Founded human ecology club (11th grade)

Founded two businesses and made 5k from sales (11th grade)

Invested my earnings so I could buy school stuff (11th grade)

**Essays:**

I told ChatGPT to grade them, and I got a 83/100 for the CommonApp's, 85/100 for the Cornell supplement, and 85/100 for the CHE essay. I did five trials for each and got the average score.

The only problem is, I made one rather obvious punctuation mistake in the CommonApp essay and a typo for the CHE essay. 

**Recommendation letters:**

I got one from my Physics teacher, who knows me for three years. I'm very confident it's in the 80-90/100 range. 

I got the other one from my environmental systems and societies teacher, who also knows me for three years. Like with my Physics teacher, we created a very nice bond, so I'm estimating it's in the 80-90/100 range. She hinted that I should feel very satisfied with her recommendation letter.  "
187qumn,1,2023-11-30,(Productive) AI education for educators. What do we need?,u/GFOTY916,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/187qumn/productive_ai_education_for_educators_what_do_we/,"I know I know, professional development meetings are not always popular among teachers, and (at least in my experience) are sometimes a waste of time to meet some bureaucratic regulations. BUT, I notice a trend of lack of education, or accessibility to the education, around AI for teachers. I know we were all talking (mostly negatively) about ChatGPT and its potential harms in the classroom this past year. A lot of teachers I know have a defeatist, or fear based mindset towards AI in general. If we could have an effective, productive sort of PD or workshop for teachers, led by a researcher in the actual AI field, what would you prefer that look like? What questions would you want answered? 

  
I'll start - I'd love to have a session just brainstorming mindful ways to incorporate ChatGPT into lesson plans - something like having the student write an essay to a prompt, and then give the same prompt to ChatGPT, and observe the differences. This could be an opportunity for the student to learn about and develop their own unique voice and writing style, provide a mirror for content they may have missed, as well as a chance to critique any shortcomings of the ChatGPT's response. As a mirror and/or a collaborator, AI is an amazing tool for artistic creation. It's not going away, so the fear-based avoidance is anything but solution-based, in my opinion. 

What issues would you like to discuss, if a PD like that existed? What questions would you want answered? Do you think there's a gap between the (often, gate-kept) AI/tech industry and education sectors? If your district funded an opportunity to attend a tech/AI conference, would you embrace it?

(For context, if it matters, I'm a prior high school English teacher and now do consulting in Trust and Safety for tech companies around humanitarian issues. So that's where my curiosity about this is coming from.)

TLDR:  If we could have an effective, productive sort of PD or workshop for teachers, led by a researcher in the actual AI field, what would you prefer that look like? What questions would you want answered? "
