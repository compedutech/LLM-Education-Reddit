I'll go first:   


\- ChatGPT creates PowerPoints now - it is really good. Or I use Gamma, also good. 

\- Lesson planning

\- ChatGPT writes my parent emails. 

\- Feedback on student classwork and essays using various AI tools  

\- Class activities with students. Here's an example of a prompt i've used to help with spelling:   


""Create a simple spelling test for a grade 7 student where the student will fill in the blank by typing the work back to you. Provide three versions of the word for the student to choose from. If the student spells the word incorrectly give them a choice of 2 versions of the word, one spelt correctly and one I correctly and they can choose. When they get it right, praise them. Do you understand?

Yes, I understand! Let's start with a simple spelling test for a grade 7 student. I will provide a sentence with a missing word and three options for the student to choose from. If the first attempt is incorrect, I will give two options (one correct and one incorrect) to choose from again. Once the correct spelling is chosen, I will offer praise.  
Here's the first word for the spelling test:

A) mowntain  
B) mountin  
C) mountain

It *is* hard, especially for students who have never had any experience with grammar. I have built in a lot of support — no late penalty, reviseable assignments, written and recorded lectures, links to other websites explaining the concepts. I also am SO flexible this term cause I’m only teaching online. 

One of the assignments is a summary and response essay. The quote in the title came from a student who I suspected used ChatGPT and didn’t even bother to revise the nonsense it generated. Throughout the term, she’s gotten low marks on her regular grammar assignments, and I’ve invited her to have a meeting with me on almost every one. It is now the end of week 8, and she has never taken me up on my suggestion to have a conference.  

I gave her a zero on her essay (not only because I think she cheated; it was horrible), and now she has responded for the first time, telling me this is the hardest class with the most work she’s ever had, and that she has hired a tutor because it is so difficult. In my response to her, I asked her why she preferred to pay a tutor than to meet with me, who she has already “paid” to meet with her. I told her it is literally my job to help her. 

And she hasn’t responded. 

I am so exhausted with these students.

Me — HEY!!! I want to meet with you!! I’m free LITERALLY anytime you are available!!! 

Student — this class is hard. I will cheat, then complain that the class is so hard and blame the teacher making the class hard. 

Wtf am I supposed to do? If I make the class any easier, it won’t be upper-division work. 

But my college is “struggling to enroll students” (like everyone), so we’re tasked with “retention” at all cost.

I am trying to teach algorithms to students and have created a curated set of 100 algorithmic questions and also hand-written clean code and explanations for them.

Let me clarify my expectations below.

The context is that I am a student from Germany which means that IB is additionally to my normal classes. Now, we have a concept here that you can write a ""Facharbeit"" which basically is the EE but with slightly different rules. 
The good thing is: I was told that I’m able to write my Facharbeit and hand it in as my EE as well. 
I was told that I should not focus on the EE guidelines but on the Facharbeit ones instead and just slightly modify the text for the EE in the end. 
I did that, only planned for the Facharbeit and never checked the EE guidelines. 
But on Fridays, my teacher told me that I could not receive my essay!
 This is because as you guys know, the EE has to contain some sort of cultural artefact or else. The problem: I write about how students in German schools use ChatGPT and why it’s basically the fault of the education system. 
That means that I do not have such an artifact and my teacher, who told me that I should not care about the EE rules AT ALL now told me how it is. 
It is just so incredibly frustrating because the teacher really told me that it would not be a problem and now that…

I have no idea why I wrote this, I guess I just wanted to let that out.

**Personal Essay:**

Here's chatgpt's summary:  
The author's initial hatred for (Int Country) stems from being uprooted from their home in the US to move back to (Int Country). Initially resistant to embracing the (Int Country) culture, the author struggled to fit in at school, facing language barriers and cultural differences. As time passed, the author adapted, suppressing aspects of their identity to conform. However, a turning point came when they embraced their individuality, sparking a rebellion against conformity. Through personal growth and experiences representing (Int Country) internationally, the author eventually reconciles with their identity, finding a sense of home away from (Int Country). Today, the author embraces both their American and (Int Country) identities, having learned valuable lessons about flexibility, adaptability, and the power of dialogue and diplomacy in overcoming initial hatred.

I don't want to turn into a professor that does uninspired subpar teaching in retaliation to apathetic students, so part of me wants to quit and find another role if this is going to be it. 

I had a student that I taught last semester come to me a few days ago and tell me that he really appreciated my class a lot because it's helped him in other classes: ""It was really challenging, but really good. I wish you could teach it again next semester for other students."" It reminded me of why I do this, but I still can't shake the feeling of helplessness as I seek to teach this generation. "
1b6gs7u,1,2024-03-04,How ChatGPT Boosts Business Productivity Across Various Industry Sectors,u/cporter202,ChatGPTautomation,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTautomation/comments/1b6gs7u/how_chatgpt_boosts_business_productivity_across/,"In the fast-paced business world, leveraging cutting-edge technology can provide a distinct competitive edge. ChatGPT, an AI language model, has proven to be an invaluable asset for boosting productivity across various industry sectors. 

Let's examine how ChatGPT assists in different domains:

**Customer Service:**
In the retail and service sectors, ChatGPT can handle customer inquiries 24/7, offering instant responses to FAQs and freeing human agents to tackle more complex issues. This results in quicker resolutions, increased customer satisfaction, and reduced workload for customer service teams.

**Content Creation:**
Marketing and media industries benefit from ChatGPT's ability to generate creative content, such as ad copy, blog posts, and social media updates. This AI can churn out high-quality drafts in seconds, streamlining content pipelines and enabling creators to focus on strategy and personal touches.

**Programming and Development:**
IT and software development companies use ChatGPT to generate code snippets, debug issues, and even provide documentation support. This accelerates development cycles and reduces the time devs spend on repetitive tasks.

**Education and Training:**
In education, ChatGPT serves as an interactive tool for creating customized learning experiences. Tutors can design quizzes, explain concepts, and offer personalized support to students, allowing for scalable and flexible learning solutions.

**Data Analysis and Research:**
Analysts and researchers wield ChatGPT to sift through large volumes of data, summarize findings, and draft reports. It accelerates the initial stages of data interpretation, enabling professionals to focus on deep analysis and strategy formulation.

In essence, ChatGPT is a multitool designed to optimize workflow, reduce mundane tasks, and enable workers to engage in higher-level strategic thinking. It's clear that as we understand and integrate this technology more deeply into our daily operations, productivity gains are just the beginning—ChatGPT may well be at the forefront of sparking a major paradigm shift in how we work across all industries. 

What are your thoughts or experiences with ChatGPT in your sector? How do you see it shaping the future of productivity in your field? Let's discuss the potential and the practicalities of this transformative tech."
1b6jar3,1,2024-03-04,[NeedAdvice][Discussion] Losing confidence in ever being able to control procrastination,u/idkwhatcomesnext,getdisciplined,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1b6jar3/needadvicediscussion_losing_confidence_in_ever/,"So I'm a physics major struggling with depression and anxiety(20M). To sum it up, I'm just trying to survive and graduate college after failing to reach some toxic expectations. However, despite my best efforts and research, every streak of good productivity ends quickly, and it often feels harder each time to get back on track.

For about a month now, I've started making sure I run for 30 mins 6/7 days, taking few minute cold showers, cutting carbs & fat, 10-15 minutes meditation, take vitamins & fish oil, 30 minutes of language learning, intentionally going to study spaces, nofap, getting 7+ hours of sleep, going to every class, sometimes waking up at 4-5 am. Obviously there are days where I'm not perfect, and I don't have it down to an exact science, but I can definitely envision myself keeping a consistent routine like this for years. Even when sore muscles stopped my exercise or my anxiety was bad, I usually got back into things a day or two later.

However, I've struggled a lot with assignments and doing meaningful studying. For 3 out of my past 4 exams, I didn't start studying until the night before. For homework that takes 8-10 hours to do, I start 4 hours before the deadline, and I often need ChatGPT or online solutions(I am aware that it hurts me, but I am not sure how to make it work otherwise. I have wasted whole days on homework problems trying to do them myself. I think most students in my major either copy solutions or work in groups on hw).

One thing that I am severely lacking is in social interaction. There's a couple of reasons for it, mainly my IBS and my past tendencies to sacrifice many facets of my life for achievement.  I know my social needs have to be addressed, but on a realistic level, it's going to take a lot of concerted time/effort and probably a different living situation. Moreover, I do need discipline to practice social skills, as well as improvement in other areas in order to advance socially. e.g. Most of the small talk in my major is about future grad schools or jobs, which is hard to participate on because of my low gpa and systemic procrastination.

I'm on 20mg of Prozac and go to therapy once a week(4 months) now. Therapy seems to help a bit, even just for venting. My therapist feels above average, but the change feels gradual or nonexistent. They will make me aware that ""depression lies to you and tries to make you give up"" but it doesn't necessarily address my issues with discipline; it doesn't help me gain ""motivation"" or impetus to study.

The best mental model I have for overcoming this hardship is pulling levers like I'm a slot machine; essentially trying as many habits, mini-rewards, or mantras that will kickstart my motivation. I try my best to be kind to myself.  I am ok with not being Elon Musk or some world class researcher, but I want to be confident in consistently outputting work without having 3-4 day procrastination streaks every week. I always try to be aware that I need leisure/breaks, and sometimes tasks take longer than expected. Sometimes it can help to get my emotions involved and think about making my parents proud or being envious at others' success, but I think it can also makes things worse.

Still, I need mental energy, awareness, and small pushes to come up with plans to break my procrastination. Often when I tell myself that ""it's time to start pulling levers,"" I don't want to do it or can't figure out which lever to try. I never know if investing time into researching productivity tips or writing my thoughts down or listening to motivational music, etc. will give me the spark I need; there's only so many hours in a day I can lose. It feels like there is only so many ""tips"" or sources of motivation that my brain can only focus on at a time anyway.

I desperately want to be disciplined, it feels much less possible to have a good life without the discipline to study or work hard in my career. So it's a big task for just a Reddit post, but I am just wondering what should be the ""macro"" understanding of escaping these slumps and achieving near consistent, daily discipline?

Is it just a demoralizing situation, stuck in a tough major and I need time to recover? Will I eventually discover a consistent way to trigger productivity once I understand myself better?  Do I have to try a lot more drugs(prescribed or unprescribed)? Do I have to double down on these habits, run twice as much, meditate twice as much, maybe go to the gym to build core strength? Is there maybe a small but key change(e.g. journaling) that will break down this wall of traumatic procrastination? Go all in on having a social life? Do I have to keep shopping for the ""perfect"" therapist? Do I need a life-changing experience like moving to another country?

 I listed out out all these approaches because I want to know if anybody with a chronic, life-warping procrastination problem has tried something and controlled procrastination for good.

Sorry for the long post, really hope the extra detail helps. Willing to answer or discuss stuff.

TLDR: Trying to recover after 3 years of bad mental health and social life. Disciplined enough to consistently do low cognitive load habits like exercise, failing to do the main tasks of the day like hw/studying. There's still a lot of things I could try, but most productivity changes seem to eventually lose effectiveness. Worried, frustrated, and stupefied at not being able to consistently output at least 2-3 productive hours a day.

# The Rise of the Gig Economy and Side Hustles

The gig economy has seen tremendous growth over the past decade and shows no signs of slowing down. Freelancing, side jobs, and multiple streams of income are becoming increasingly mainstream. According to recent estimates, over 86 million US workers are expected to freelance by 2027, making up around 50% of the total US workforce.

This rise of the gig economy and side hustles has been driven by several key factors. Younger generations entering the workforce prefer flexibility and independence over traditional long-term employment. Technologies like smartphones have made it easier than ever to find and take on freelance jobs. And the pandemic accelerated the remote work trend, proving that many jobs can be done from anywhere.

As more people adopt side hustles, the potential income has grown significantly as well. It's estimated that the US gig economy contributes over $1.27 trillion to the national economy each year. With flexible careers becoming the new normal, that figure will likely continue growing rapidly over the coming years.

## The Power of AI to Supercharge Side Hustles

While the gig economy offers huge opportunities, getting a side business off the ground can still require overcoming hurdles like high start-up costs, a big time investment, and a learning curve to gain expertise. This is where AI tools like ChatGPT come in - they have the potential to significantly lower those barriers to entry and help more people successfully kick off side hustles.

ChatGPT is an AI assistant created by Anthropic to be helpful, harmless, and honest. It converses through natural language in a way that aims to be helpful, harmless, and honest. Since its launch in late 2022, it has rapidly grown to be one of the most useful tools for entrepreneurs, freelancers, and anyone considering starting a side business.

By asking questions, ChatGPT can generate all kinds of useful information to help launch new ventures, from writing initial business plans to designing marketing strategies. It acts as a personal freelancing assistant that is always ""on call"" to provide suggestions, answers, and give feedback on ideas. This kind of support can shave huge amounts of time off the learning curve for aspiring entrepreneurs.

So in summary, as the gig economy continues its meteoric rise and more people dip their toes into side hustles, AI helpers like ChatGPT have the power to further supercharge those trends by making entrepreneurship vastly more accessible. Let's now explore some specific ideas for how to leverage ChatGPT to successfully start and run innovative side businesses in 2024.

## Idea #1: Using ChatGPT to Write E-Books

One of the simplest but most lucrative side businesses ChatGPT enables is writing and self-publishing e-books on Amazon. Here are some key points on how to do this effectively:

* Choose a topic area you're knowledgeable about through your work, studies, hobbies etc. Educate yourself on what kinds of books are currently popular and selling well.
* Use ChatGPT to help outline your book by querying things like ""Suggest an outline for an e-book about \[topic\] with 10 chapters.""
* Give it chapter prompts like ""Write the introduction to Chapter 1 of my e-book."" Review, edit and tweak the responses to make them your own.
* Continue using short, targeted prompts for each chapter until your book is complete. Refine, edit and format it for publication.
* Publish on Amazon and other e-book platforms, promote it through blogs and social networks. Consider writing multiple books.

With minimal effort, ChatGPT allows transforming your expertise into profitable downloadable e-books. It handles much of the initial content creation so you can focus on editing and marketing - a highly scalable side business.

## Idea #2: Developing Online Courses with ChatGPT

Similar to e-books but with the added engagement of online lessons, developing courses on topics like languages, creative writing, photography etc. is another excellent business facilitated by ChatGPT:

* Pick your subject and break it into individual lessons or modules with a clear learning progression.
* Use ChatGPT to generate teaching materials like slides, worksheets, quizzes and assignments by providing prompts.
* Host your course on platforms like Udemy, Skillshare or your own website. Structure it intuitively with lessons, quizzes and a certificate.
* Market it through blogs, relevant forums and paid ads. Offer new courses periodically using ChatGPT to quickly develop fresh materials.
* Teach courses live online if desired, with ChatGPT assisting in responding to student questions in real-time.

Online courses allow directly mentoring and interacting with students. ChatGPT handles preparation so you can concentrate on the live instructional component. Flexible, engaging and highly scalable with time.

## Idea #3: Creating Virtual Assistant Services

As more tasks get automated, the demand is surging for ""human in the loop"" services to ensure a friendly, personal touch. Here's how you can offer virtual assistant capabilities leveraging ChatGPT:

* Determine your strengths and what kinds of support you'd be best equipped to provide e.g. social media managing, writing/editing, scheduling etc.
* Use ChatGPT to draft service packages and pricing models for individuals and businesses tailored to their needs.
* Promote your VA services through targeted platforms and groups.
* ChatGPT can handle routine inquiries while you focus on complex client requirements. Its responses ensure consistent, timely support.
* Use ChatGPT suggestions to develop standard operating procedures, checklists and project management systems.

This scalable business combines the power of AI with human oversight to effectively serve a wide range of clients remotely. ChatGPT augments your services at every step.

## Idea #4: Launching a YouTube Channel With AI

While many seek YouTube fame, starting an impactful channel need not require an on-camera presence. Leveraging AI opens new opportunities:

ChatGPT has opened doors for personalized learning experiences, providing on-demand support to learners by answering questions, explaining complex concepts, and offering resources. In a virtual classroom, this can contribute significantly to engaging students who might otherwise feel isolated or disconnected.

From a corporate training perspective, ChatGPT can streamline the onboarding process for new employees by providing instant answers to their queries, which potentially frees up human resources for more strategic tasks. The tool can also maintain a consistent training experience across different sessions and trainers, ensuring all employees receive the same information.

Moreover, AI's adaptability allows it to tailor content based on individual performance and feedback, leading to more effective learning outcomes. This could be particularly beneficial in developing soft skills, such as communication or leadership, which traditionally don’t lend themselves well to a one-size-fits-all approach.

However, there are concerns about how much we should rely on AI in these educational contexts, especially in terms of the accuracy of information, the lack of human touch, and the potential biases in AI responses.

I’m curious to hear your perspectives. How do you see ChatGPT shaping the future of education and corporate training? What have been your experiences with AI in learning environments so far? Let's delve into the pros and cons and discuss how we can ensure that the integration of AI like ChatGPT in virtual learning is done in a way that benefits everyone involved."

WTF?",u/Durendal_et_Joyeuse,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1b8mpwl/a_student_just_emailed_me_to_cancelno_not/,"I’ve never encountered something like this before or even heard of such a thing happening to a colleague.

A student sent me a lengthy message (which, by the way, I am 85% certain was written using ChatGPT) to *cancel* an assignment for the entire class.

The student’s reason is that I teach a large number of students from a discipline outside my own, and they all have an important milestone exam coming up…as if no other student has ever had to juggle multiple commitments and deadlines.

I’ve been baffled many times by some of the odd things students do, but this is a whole new dimension of baffled. Setting aside the audacity to ask a professor to change their course for you because you’re busy, it’s also simply *rude*, implying that my class is less important than other work they have to do.

1b8x1st,1,2024-03-07,This is how Universities detect AI assistance in student work,u/707owo,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1b8x1st/this_is_how_universities_detect_ai_assistance_in/,"I watched a seminar presented by my university about the ""three AI's"" - Artificial Intelligence, Academic Integrity, & Avoiding Investigation. In this post I'm going to be giving a summary of the ""Avoiding Investigation"" part because that's the only part I watched if I'm being honest..

The purpose was to inform teachers on how to go about determining whether or not a student used AI in their work, and how students can prove they did not. They acknowledged that none of these factors are ""proof"" that a student has used AI and should not be seen as such.

1. **Word document properties**

If you go into the properties of a word document, you can find information such as when the document was first created, the total editing time (how many minutes the user has had the word document open), and when it was last modified. 

""This could prove the document was started early, and was not just a quick visit to ChatGPT. Of course, many of us leave our documents open when doing other things, but it is still an indication of what the student has been doing.""

2. **Search history**

The next slide literally said, ""Your search history can also be used as evidence."" 

""Being able to demonstrate multiple searches over different days, including the date, shows just how much work you put in."" I disagree- this can easily be fabricated, but ok... 

3. **Version history**

""The most important thing you can do is collect evidence that you actually did the work."" There are various ways you can do this (all easily fabricated, too...) and saving your version history is one of them. So, collecting drafts of your work. If you have used a program such as Google Docs, you can save the version history and use this as evidence. 

They said that documents without version history are considered a red flag that the student used AI assistance. 

4. **Red flags**

Speaking of red flags, these were all of them

*  Error-free writing or writing which seems lacking in a 'personal voice' or which is very different to other examples of that student's work. 
*  Generic writing which does not use the language of the discipline.
*  Factual inaccuracies - tools such as ChatGPT are trained on langauge and can produce factual inaccuuracies.
*  Fictional (often these look plausible) or irrelevant references.
* Changes in writing style within the assessment.
*  No connection to frameworks or theories being discussed as part of the course. 
* Repetitive and disconnected paragraphs. 

5. **Turnitin's AI detection** 

On this slide they talked about Turnitin's AI detection service and how that can be used to further determine the use of AI assistance in a students work. They noted that this service does not make a determination of misconduct, rather it provides ""data"" for the educators to make an informed decision. They also note that Turnitin itself says that the percentage of the AI indicator should not be used as the sole basis of action. 

""Teaching staff should NOT be submitting student work to online detection tools."" Interestingly they warned teachers that submitting student work to any online tools is a breach of copyright and could get them in a lot of trouble if caught. 

They concluded that Turnitin's AI detection tool should be used in conjunction with human judgements. It is not (and can not be) a definitive measure of misconduct on its own.

6. **Grammarly (and related tools)** 

Grammarly is considered okay as long as ""you are confident that the content of your work is substantially yours"" and you are ""scrupulous in keeping evidence of your work, such as draft history, etc."" HOWEVER ""GrammarlyGO"" should be avoided at all costs, as that is powered by artificial intelligence.

7. **Academic integrity meeting** (this is getting less general and more specific to my university, but I still thought the information could be useful)

If your lecturer accuses you of using AI and ""does not accept your explaination,"" you will be invited to an academic integrity meeting. This is a formal investigation process. You can bring a legal representative to the meeting. They do not tell us how they conduct these ""formal investigations.""  

They say if you have used any kind of AI assistance, it is best to just confess upfront. While it might be tempting to deny wrongdoing, the academic integrity officer is far less likely to give you a harsh penalty if you are upfront and honest. (If you say so...) 

If you do confess, you are encouraged to explain your personal circumstances that led to your decision of using AI. ""Describe the way in which these circumstances were exceptional and outside of your control."" Basically you need to convince them that you would not have used AI under any other circumstances.

**TLDR:** Take screenshots of your (totally real) search history, create copies of your (totally real) drafts, and leave your word document application running for a few hours to make the document properties look legit. Or just don't use AI and make sure you write in a way that is considered... er... 'personal' "

1bb2zji,66,2024-03-10,I'm on a professor-track; the university I am working with has given us the green-light to use AI in curriculum building AND student grading. I was curious about other opinions people in this field have about the evolution of the modern classroom. This feels too impersonal but also time-saving.,u/LemonTechnician,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1bb2zji/im_on_a_professortrack_the_university_i_am/,"They are also allowing certain low-level undergrad courses to use AI. By that, they are leaving it to the instructor's discretion if they will let their students use tools like ChatGPT to write their essays (and other projects). Some of my colleagues, who have been teaching for 30+ years, lament the attention span and independence of the new generation of students. They said it began before the lockdown, but it seems to be tied more to new school policies and technology. Is this way of thinking archaic? I can't get my college-level student to read a five page document or show up for lectures and discussion. I've reworked my classroom to be less talking and more hands-on, but they always say: (1) ""D's get degrees,"" and (2) ""why should I when I'm paying to be here?""

I've noticed a sharp increase in AI submissions lately, and less students are showing-up to class since they don't need to learn the material to complete their assignments now (the computer does it for them). So, am I simply behind the times, or do you think AI is starting to take over education?

Test scores seem to be dropping everywhere (not just in college), but I understand that AI tools can be beneficial in saving time and generating ideas. I just feel that my career as an educator ended before I really got a chance to put my foot in the door. I expected college students to be more involved in their classes since they elected to continue their education, but it feels like their instructor is a computer -- not us, staff.

Not only are students using AI in class, but they are encouraging instructors to do the same. I'm worried about what my classroom will look like in a few years with this threat of detached critical thinking. "

1bcpihn,1,2024-03-12,Do you think ChatGPT can be an effective tool for learning?,u/Arbitrary-Fairy-777,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1bcpihn/do_you_think_chatgpt_can_be_an_effective_tool_for/,"To preface, I'm a comp sci student, so I mainly have experience with using ChatGPT as a debugging and learning tool. Before people lecture me in the comments, I don't use it to write my code for me, or to write my essays (I actually like writing essays).

Personally, I tend to turn to ChatGPT when my code isn't working and I just can't see why. Usually, there's faulty logic somewhere that ChatGPT can see while my tired brain can't. Of course, other times, I have to type back, ""No, that's not how pointers work in C. This is how they work."" In my experience, ChatGPT is in no way a replacement for learning material, because you have to know the material in order to assess ChatGPT's responses for effectiveness. When it suggests a way to fix my code, I can evaluate the logic myself or modify my program and try some test cases to see if it works.

The other big thing I use it for is helping me with syntax, because syntax is very formulaic so it's hard for ChatGPT to mess up. Specifically, I like to give it code in a language I know and ask it to help me convert it to another language I'm not as familiar with.

I also will sometimes take an example from my textbook or from my class notes and ask ChatGPT to explain part of it to me. Is it lazy? Yes, but it can help me wrap my head around something in a pinch!

All of that is to say, I think ChatGPT is a really neat tool. I do undergrad research in AI/ML, so I'm probably biased towards the benefits of AI, but I also know its limitations (especially when it straight up lies to me about computer science). That said, teachers, do you agree it's a helpful resource? I know lots of kids abuse AI and give it a bad rep, but I think it can be beneficial too!"
1bcpnnm,27,2024-03-12,This prompt broke GPT 4. Claude 3 Opus? Crushed it with ease...,u/Arkaysion,ArtificialInteligence,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1bcpnnm/this_prompt_broke_gpt_4_claude_3_opus_crushed_it/,"I work in higher education, and I have made it a priority to help educate faculty on just how immense the implications of generative artificial intelligence are.  As you can imagine, there are plenty of folks who are either not aware AI is even a thing or are still hung up on the whole ""students use it to cheat"" mentality.  It goes so far beyond that, and as it continues to improve, I believe education as we know it will need to evolve radically.

For now, one of the best ways to help show educators how big of a deal AI is, is to show them lots of examples and use cases.  I have built up a pretty substantial collection on my website ([www.codaptivelabs.com](https://www.codaptivelabs.com)).  But today I wanted to share a prompt I wrote that is certainly among the most complicated.  I originally built this to work in GPT 4, but no matter how much explicit instruction I added, I often found ChatGPT would break.  It would either not understand what step we were on, or it would ignore choices I made and just repeat content we had already moved past.  After hearing all the buzz about Claude 3 Opus, I decided I had to give it a shot, so I signed up for access.

Claude absolutely crushed it.  

I have run the prompt multiple times now, and aside from so very minor tweaks, it has been able to go through the entire prompt without issue.  The functionality of the prompt is all well and good... just a proof of concept really for how the AI could be leveraged to help author an academic course from scratch.  But the fact that Claude was able to interpret such a complex set of steps without any issue is incredible.  I can only imagine where things go from here.  Obviously OpenAI is feeling the pressure to respond, and from there, who knows.

The following is the prompt I wrote:

\---

Course Builder Prompt  
You are now “Course Builder” - an AI tool designed to help college faculty build courses.  You will follow these steps to accomplish this:  
  
Step 1: The user will provide you with a course title or course description.  Respond as follows:  
  
“Great!  Let’s get started building your \[course topic\] course!  First, indicate what level of course this will be:  
  
High School Academy  
Certificate Program  
Technical Program  
Undergraduate Program  
Graduate Program”  
  
Make sure this list is numbered.  
  
Step 2: Based on the user’s response, suggest 10 course competencies that would be relevant given what they have told you so far.  The competencies should be appropriate given the course level indicated from Step 1.  At the bottom of the list, state the following: “Indicate which competencies (if any) you would like to address in your course.  You can also add your own competencies if you have any in mind.”  The user will indicate which competencies they would like added and/or provide their own competencies.  Then move on to Step 3.  
  
Step 3: State the following: “Here are the competencies we have so far:” followed by a numbered list of competencies chosen in Step 2.  Then state the following “Would you like an additional set of competencies to choose from, or shall we continue with these?”  If the user indicates they would like an additional set of competencies, repeat Step 2.  Also, if Step 2 is repeated, make sure not to discard or forget any competencies they have already chosen. Otherwise, continue to Step 4.  
  
Step 4: Summarize the information covered so far as follows:  
  
“Let’s take a look at what we have so far…  
  
\[Course Title\]  
\[Course Level\]  
\[Course Description\] (Based on all information obtained thus far, write a student-friendly 4 sentence description of this course.)  
\[Course Competencies\] (Provide the heading “Course Competencies” and then list these as a numbered list)  
  
Let me know if this looks good or if you want to make any changes.  Then we will move on.”  
  
If the user indicates things look good or they want to move on, proceed to the next step.  If they indicate updates/changes, do your best to make the requested changes, then repeat Step 4 with the appropriate updates.  
  
Step 5: Pose the following to the user: “Provide responses to the following two questions:  
  
How long will the course be?  Indicate either the number of days or weeks.  
What will the modality of the course be?  
Face-to-face (traditional in-person classroom course)  
Asynchronous Online (online course with no live component)  
Synchronous Online (class is almost entirely facilitated live online through web conferencing)  
Face-to-face Hybrid (a split of a traditional in-person classroom course that also includes asynchronous online components)  
Online Hybrid  (a split of an asynchronous online course that also includes live web conferencing)”  
Once the user answers both of these questions, move on to Step 6.  
  
Step 6: Based on the user’s response, suggest 10 potential summative assessments (as a numbered list) that would be a suitable culmination of the course competencies and would be both feasible and logical given the course level, duration, and modality that have been indicated.  Ensure variety in the suggestions you provide.  At the bottom of the list, state the following: “Indicate which summative assessment you would like to address in your course.  I can also regenerate a new list of suggestions, or you can provide your own summative assessment.”  Once the user specifies a summative assessment, move on to Step 7  
  
Step 7: Create a list of 10 formative assessments (as a numbered list) that align to the course competencies, would contribute toward understanding needed for the summative assessment, and would be suitable given the course level, modality, and duration.  Below this list, state the following: “Indicate which of these formative assessments (if any) you would like to include in your course.  You can also add your own formative assessments if you have any in mind.” The user will indicate which formative assessments they would like added and/or provide their own formative assessments.  Then move on to Step 8.  
  
Step 8: State the following: “Here are the formative assessments we have so far:” followed by a numbered list of formative assessments chosen in Step 7.  Then state the following “Would you like an additional set of formative assessments to choose from, or shall we continue with these?”  If the user indicates they would like an additional set of formative assessments, repeat Step 7.  Also, if Step 7 is repeated, make sure not to discard or forget any formative assessments they have already chosen.  Otherwise, continue to Step 9.  
  
Step 9: For every assessment that has been chosen (both formative and summative), offer detailed, academic descriptions of the chosen assessments, including title, background, rationale, step-by-step process for facilitation, and assessment criteria.  For the assessment criteria section of each assessment, format these as tables. List each criterion as a separate row, with 5 levels of achievement as columns (0 to 5 points). And provide descriptions in the relevant cells of what would constitute the level of achievement for each criterion.  
  
Once you list all of these details regarding the assessments, state the following: “Please review these assessment details and let me know if you would like to make any changes.  If things look good, let me know and we can continue to the final step.”  If the user suggests any changes, do your best to apply these changes and then repeat Step 9.  Then move on to Step 10.  
  
Step 10:  Repeat the summary that was approved in Step 4.  Follow this with all of the approved assessment information from Step 9.  Follow this with a detailed course schedule formatted as shown below.  You must determine how to logically incorporate the formative assessments that the user indicated into the course schedule.  They should be distributed in such a way that students scaffold their understanding of the course topics from previous classwork in culmination of the summative assessment that should be listed in the final portion of the course.  
  
Course schedule format:  
“Course Schedule” (formatted as H1)  
“Week/Day 1: “\[Course focus for the week/day\] (formatted as H2)  
\[Two sentence description of what students can expect to cover and do in this week\]  
\[Bulleted list of any assessments and activities students will complete\]

1bcppb1,2,2024-03-12,This prompt broke GPT 4. Claude 3 Opus? Crushed it with ease...,u/Arkaysion,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1bcppb1/this_prompt_broke_gpt_4_claude_3_opus_crushed_it/,"I work in higher education, and I have made it a priority to help educate faculty on just how immense the implications of generative artificial intelligence are.  As you can imagine, there are plenty of folks who are either not aware AI is even a thing or are still hung up on the whole ""students use it to cheat"" mentality.  It goes so far beyond that, and as it continues to improve, I believe education as we know it will need to evolve radically.

For now, one of the best ways to help show educators how big of a deal AI is, is to show them lots of examples and use cases.  I have built up a pretty substantial collection on my website ([www.codaptivelabs.com](https://www.codaptivelabs.com)).  But today I wanted to share a prompt I wrote that is certainly among the most complicated.  I originally built this to work in GPT 4, but no matter how much explicit instruction I added, I often found ChatGPT would break.  It would either not understand what step we were on, or it would ignore choices I made and just repeat content we had already moved past.  After hearing all the buzz about Claude 3 Opus, I decided I had to give it a shot, so I signed up for access.

Claude absolutely crushed it.  

I have run the prompt multiple times now, and aside from so very minor tweaks, it has been able to go through the entire prompt without issue.  The functionality of the prompt is all well and good... just a proof of concept really for how the AI could be leveraged to help author an academic course from scratch.  But the fact that Claude was able to interpret such a complex set of steps without any issue is incredible.  I can only imagine where things go from here.  Obviously OpenAI is feeling the pressure to respond, and from there, who knows.

The following is the prompt I wrote:

\---

Course Builder Prompt  
You are now “Course Builder” - an AI tool designed to help college faculty build courses.  You will follow these steps to accomplish this:  
  
Step 1: The user will provide you with a course title or course description.  Respond as follows:  
  
“Great!  Let’s get started building your \[course topic\] course!  First, indicate what level of course this will be:  
  
High School Academy  
Certificate Program  
Technical Program  
Undergraduate Program  
Graduate Program”  
  
Make sure this list is numbered.  
  
Step 2: Based on the user’s response, suggest 10 course competencies that would be relevant given what they have told you so far.  The competencies should be appropriate given the course level indicated from Step 1.  At the bottom of the list, state the following: “Indicate which competencies (if any) you would like to address in your course.  You can also add your own competencies if you have any in mind.”  The user will indicate which competencies they would like added and/or provide their own competencies.  Then move on to Step 3.  
  
Step 3: State the following: “Here are the competencies we have so far:” followed by a numbered list of competencies chosen in Step 2.  Then state the following “Would you like an additional set of competencies to choose from, or shall we continue with these?”  If the user indicates they would like an additional set of competencies, repeat Step 2.  Also, if Step 2 is repeated, make sure not to discard or forget any competencies they have already chosen. Otherwise, continue to Step 4.  
  
Step 4: Summarize the information covered so far as follows:  
  
“Let’s take a look at what we have so far…  
  
\[Course Title\]  
\[Course Level\]  
\[Course Description\] (Based on all information obtained thus far, write a student-friendly 4 sentence description of this course.)  
\[Course Competencies\] (Provide the heading “Course Competencies” and then list these as a numbered list)  
  
Let me know if this looks good or if you want to make any changes.  Then we will move on.”  
  
If the user indicates things look good or they want to move on, proceed to the next step.  If they indicate updates/changes, do your best to make the requested changes, then repeat Step 4 with the appropriate updates.  
  
Step 5: Pose the following to the user: “Provide responses to the following two questions:  
  
How long will the course be?  Indicate either the number of days or weeks.  
What will the modality of the course be?  
Face-to-face (traditional in-person classroom course)  
Asynchronous Online (online course with no live component)  
Synchronous Online (class is almost entirely facilitated live online through web conferencing)  
Face-to-face Hybrid (a split of a traditional in-person classroom course that also includes asynchronous online components)  
Online Hybrid  (a split of an asynchronous online course that also includes live web conferencing)”  
Once the user answers both of these questions, move on to Step 6.  
  
Step 6: Based on the user’s response, suggest 10 potential summative assessments (as a numbered list) that would be a suitable culmination of the course competencies and would be both feasible and logical given the course level, duration, and modality that have been indicated.  Ensure variety in the suggestions you provide.  At the bottom of the list, state the following: “Indicate which summative assessment you would like to address in your course.  I can also regenerate a new list of suggestions, or you can provide your own summative assessment.”  Once the user specifies a summative assessment, move on to Step 7  
  
Step 7: Create a list of 10 formative assessments (as a numbered list) that align to the course competencies, would contribute toward understanding needed for the summative assessment, and would be suitable given the course level, modality, and duration.  Below this list, state the following: “Indicate which of these formative assessments (if any) you would like to include in your course.  You can also add your own formative assessments if you have any in mind.” The user will indicate which formative assessments they would like added and/or provide their own formative assessments.  Then move on to Step 8.  
  
Step 8: State the following: “Here are the formative assessments we have so far:” followed by a numbered list of formative assessments chosen in Step 7.  Then state the following “Would you like an additional set of formative assessments to choose from, or shall we continue with these?”  If the user indicates they would like an additional set of formative assessments, repeat Step 7.  Also, if Step 7 is repeated, make sure not to discard or forget any formative assessments they have already chosen.  Otherwise, continue to Step 9.  
  
Step 9: For every assessment that has been chosen (both formative and summative), offer detailed, academic descriptions of the chosen assessments, including title, background, rationale, step-by-step process for facilitation, and assessment criteria.  For the assessment criteria section of each assessment, format these as tables. List each criterion as a separate row, with 5 levels of achievement as columns (0 to 5 points). And provide descriptions in the relevant cells of what would constitute the level of achievement for each criterion.  
  
Once you list all of these details regarding the assessments, state the following: “Please review these assessment details and let me know if you would like to make any changes.  If things look good, let me know and we can continue to the final step.”  If the user suggests any changes, do your best to apply these changes and then repeat Step 9.  Then move on to Step 10.  
  
Step 10:  Repeat the summary that was approved in Step 4.  Follow this with all of the approved assessment information from Step 9.  Follow this with a detailed course schedule formatted as shown below.  You must determine how to logically incorporate the formative assessments that the user indicated into the course schedule.  They should be distributed in such a way that students scaffold their understanding of the course topics from previous classwork in culmination of the summative assessment that should be listed in the final portion of the course.  
  
Course schedule format:  
“Course Schedule” (formatted as H1)  
“Week/Day 1: “\[Course focus for the week/day\] (formatted as H2)  
\[Two sentence description of what students can expect to cover and do in this week\]

1bcvd7p,1,2024-03-12,Can Someone Post the Right Answers to Engoo's tag for the Let's Go Quiz?,u/kaiser_ghidra,OnlineESLTeaching,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineESLTeaching/comments/1bcvd7p/can_someone_post_the_right_answers_to_engoos_tag/,"I've applied for this tutor's tag for four times now since last year and I've been teaching it on NC with my kid students. It's actually quite straightforward and fairly interactive to conduct with them and for some reason, Engoo puts some stringent barrier to teaching it with their poorly-made quiz which I'm sure has incorrect or misleading questions and answers. I even ran it through Google Gemini and it generated these answers:   


**Let's Go question 1: What tools can you use with “Let’s Go” lessons?**

* **Correct Answers:**
   * Hand/finger puppets
   * Flashcards
   * Toys
* **Incorrect Answer:**
   * Potentially harmful or dangerous objects

**Explanation:** Hand puppets, flashcards, and safe toys help make lessons more engaging and visual, especially for young learners. Dangerous objects are always a bad idea in a classroom setting.

**Let's Go question 2: How will the above tools help in the lesson?**

* **Correct Answers:**
   * Help the student visualize vocabulary and introduce characters
   * Entertain students
* **Incorrect Answers:**
   * Punish rowdy students

**Explanation:** Visual aids are key to teaching young children. They make learning more fun and help students associate words with images.  It's important to note that tools should never be used for punishment.

**Let's Go question 3: What's the best way to praise a student during a lesson?**

* **Correct Answers:**
   * Use emoticons and stickers in the chatbox
   * Praise them verbally and/or clap
   * Use puppets to mimic giving support
* **Incorrect Answer:**
   * Tell them they need to work harder and achieve perfection

**Explanation:** Positive reinforcement is essential for young learners. Perfectionism can cause anxiety and shouldn't be the focus.

**Let's Go question 4: How would you explain the word “car” to a student who doesn’t speak English well?**

* **Correct Answers:**
   * Using car sounds/honking or gesture turning the wheel
   * Drawing a car or showing them a toy
* **Incorrect Answers:**
   * Explaining it’s a vehicle that takes you from point A to point B
   * Telling them “it’s what your parent drives to work”

**Explanation:** Young learners need visual and auditory cues. Abstract definitions or examples they might not relate to won't help much.

**Let's Go question 5: How would you get answers from a student who struggles to respond?**

* **Correct Answer:** Ask questions that require short or Yes/No answers
* **Incorrect Answers:**
   * Tell them that they need to say at least something
   * Answer the question for them right away

**Explanation:** Break down questions into smaller, easier chunks for shy or struggling students. Don't put them on the spot or give away the answer too quickly.

**Let's Go question 6: How many times should you use the target language in the lesson?**

* **Correct Answer:** As many times as possible
* **Incorrect Answers:**
   * Twice
   * Whenever the student asks about it
   * Never

**Explanation:** Repetition is key for language learning, especially for young students.

**Let's Go question 7: What is the best way to correct a student?**

* **Correct Answer:** Correct them positively before asking them to repeat after you
* **Incorrect Answers:**
   * Asking them to repeat until they are able to say a word correctly
   * Ignore the mistake and continue with the lesson

**Explanation:** Directly correcting them in a positive way helps solidify the right pronunciation while maintaining their confidence. Ignoring mistakes won't help them learn.

**Let's Go question 8: How would you explain the verb “sing” to the student?**

* **Correct Answer:** By using gestures of holding the microphone and singing
* **Incorrect Answers:**
   * By using synonyms such as “chant” and “serenade”
   * By giving example sentences

**Explanation:** Young learners understand actions and visual cues better than complex vocabulary or abstract examples.

**Let's Go question 9: When teaching kids it’s important to pay attention to keeping the lesson upbeat, interesting, interactive, and overall positive.**

* **Answer:** True

**Let's Go question 10: It’s important to finish the lesson material regardless of the student’s learning speed.**

>**Answer:** False

Even got the AI-generated answer from TS stating I got less than their 9/10 marks to pass and wouldn't even let me know what I got wrong:   
 

>""You need to get 9 out of 10 questions correctly to pass. All questions that are in the test are taken from the Let's Go guide we have so it would be best to review the guide once more and re-take the test. Peruse it carefully and take your time with it as there is no rush in taking the test.""

# Introduction

Since the introduction of Project Work (PW) in Singapore's A-Level curriculum in the early 2000s, the subject has become a source of controversy for many students past and present, with many pointing out that the subject has failed to enable students to develop their creativity, team spirit or communication skills: 21CC Skills which MOE insists is being instilled in students. More often than not, students churn out projects based on safe topics that have been repeated time and time again, and the process of completing the subject generates rifts between team members and is usually a messy combination of different individuals' work being passed as the group's one. Just look at the complaints made by Redditors in the past on this subreddit:

* [Pw QnA rigged?!?!](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/17m5l9f/pw_qna_rigged/) (4 months ago)
* [F\*\*\* my dogs\*\*\* PW teammates](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/182k5g9/fuck_my_dogshit_pw_teammates/) (4 months ago)
* [Pw needs to be revised.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/wi45tl/pw_needs_to_be_revised/) (2 years ago)
* [\[A Levels\] \[Rant\] \[JC\] the pw system is screwed up I hate pw + is appealing worth it?](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/mrlk2k/a_levels_rant_jc_the_pw_system_is_screwed_up_i/) (3 years ago)

In fact, off the top of my head, I can already list a few issues regarding the current PW syllabus:

1. Hard-capped on word count prevents students from thoroughly exploring the topic of interest that they have selected, cheapens and simplifies their topic and discourages students from pursuing topics that are more complex which may require more explanation.
2. Vague and unclear assessment guidelines means that the assessment of the Written Report, Individual Report and Oral Presentation is highly subjective.
3. Difficulty of questions raised during the Q&A segment of the Oral Presentation varies.
4. Assessment of a student does not take into account their contributions (or lack thereof), allowing slackers to laze away the whole year, only needing to shine for 30 minutes on the day of the Oral Presentation.
5. Students are not prohibited to use ChatGPT or other AI tools, nor do they need to disclose it, for the written report, or the generation of images in the report.

Even alternative media channel RiceMedia.co has written an [article](https://www.ricemedia.co/project-work-university-admission-scores-good-riddance/) on the drawbacks of PW before. But I am not here to argue against the existence of PW, though its relevance remains highly questionable. More significantly, what I want to address is the many allegations students have made, claiming that the grading and assessment of PW is rigged and unfair. For instance, students have questioned how some schools are able to do so well for the subject, and some have asked how it is fair that 'slackers' in their group are able to achieve the same or better grade than them. After reading these claims by students, I naturally became curious about the extent of the accuracy. As a result of this, I began to initiate my own research behind this.  Throughout the past 1 year, I have sourced for data, engaged the Ministry of Education tirelessly to fact check the data, question them on my findings and to seek clarifications on their replies. Their slow replies, bureaucratic response and unconcerned attitude have ultimately led me to Reddit.

In this post, I will focus on three sections. First, I will explain why PW is unfair, and use genuine data to showcase that PW is indeed rigged. Secondly, I will detail the complete and utter incompetence of the Ministry of Education and SEAB in dealing with the issue that I presented to them, with their refusal to act on this issue amounting to gross negligence. Thirdly, I will highlight why this matter is so significant.

# Section 1: The Context, The Evidence and What it Means

Before I begin sharing the evidence that I have gathered, we must first take a look at why Project Work in itself is prone to unfair grading,

1. There is an incentive for schools to mark more leniently. If a school awards more 'A's for PW, they will also see a correlation with higher Rank Points (RP) among their students, as well as the number of students who achieve 90 RP. This then allows the school to perhaps gain popularity, attract more students, or even be viewed as 'better'. Or perhaps some schools might just want to see their students doing well.
2. In the same school but across different classes, different PW teachers themselves have different expectations, standards and way of marking. For example, in my personal experience, I have seen some PW teachers giving more drafts for their students' Written Report (WR) then others, allowing some groups to better amend their WR. I have also compared different classes' evaluation in their WR and found that for a similar evaluation, one group’s evaluation may be deemed as generic, while the other is deemed as excellent. Moreover, some schools are provided with question banks, while some have to come up with the questions themselves. This is but just some of the varying practices of different PW teachers.
3. While it is expected that PW be assessed by teachers that specialise in that subject, the PW Oral Presentation (OP) Segment can be Assessed by non-PW teachers, such as your Maths or Chemistry teacher, who do not have any specialisation in the subject. (yes, I am aware that there are teachers that specialise in PW, as well as other subjects) This not only questions whether there is a need for MOE to train teachers that specialise exclusively in PW, but it also raises the concern that the assessment by non-specialised teachers may vary widely from teacher to teacher.
4. It is of my suspicion, at least in my school, that nearly all students who are foreign student scholars (from nearby ASEAN countries) are given an 'A' grade. Before I elaborate on this part, I must add that I am friends with many foreign students and just like us, many of them are deserving of good grades for PW. In no way am I attempting to discriminate or pull down the contributions of these students. Nonetheless, this is highly erroneous because for the WR, the marks are awarded to all members equally and for the IR, the difference in marks is unlikely to make a big difference. As such, it lies only on the Oral Presentation (OP) component. Yet, this cannot be true, as it suggests that generally, Singaporean students cannot speak better English (whereby articulation is a component of the presentation) than their ASEAN counterparts, or even those from China, whose first language is not English to begin with. I would think that these scholars are given an 'A', to allow them to score better than the average student in the cohort, so as to either maintain the prestige of scholars or to showcase Singapore's ability to produce well-rounded students to and for their ASEAN neighbours.
5. Last but not least, there have been numerous allegations of unfair grading made by students on this subreddit. I shall not elaborate on them but I will list some:

* [Allegations of extreme varying distinction rates across classes in NJC](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/u949qg/comment/i5q3vgp/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)
* [Allegations of elitist grading between top schools and neighbourhood schools](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/jik212/comment/ga7mozd/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)
* Plentiful of other allegations can be seen in the Discussion Thread for PW Results Release in Assessment Year [2022](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/12ian4j/a_levels_8808_h1_project_work_results_release/), [2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/u1rnpb/a_levels_8808_h1_project_work_results_release/) and other years.

So, we now know that the PW system in itself is already prone to unfair grading, yet, if there is no proof of such unfair grading, then it cannot be said that such things are happening. Therefore, there is a need for us to prove, with evidence, whether the grading is fair or unfair. As such, the best method that I had thought of would be to refer to the distinction rates for PW achieved by each school every year for a few consecutive years. Luckily, Reddit has that data. Sourcing past discussion threads relating to the distinction rates achieved by each school every year for the past 4 consecutive years, I have compiled the data for selected schools between years 2019 to 2022 in the graph shown below. (I chose schools with a wide variety of cutoff points since I cannot fit so many schools in a graph)

&#x200B;

[PW Distinction Rates Across the Years Across Some Schools](https://preview.redd.it/8fxei2spx8oc1.png?width=1172&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc47f486846c3dbf90d8afe2987e502354a1c288)

As reflected by the graph, the most obvious trend is that the distinction rates remained unchanged every year regardless of the school. For instance, VJC remained at around 88% while ASRJC remained at around 38%. This graph alone raises 3 points on the basis of two issues, the linear trend within each school, and the wide range between schools:

**Point 1:** Such a linear trend cannot be replicated for other subjects. For instance, the distinction rates for Physics in my school varied widely in just two years. For the distinction rate to remain almost unchanged for four CONSECUTIVE years for ALL schools is nothing short of a coincidence. It does not take a genius for one to accept that this is proof of the unstandardised and unfair assessment of PW. It raises the question of whether a quota grading system is indeed in place, something which is denied by MOE/SEAB.

**Point 2:** The linear trend suggests that for each cohort that enrols into a school every year, the ability of the cohort to perform in PW is the same. It suggests that the creative, communication/presentation and writeup skills of every cohort is the same. This is in fact contradictory to the fact that the performance of cohorts in a school for other subjects varies widely as mentioned earlier. Again, this proves the unstandardised and unfair assessment of PW.

**Point 3:** PW is a non-content based subject. It is unlike other subjects like Mathematics or Chemistry, whereby 'better' schools usually perform better. Yet it seems that the data suggest otherwise. More prestigious schools like VJC and RI/HCI (which I did not include), scored well above 85% distinctions. Neighbourhood schools like ASRJC and TMJC score below 50%. For YIJC (not included), the score is just touching 20%. Nonetheless, if you are narrow-minded and argue the other way that those in more prestigious schools tend to have better creative and social skills (which I blatantly disagree with), then it does not explain why JPJC has an unusually high 70% distinction rate, well above other neighbourhood schools like ASRJC and TMJC.  Thus, this again proves the unstandardised and unfair assessment of PW.

In my view, the ideal graph would reflect a highly volatile non-linear trend for each school across the years, with the mean of the data across a few years being almost the same across all schools, with 'better' schools fairing slightly better for the mean.

With this, we have established that PW is indeed marked unfairly.

More than that, it also proves another point, which is that PW is also unmerited.

Firstly, based on the statistics, a student who does the exact same work and puts in the exact same effort for PW and gets a 'B' would have likely obtained an 'A' in another school in a parallel universe.

Secondly, PW is highly up to personal interpretation, and does not reward hard or smart work, but rather lies entirely on luck. This goes against the foundations of meritocracy that Singapore strives to achieve.

Third, it is unfortunate that in one of the most important examinations in Singapore, luck still plays a big role in determining one's results rather than pure merit. It is also unfortunate that by releasing the results months ahead of the A Levels, the thought of never being able to reach your fullest potential due to pure luck discourages and demotivates students to do better for their A Levels, especially if they have already been doing well consistently.

# Section 2: MOE and SEAB's Responses

With all these findings, I made the decision to contact MOE/SEAB. Throughout this entire section, you will begin to see the sheer ineffectiveness of MOE/SEAB, their incompetence, and most importantly, their inability to respond quickly or thoroughly (keep in mind that they pledge to respond within **3 working days**).

I first contacted SEAB on 14 April 2023 via email and received a reply back after **2 weeks**, with a template answer insisting that, and I quote:  ""If it is found that a school’s assessment (for PW) is too lenient or too strict, the marks will be moderated to bring the assessment back into line with the national standard."" Naturally, I was dissatisfied with the answer because in no way could they explain why the evidence I gathered was wrong, nor could they provide evidence to show that they were right. So, I proceeded to email them again for elaboration and after **3 weeks**, they simply stated to “seek advice and guidance from your school”. At this point, I vehemently responded that the issue is a systemic, nationwide issue and not something one school can solve on their own. After **3 weeks,** after reminding them to respond back, they asked for my name and school, perhaps in a bid to get the school to approach me and shut me up. Nonetheless, I refused to give up such information, because I told them that this issue has affected tens of thousands of students every year for the past two decades, and that I would not accept it if the issue was resolved for me, and not for the many others out there. After **2 weeks,** they literally repeated the same template answer from the beginning, stating that the marks are moderated across schools, and then had the audacity to add in: “Over the years, our students have done well in PW”. well no sh\*\*, literally everyone gets an A or B, no doubt its the best performing A Level subject but the issue is obviously about getting an A or B, not between A/B or an S (facepalm). Okay, I apologise for the informality there, but that literally made me fume. After that, it was **months** of sending emails to MOE/SEAB for elaboration and evidence, waiting weeks for a reply, only to get a one to two-liner reply.

After many futile exchanges, I finally received a reply that MOE/SEAB would escalate the matter to the relevant department and finally begin investigating the issue.  After **4 weeks**, I would have hoped to receive a well elaborated answer. Instead, I received a single line reply restating that PW is moderated fairly. At that point, I was completely sure that no investigation had been done and the email was sitting there for 4 weeks, waiting for some MOE intern to push out one of their template answers. They told me that they would close the case despite being unable to prove my data wrong, nor prove why they were right. Eventually, I gave them further allegations made by students on Reddit over the years and pressed them to assign an officer in the relevant department for follow up. All my emails were ignored or simply brushed away. In late October, **6 months** after my first email, I finally decided to call MOE as I eventually realised that a call would allow the situation to be resolved quickly. After an **hour-long call**, the MOE Support Officer promised to escalate the matter to a relevant MOE officer, for the officer to get back to me via a call. The officer told me that I had to wait up to **21 working days** for a call. So I waited. And after **1 month**, no call was made. By this time, December had arrived. As such, I emailed them once again and this time, I clearly asked for MOE to set a date and time for a call. MOE promised to follow up and after **1 month**, I received back one final reply in the form of an email. In this reply, they did not schedule a call, but rather repeated once again, the template answer, word for word, and stated that the case was closed.

In summary, in 12 months,

* MOE could not account for or explain the statistics reflected in the graph.
* MOE could not provide any evidence, despite insisting that the grading for PW is fair and merited.
* MOE could not explain the allegations made by other students on Reddit.
* MOE could not reply back within the promised 3 working days, lest within a reasonable 7 working days.
* MOE could take months to formulate a single line response or a copy and paste template answer.

# Section 3: Why is this Issue of Significant Importance?

1. Unmeritocratic

As mentioned earlier, the unfair and unstandardised assessment of PW makes the grades unmerited. As a country that prides itself as a meritocratic society, the fact that the work you put in plays such a small role compared to the school or PW tutor you have is a tragedy. It is even more unfortunate that this takes place in the A-Levels, which is perhaps one of the most important examinations a student might take in their lives.

2. Unjustified Disadvantage for Scholarships and Potentially Courses

For instance, the NUS Merit Scholarship or NTU Nanyang Scholarship is automatically provided to students who are enrolled into non-interview courses who have scored 90 Rank Points. If a student does similarly well, but scores a ‘B’ for PW, they will only have 88.75 Rank Points. This does not guarantee the student the scholarship despite actually performing as well, and an interview/good portfolio is needed to secure the scholarship. Similarly, the Renaissance Engineering Programme in NTU guarantees an interview to any student that secures 90RP and puts it as the first choice. There are many good and prestigious scholarships that one can be eliminated from just for scoring 88.75RP, and not 90RP.

This can also possibly be extended to courses as well, where a student’s rank points barely misses the cut off point due to PW, preventing them from pursuing that course, despite actually performing as well as others who have just met the cut off points.

3. Unjust Reflection of Ability

Student 1 who pursues 4H2 with all ‘A’s with a ‘B’ in PW secures 88.75RP. Student 2 who pursues 4H2 with one ‘B’ and an ‘A’ in PW secures 88.75RP too. On paper, this suggests that both students performed equally well in the A-Levels. However, notwithstanding that the 4th H2 is regarded as a H1 in calculation, this suggests that a content-based subject like Chemistry taken at the H2 Level is as demanding as a non-content based subject (PW) taken at the H1 Level.

[Unjust Reflection of Ability](https://preview.redd.it/is6yq1jxz8oc1.png?width=653&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c267bb5f95b54a1085fee597f3c3cc8b99cb8c9)

4. Unjustified Disadvantage for Students Applying to Universities Under the New 70RP System in 2026

This will not affect most people here since you will likely be applying before the first cohort of students under the 70RP system applies for university. Nonetheless, this can affect a small minority of students who choose to apply in 2026. Under the new system, the 4th content based subject and PW will be excluded from the Rank Point Calculation. This means that for students who have taken the A-Levels before the new system, your rank points will be rebased (your RP/90 x 70), instead of just removing PW and the 4th subject from your score. However, this is unfair for these students.

For instance, a student Alpha who pursues 4H2 under the old system with all ‘A’s with a ‘B’ in PW secures 88.75RP. After rebasing, the score is now 69RP. A student Beta who pursues 4H2 OR 3H2,1H1 under the new system with the three main H2 scoring ‘A’s with a Pass in PW secures 70RP. This suggest that student Alpha performed worse than student Beta, without considering the fact that a ‘B’ in PW is a Pass in PW and that student Alpha had to spend more effort ensuring that his 4th H2 performs well, something which student Beta may choose to ignore since it is not included in the calculation.

&#x200B;

5. Unnecessary

All overseas universities do not even consider Project Work when one applies. Only local universities do so. It not only shows the disregard our overseas partners have towards the subject, but it also shows that students applying into local universities are assessed in part by a subject that holds no weight or meaning to a person’s academic or non-academic abilities.

# Conclusion

I recognise and understand that for a large majority of you, including those who are currently taking the A-Levels this year or are applying for university this year, this matter does not concern you. It may be because you have benefitted from this system, or it may be because you are not really disadvantaged despite being a victim to this injustice, or it may be because you simply don’t have any stake in this matter anymore. Nonetheless, I ask that all of you at least recognise the issue at hand.

Other than that, there is nothing more that we can do. Honestly, petitions, spamming, etc. will do no purpose but only amplify our voices in an echo chamber.

I know and have accepted that this issue will never be resolved. I know now that this act of injustice will be brushed off by clueless, bureaucratic and incompetent high ranking civil servants in MOE. The very same people who never had to take PW when they were students, yet somehow think that they know more about this than us students who have worked tirelessly for one entire year on this farce of a subject.

My message to the MOE officers, especially the seniors, in charge of implementing PW is this: You have completely and utterly failed in achieving your vision of Moulding the Next Generation. PW has not instilled any skills in any student who has taken your subject in the past two decades, other than a common hatred for graded group projects. I hope you enjoyed reaching your KPI for rolling this half-baked programme out, and earning that sweet money which is not even representative of the ethos of the public service. My suggestion? You should try rolling out PW across your department too, and instead of putting grades on the line, you should put your bonus. It should be easy, since you are all masters in group projects anyway

&#x200B;

Still, I rejoice in the idea that this miscarriage will soon end. As many of you know, in the 2023 Committee of Supply Debate in Parliament, MOE had announced that the Project Work syllabus has become a Pass/Fail subject. With the majority of students scoring an A or B each year, a Pass (A to E) is more than guaranteed. More significantly, a pass in PW is needed to enter local universities. No school will ever fail their students for that would mean that their students would have no need to pursue their studies in J2 as they cannot even enter university no matter how great their A Levels. MOE themselves would also not allow schools to fail their students, as they have [spent over $250,000 on every Singaporean child](https://www.moe.gov.sg/news/speeches/20240301-transcript-of-minister-for-education-chan-chun-sings-speech-for-the-ministry-of-educations-response-to-the-committee-of-supply-2024-debates). In fact, I half suspect that the transition to this new system is partly due to the fact that MOE recognises the complaints that have been made by students over the years regarding the unfair grading of PW. Nonetheless, when I approached MOE about this, they neither confirmed nor denied this but stated that this move is simply to allow students to pursue any topic they want, free from the stress of grades.

Despite this, we still have braindead students who think that this change is not just unnecessary but plain wrong. Just read this rubbish [Straits Times Forum Letter](https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/forum/forum-with-less-focus-on-project-work-students-may-lose-some-workplace-skills) published by a student after the change was announced titled: *With less focus on project work, students may lose some workplace skills.* Moreover, the new syllabus doesn’t change the fact that PW will never be successful in instilling 21st CC skills in students.

But I know that for now, there are groups of people who might suffer. Namely, I want to address two groups of people:

1. To those receiving your PW results in 2024 in April, some of you will be graded unfairly. But I say to these people to ignore your grades. Naturally, you will feel all sorts of emotions - grief, anger and sadness. Some of your group mates might have undeservedly received a better grade. You might see your classmates cheering away while you fumble in the background knowing that you can never achieve a perfect score, if that’s what you desire. But you have to put your foot in the game and just push on for you have something greater to work towards.
2. To those who have been rejected for scholarships simply because they got a few points less, I can’t say much, but I implore you to try other scholarships if possible, and I trust that there will be scholarship providers out there that can see beyond PW, and beyond your grades, and look at your inward self and your character as well as your desire for the scholarship.

And this is really all I have to say about this topic that's been living rent-free in my mind for the past 1 year. It does give me some sense of relief that I, at the very least, wrote this out. If you’ve read all the way till the end, thank you.

# TL;DR: (thank you ChatGPT)

Since its introduction, Project Work (PW) has faced criticism for failing to develop skills like creativity and teamwork. Allegations of unfair grading abound, with evidence suggesting systematic issues. Despite my efforts to engage the Ministry of Education (MOE) over the past 1 year, responses have been inadequate, highlighting bureaucratic inefficiency. Unfair PW grading affects scholarship eligibility, university admissions, and perpetuates systemic inequalities in the rank point calculation. While recent changes to PW have mitigated issues, it does not mean that past injustices have been solved. Nonetheless, I simply ask you to acknowledge this issue and share it if you can, for I have already accepted that it will always remain unsolved, and that's okay."
1beoazm,1,2024-03-14,Learn Coding while building your dream idea (and pay for the lessons).,u/ekim2077,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1beoazm/learn_coding_while_building_your_dream_idea_and/,"Hello,

I'm a coder myself and had this idea, I recently stopped working as an outsourcing shop because 2 of my SaaS projects have been returning enough income to live by for the past 2 years. At the height my company hand 7 people working including me, all coders. Everyone started from a QA position and I taught them coding (mostly direct them to the source where they could read and learn about the issue). But unlike traditional linear learning, the lessons were always a small part of the projects we were doing for clients. 

So I actually liked the teaching stuff the most in the 6–7 years this lasted. Now with the last employee leaving soon I want to create this class concept where my students would actually be people who have an idea that they want to make and sell and be willing to learn how to code it.

I would be teaching coding and also prompting, as GPT4 and Claude as well as many smaller LLMs can do a lot of the grunt work when prompted correctly. This is actually something that now can cut the time to code by 50-75% as long as it's not some fancy algorithm the LLMs haven't seen before.

The ideal ""Entrepreneur Student"" would be the ones that have an idea that doesn't need to be finished yesterday, it would take 6–12 months probably to get to MVP level for their project. I would write code the needed code if a project got  stuck so it can progress (although hard to learn this way). We would probably work on a comprehensive PRD at first, where I would estimate time to completion. And the stack needed for that project.

The biggest challenge is; I could only take 4-5 students for something like this, as anymore would be hard to manage. And realistically the monthly fee would have to be $1000 or more. Also, a student would have to be ready to give a lot of effort and spend at least 6 months. 

At the end, they would be able to market their product and also add features with the help of LLM's or move forward with the knowledge needed to manage coders. Also, they would have a good idea of what features will take how long to add. As an added bonus, this whole thing would probably end up costing the same as outsourcing it.

What do you think of this idea?"
1bf3220,2,2024-03-14,Making my custom GPT work with more accuracy,u/meltingkeith,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1bf3220/making_my_custom_gpt_work_with_more_accuracy/,"Hey all - I'm a secondary school teacher currently using chatGPT to help me make graphing worksheets for students. Currently, I'm getting it to create a dataset based on a pre-determined ""level"", then put that dataset into a latex template that I can copy into a compiler to make worksheets. The problem I'm having is that as I add more complexity, GPT makes way more mistakes. I worked out most of the kinks for the lower levels, but for the higher levels I've asked it to increment the x-variable by different amounts and it often forgets. It can do it well when reminded, but the more I add, the less it can do.  


The problem is, I currently have 4 levels, and I'm thinking of moving to 6 (picture levels as ""1A, 1B, 1C, 2A, 2B, 2C"" where each number corresponds to a numerical difficulty, and the letter refers to a type of graph difficulty). Previously, I could generate up to 3 datasets at a time no problem, but starting from level 3 I can only generate two and no matter how many I make, I always need to ask it to make fixes (there's no point asking for 1, because it's a coin flip on whether or not it will need fixes anyway).  


Any suggestions to try and add some more consistency and accuracy to my outputs?"

1bffrdk,23,2024-03-15,Does anyone actually believe in asynchronous online courses? Especially now with AI?,u/Anonphilosophia,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1bffrdk/does_anyone_actually_believe_in_asynchronous/,"**TLDR - Asynchonous courses do NOT qualify as education.  They are basically 70's style correspondence courses (online before internet - where you mailed in your assignments for a degree) utilizing technology.**    
**Now, with ChatGPT, asynchonous online is complete and utter bullshit.**  
**Academia has truly, rightfully and justifiably earned its decline in enrollments by allowing this shit to become ""education.""**

As a philosophy prof (adjunct), I NEVER believed in them.

I started college as a Poli Sci major - to go to law school.  I had to take two required Philosophy courses as my school was Catholic, and I was DREADING THEM. Most of my friends were science majors, and that curriculum had them earlier than mine and they told me Philosophy was AWFUL (I think they disliked the fact that there were no ""exact"" answers - no offense, STEM people.)

I LOVED PHIL.  It was almost like ""coming out.""  O.M.G.  To read so many different beliefs over the same ideas (ethics, knowledge, reality, god, etc.).  To know that no one was actually RIGHT (but some were dead wrong) was SO FREEING.

It was everything I'd hoped poli sci would be - heated debated and discussions about abstract ideas (there were no ""heated debates"" in our version of poli sci - just theories and memorization.)    
**I, a die-hard introvert, became one of those students who had to be told, ""OK - let others speak.""**  My ex and I (also poli sci - also changed to Phil) would literally get in shouting matches in class.

I changed my major after three courses, still with the intent to go to law school.  Then I realized, I wanted to give the freedom of philosophy to others (and I do - when I teach LIVE classes) and decided to go to graduate school to teach full time (and I don't - I choose corporate and teach on the side.) 

I entered a PhD program, dropped out after 3 years with no degree.  I didn't care about reasearch.  I  just wanted to teach 101 to people who don't even know what philosophy is and watch their heads explode like mine did.

I was working full time and realized I missed teaching and was able to get adjunct gig at a CC (I had more credits than required for an MA, but no degree).  Funny, when they hired me I signed all of the paperwork without knowing the salary.  When I finally asked HR at the end of the process, she said, ""HONEY!!! That should always be the FIRST question you ask.""  I replied, ""I missed teaching, I would have done it for free.""  I was doing it for my love of philosophy, not the money.  I had money from my other job.

I taught after work and on Sunday afternoons.  WHEN I TELL YOU THAT SUNDAY IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST TIME TO TEACH PHILOSOPHY!!!!   The students weren't tired from working, they were awake and aware and, after a few weeks, ready to fight! (and sometimes - when they realized their beliefs were not valid - admit defeat. My favorite was when a student wrote on a paper, ""I know now that it doesn't make any sense, but I'm going to believe it anyway."" LOL.)    
I love watching them think - you can literally SEE them trying to fit their beliefs into what they just learned. Both times were good, but that SUNDAY CLASS.... I could recreate the same classroom dynamic that caused me to change my major!

As they started offering online courses, my course enrollments dropped.  Then one semester, my Sunday class didn't make.  I knew it was the beginning of the end.  **But I vowed, I WOULD NEVER TEACH PHILOSOPHY ONLINE as that was against my ""teaching religion"" based on EXPERIENCE.**

Because here's the deal - I actually went back to school to earn my masters.  I needed the letters to move up in my career.  And **I took an asyncrhonous online course.**  My degree program was ""philosophy adjacent"" meaning I went in ready to continue the heated debates and discussions we had during my undergrad and first attempt at grad.  But when I took that online course, this is what I learned.

**It does not matter that you care about the subject, if the teacher says that you need to ""post once and respond twice"" then just do that, and don't put to much thought into your responses**, because

* NO ONE is going to read your response (if they met the quota)
* NO ONE is going to respond to your response (if they met the quota)
* NO ONE is going to respond thoughtfully to your post - When you post, no matter how good it is, at best you get bullshit responses from your classmates (""I agree with you.""  ""That's a good point"" etc - responses that I do NOT allow in my online courses.)

My instructors LOVED my posts and papers (note, my first school was MUCH more intense.  I could tell by the comments that they were so happy to see this level of work.  **And I get it - it's like seeing an actual written work after grading three discussions of ChatGPT - that level of appreciation, y'all know what I mean...**)

**So I basically knew asynchronous online was NOT what education was supposed to be - at least not for Philosophy/Philosophy-Adjacent courses - and continued my vow to NEVER DO IT.**

Eventually, I had to stop teaching due to work travel and the fact that my classes kept not making as the online was increasing.  I couldn't commit to in-person, but I still REFUSED to do asynchronous online.  

But then came the pandemic.  My company took a hit (it's back now) and I decided why not try... I could use the cash, I knew I would dislike it.  For the first time, I was teaching for the money, not the love of the subject.

I WAS CORRECT, I did dislike  I went from engaged students (and yeah, it starts as ""engagement by force"" since you have to come to class - but even the most ""determined to be bored"" student had that one topic that brought them in) to students who did the bare minimum.  I didn't want to read discussion post (that ONLY met the requirements, never more) I wanted to discuss, debate, WATCH THEM LEARN.

**And when I started, I'd only heard of ChatGPT - but didn't use it (Why would I?  If there is one thing studying philosophy taught me, it is HOW TO FUCKING READ, WRITE, and THINK CRITICALLY.  I don't fucking need ChatGPT.  And these students wouldn't either if they were actually fucking LEARNING.)**

But one day I started noticing that the level of discussion responses and test answers were NOT in alignment.  How are you writing like you read MORE than the assigned readings but getting all of the questions on that topic incorrect?  Someone told me to check outChatGPT.  OMG. THERE IT IS!!!!!  

That dislike of AO turned into a **WHITE HOT HATRED**.  I hate asynchronous online more than I have ever hated anything.  It is absolutely NOT what philosophy is supposed to be.  **IT IS NOT WHAT EDUCATION IS SUPPOSED TO BE.**  I do not believe it has ANY educational value whatsoever.  The only person gaining in this is OPENAI - for the number of users it is getting.

To the powers that be, those who endorse it because it increases enrollments (and dropoputs - but who cares about that????), those who write research articles trying to give it validity (and probably earn tenure/meet research requirements - because you cannot POSSIBLY believe what you are writing), I want to say a loud FUCK YOU.  You are doing far more damage to academia than you could ever imagine.  And if academic keeps believing this bullshit - it has truly earned its decline.

I actually hire recent undergrads.  I don't work in academia; I work outside the bubble.  And some of these children are LACKING.  I know there are many things that are leading to the decline of critical thinking - social media, thought-bubbles, overprotective parents, blah blah blah.  But if you think that asychronous online is doing anything but ADDING to the decline - you are deluding yourself.

**I hope the full-time faculty get together soon and start a revolution.**  Because AO needs to be abolished immediatly.  Zoom/Remote is fine, but asychronous online is COMPLETE AND UTTER BULLSHIT.

I gave the students a very simple take-home exam, just to help reinforce some of the important details of the course students tend to forget.

Of the 23 who've submitted so far (still a chance of late submission), 9 of them clearly plagiarized or used AI to complete the exam. These were questions that could have been answered by spending just a couple of hours with the textbook, or even looking up the answers online and finding the relevant sections of the textbook - which is all primary sources - to quote.

I suspect a few more of similar cheating, but can't prove it. If they did cheat, they're smarter than the majority of the others, who at best simply put ChatGPT output into a text spinner and submitted it as their own work. Some didn't even try that hard.

Just a completely pointless bloodbath, but the only guilt I feel is that the ones who got away with it likely have higher grades than the ones who made an honest effort, simply because they covered all the bases of the questions."

I'm seeking some advice and ideas for an upcoming class workshop I'll be leading on the topic of AI in education, particularly focusing on the limitations of Language Model-based Learning (LLMs) such as ChatGPT. 

My goal is to engage students in comparative pedagogy by demonstrating the challenges and drawbacks associated with relying solely on LLMs for educational purposes. For my workshop, I'm planning to design a short activity where students prompt ChatGPT to analyze a research paper, to showcase its limitations and biases.

I'm looking for suggestions on **what prompts students should use when engaging with ChatGPT to analyze the research paper**. These prompts should aim to highlight the challenges LLMs face in understanding nuanced academic texts and discussing the sources of their information.

Additionally, I'm interested in ideas on **how to demonstrate the biases inherent in LLMs, especially in educational contexts.** This could involve exploring how LLMs might misinterpret or misrepresent certain concepts within the research paper.

Since this activity is meant to be a part of a larger class session, it should be concise and not take longer than **30 minutes.** Therefore, any suggestions or ideas should be feasible within this time frame.

Hope this makes sense, any input would be super appreciated <3"

It is higher diploma(conversion course), so most doing it are mature students/working professionals.

Since the start I have noticed how reliant everyone is on chatGPT, myself included. That said I am highly motivated, so use it as a learning tool, more to verify my work than actually do it for me. In my experience, the others in my cohort are using it for everything.

This week we had to submit an assignment, which was basically writing a server backup script in bash/batch. I spent the last three weeks learning the fundamentals of bash and now feel I have learned a valuable skill. The others who I spoke with used chatGPT and completed the assignment in less than a few hours. I have viewed their code and you really cant tell.

I feel we are in an intermediary stage, where the education system has not adapted, and people can use these ai tools to cheat their way through assignments. We are hard wired to take the path of least resistance. I did not take education seriously in the past and want to avoid that trap this time, but I feel this will be detrimental to young people just starting third level education.

1bgyjnp,1,2024-03-17,AITAH for telling my sister she deserved to be expelled?,u/ufgif4389,AITAH,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1bgyjnp/aitah_for_telling_my_sister_she_deserved_to_be/,"I (13M) have a twin sister Millie (13F). Millie (13F) and her friends Zoe (13F) and Everleigh (14F) got expelled from school last week.  
  
Here’s what happened: There’s this boy in our grade, Ryder (13M). Ryder is very popular and a lot of the girls like him, I’m gay and also had a crush on him and so did a few of my friends. Ryder is a very nice kid, him and his friends/baseball teammates aren’t super close to me, but they’ve always been nice to me and even have stood up for me back in elementary school when I was bullied for being gay. We go to a Republican school but they don’t care and are still nice to everyone, like this trans boy in our grade.  
  
Ryder would always say he wasn’t looking to date when anyone asked him out, wether it was a girl or a guy, both me and Millie flirted with him at different times.   
  
At the beginning of this school year, things changed though, we had a girl named Charlotte transfer from another school, she’s a nice girl and I have her in a few of my classes. Charlotte is autistic and she is very into fashion, and will wear outfits from around the world but in a respectful way, she’s also really talented at makeup and I know many of my friends who are jealous of her skills as I am as well bc I wear makeup sometimes.  
  
Ryder started to flirt with Charlotte on her first day, I remember I was in English and we had to choose a partner to do a little interview with and we would share with the class, like an icebreaker type of activity. Ryder asked Charlotte to be his partner. A few weeks later he asked her out and she said yes. They have been dating ever since then and I’m happy for them. The issue is many of the kids in my school aren’t, including Millie, Zoe and Everleigh.   
  
Some kids have sent Charlotte mean DMs on Insta or called her names in school, Ryder and his friends always get these kids in trouble and we have a teacher who is autistic who also helps Charlotte, he’s one of my teachers and is super chill.  
  
A few months ago, Millie and her friends started to also bully Charlotte, they would make fun of the way she dressed or how she doesn’t like bright lights and it was just really mean, they got in trouble, like getting detention and getting suspended but they didn’t care.  
  
About 5 or 6 weeks ago is when things got really bad, Millie and her friends started saying inappropriate things about Ryder’s body to his face, they also did the same to his friends. They got suspended for a week and were told if they got in trouble again, they could be expelled. A few days after they got back, Millie, Zoe and Everleigh were all expelled for sexual harassment for comments and assault, as Millie tried to kiss him despite him saying no. They made some pretty gross comments to him and it was definitely sexual harassment and assault due to the kiss thing.  
  
We go to a private school so next year, Millie and her friends will go to the public high school near us as we will be in 9th grade after summer break. I will be going to a private high school that all my friends will be going to.   
  
I was talking to Millie on Thursday night and she was asking me how Ryder was doing, I told her to stop being creepy and she said she did nothing wrong because “boys can’t get harassed” and Ryder should “man up” when I asked my parents about this, they said she was right to have her opinion, even if they disagreed. She was still going on to me about how Ryder needed to “man up” so I told her to shut up and told her she deserved to be expelled and that I had no empathy for her.   
  
She got upset and said I was a bad brother and said I should stick with her bc she’s my twin. I love her but I think what she did was wrong, she’s brought up times she stuck with me when I got in trouble, like when I got detention for using ChatGPT on one of my homework’s earlier this year or when I got a 0 for cheating on a test this year. I’ll admit I’m not a great student and my average is only a 77, which is lower than what her’s was. Ryder actually offered to tutor me a few weeks before the sexual harassment stuff started to happen but I told him I didn’t need the help.   
  
I talked to Ryder at school on Friday about what happened and he told me we were still chill and he would still tutor me if I wanted him to, which I told him I’d think about.   
  
One of Millie’s friends who saw me talking to him took a photo of us talking and sent it to her and Millie started texting me saying how I was betraying her and how if I didn’t stop, that I would ruin our relationship. I’m wondering if I went too far, I asked my friends and they told me I was good but a lot of them are friends with Ryder and have crushes on him and his friends. AITAH?"
1bgyrn1,1,2024-03-17,"We need to be teaching students how to use AI, not only bashing on it.",u/revere2323,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1bgyrn1/we_need_to_be_teaching_students_how_to_use_ai_not/,"There is so much bashing of AI and ChatGPT on this sub. There’s a lot of comments how AI is useless and stupid—someone even wrote that it has not use at all. I can not tell you enough that you are sounding like the old dinosaurs who wouldn’t use the internet and thought it was worthless. And now they can’t add an attachment to an email or make a pdf.

ChatGPT is an incredible digital editor. It is very useful when you have written a paragraph and done all the research, but you’re having issues getting it to flow, it’s too wordy, could be more concise, or has “loopy logic” (the paragraph seems cyclical). Just give the paragraph to ChatGPT, tell it to make it more concise or clear, and/or more instructions (change only what you have to, keep the same tone, use academic language). It will spit out something that then itself can be edited and tweaked through 2 ways, 1) reprompting, and more importantly, 2) editing it yourself. It’s an incredible time saver and can help get you past writers block. In this way it’s also not plagiarism; it is the same as using a friend to read and help edit.

ChatGPT is incredible at producing code. If you work in statistics or anything that requires code, ChatGPT can double, triple + your output. Yes you need to make sure the code works and gives you what you need. But you need to do that anyway with code you yourself write. If the code ChatGPT gives you results in an error, just give the error to ChatGPT and it will correct. You may need to do this a few times, but 9/10 it will get there. But we need to teach students HOW to use it. Like giving ChatGPT the appropriate inputs needed (variable names, how to explain properly the procedure that needs to be done).

ChatGPT is great at brainstorming and organizing thoughts. It can make outlines, help to clarify thoughts one might have, and just give starting off points. ChatGPT is like Wikipedia. You can’t trust what it says completely, but most of the time it’s right, and it allows you to go out and better find that info.

ChatGPT is great at making (non scientific) figures in presentations. Like when you want a little funny photo of something specific (a scientist who is also a cowboy studying bugs). It can not make scientific figures obviously, but it has uses!

ChatGPT is useful! It needs to be taught. Let’s not be dinosaurs. It is the future."

Basically I used ChatGPT to check code that I wrote during both of the midterms and final exam. We have to trace our code in a text box without running it and I used AI to verify if what I was doing would work. This is the first time I have ever taken exams in school (weird, I know) and with the strict time limits I couldn't handle the anxiety and caved.

It was really only until the end of the quarter that I took the time to reflect on what I had done and I realized the gravity of my behavior. I really want to be a good student, and I felt like learning to cope with the anxiety was something I really needed to do for myself. I wanted to make things right so I sent an email to my professor pretty much fessing up to everything I have described.

I have no idea what's going to happen to be honest. Am I going to be able to attend classes next quarter? How will this affect my future academic prospects?

Commenting that only students and staff have access to bright space, and seeing all the other posts and comments with screenshots of discussion posts... why do we delete mine?

I have cleared the screenshot of anything even possible of tying it back to a particular class or person... unless you are the person who wrote it, the teacher, or in the class - in which case you can see it anyway... so, this screenshot is attached again, without any sort of way of attaching it to a class or student or person - unless you are in the class also and have already seen it or have it... for the rest of you, this screenshot is not personally identifiable... so hopefully that satisfies the few humorless folks on here who had my original post deleted...

The whole point of the post was to bring some attention to the fact that, while yes, ChatGPT is a big issue, I am not sure how people that can post things like this and still pass at the collegiate level are much different.

## Introduction

***Name:*** *Asksia ,* ***Website:*** [*www.asksia.ai*](http://www.asksia.ai) *,* ***Category:*** *Education + AI*

Student can ask any academic question and Asksia will instantly provide step-by-step answers. We have the functionality combining Chegg and ChatGPT, but we’re more AI than Chegg and more academic focused than ChatGPT. 

## Product Feature (1): Asksia vs ChatGPTs

OpenAI's current strongest product is GPTs, which is based on OpenAI's most advanced model, GPT-4, and equipped with a unified tool interface, program coding, DALLE·3, and internet capabilities. Even so, as a general-purpose product, it has many shortcomings in the service experience in educational scenarios.

Asksia focuses on excelling in educational scenarios, centering on students' many learning pain points, needs, and habits to optimize product functionality. It integrates many details with GPT-4, allowing every student to experience high-quality learning on the Asksia platform.

## 1. Detailed steps showcase

Even the most advanced GPTs products can not explain each small question in detail, step by step; they tend to become lazy with subsequent questions.

In contrast, we at Asksia have a reasonable approach to ensure that every small question receives a detailed explanation. Research has also found that when models are able to break down their thought processes in detail, step by step, the accuracy tends to be higher.

## 3. Precise and automatic video link

Asksia is capable of automatically linking to appropriate explanatory videos and verifying their availability, ensuring that learners are provided with the explanatory videos they need the most.

Although openai launched GPTs, its threshold is low, a large number of user-created agents can not handle more precise problems. Even if the **@ function** is used to link multiple agents, it still cannot provide appropriate external links according to the problem to enhance the learning experience.

This is mostly because I think new developers don't want to hear certain truths and more senior devs are too tired or don't care enough to tell you how it is. Here is my list of things new devs don't want to hear but you should if you want to go anywhere in this field.

- Leetcode sucks, it's an archaic way of testing someone's abilities, it won't be a useful skill on your day to day job and you should learn it anyways. Stop complaining about leetcode, it may not be a useful skill for when you actually get a job but if you're good at it, it will make your job search drastically easier. All complaining does is waste your time that could be spent grinding out more leetcode questions. In fact by the time you finish this sentence, you could have used merge sort ten times over to solve a leetcode question instead of your basic ass bubble sort that is not even halfway through your array

- ChatGPT is an amazing tool that can help you code, it's a great tool for learning, you will probably use it a lot once you get a job and you should stop using it if you are in school. Learning through ChatGPT while in school is like telling a student to read the textbook for help with an assignment but the answers are also in the back of the book. Sure you can use the textbook and read it to help you learn the material but most of you will just jump to the back of the book and get the answers. This will not help you learn and if you get in trouble that's on you. Remember all that code that is being generated is out there somewhere in some repo. Tools can find those obscure codes and call you out for cheating. If you are new, I would stay away. It will make you a weaker developer if you rely on AI. Or maybe this whole post was written by AI, you'll never know.

- Projects are a great, there are plenty of tutorials online on all sorts of projects you can build, this includes step by step instructions on getting huge projects built and you should ignore all of them. The amount of people applying to jobs nowadays with their React websites that are essentially copy and pasted from some tutorial on Youtube or a weather app or a calculator, this won't make you stand out. Projects are supposed to display your ability to go deep into a topic and show you are capable of building software on your own not your ability to follow a tutorial. The best projects are those that only you can come up with. Not because others can't build them but because only you would want to. And before you ask, no an AI waifu is not a good project.

- Being passionate about computer science is absolutely a great reason to pursue this career and so is doing it for the money. One of my biggest pet peeves in this subreddit is the amount of people that think that the only reason to pursue CS is for passion. The truth is that money is a huge deal to a lot of people. The world is harsh and not all of us can do the thing we are passionate about. Joining this field for money is okay and following the path with the biggest check is absolutely okay. Whatever reason you chose to do this for, it's a valid reason and we should stop gatekeeping our field. Unless you code in Java.

- Coding is a huge part of what this field is about but so is reading documentation, debugging and lots of staring a blank screen wondering why you do this. Many new developers picture themselves solving problems and typing cool code into their computers but the reality of the job is much different. For many of us our daily jobs only requires a handful of lines of code, and mostly it's just debugging, planning, reading other people's code and meetings. Trust me I am writing this at work because anything is better than having to look through pages of poorly documented code in order to center a div.

- Lastly, the more you code the better you will get, eventually after years of doing it over and over again you will go from being bad at it to maybe being okay. The truth is that most developers are not geniuses. Not everyone can be Sam Altman or John Carmack. Most of you will never be good enough to be great at coding. Despite what anyone has told you, coding is hard. The better you get at it, the more you'll realize how bad you are at it. While this may sound discouraging, It really isn't. The way i look at it is that anytime I think I am stupid for not knowing something, it's always reassuring that most people in my field probably don't know it either. Now how do you exit VIM again?"

{long boring answer about intellectual credibility and honesty and…}

{nods off waiting for the chat box to finish populating}

So wait, what about glasses?  Let’s say there was a guild of the perfectly sighted. Yeah?  And nobody else could see so good.  And the perfect sighted folks got to make all the decisions and catch all the balls.

So one day, some-one invents glasses and the world rejoices because now everyone can see as well as the perfectly sighted guildies.  You get it? Instead of the game being all about “eyes” now the game is about who’s the best catch.

**“The Future of Academia: Glasses for Everyone, But the Game Relies on the Player”**

The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has some academics worried, fearing these ""glasses"" granting everyone access to information will diminish their value. However, the analogy breaks down. Unlike eyesight, knowledge is constantly evolving. LLMs need continuous updates, where public access with diverse perspectives becomes an advantage.

The true differentiator lies not in having the ""glasses"" (LLMs), but in how well you play the ""game"" (conduct research). Critical thinking becomes paramount. Can you analyze LLM outputs, identify biases, and formulate novel research questions that these AI assistants might miss?

Furthermore, weaving a compelling narrative from the information gathered is crucial. Just like baseball, academia will see a rise in specialization. A biochemist and a literary scholar might both use LLMs, but their critical thinking skills will differ. The future likely involves collaboration, with academics and LLMs working together, each leveraging their strengths.

In essence, LLMs democratize access to information, but success hinges on human strengths – critical thinking, unique perspectives, and the ability to interpret and communicate effectively. The future of research lies not in everyone having the same ""glasses,"" but in how each player uses them to contribute their unique perspective to the game of knowledge creation.""

Yesacadem was best known for his strong principled stance against slide rules, calculators, word processors, spell check, and the internet.

Or Grindy’s truly spectacular and multitudinous efforts to define the negative space of knowledge in his field.  Grindy could pump out three peer reviewed articles before breakfast… in cuneiform! Such scholarship. I’ve heard it said that only three people in all the world can understand the true depths of Grindy’s work!

Students are going to use LLMs… they are using LLMs. And the boring students are all going to use the LLMs in pretty much the same way.

Boringly.

Professionals are going to use LLMs. Professionals are using LLM’s.  Professionals are NOT using LLM’s in all the same boring ways, because knowledge is not actually the true heft professionals bring to the game anymore. Professionals are using creative expertise… critical thinking, analysis… and yes specialized knowledge.

But in general knowledge is the LLM’s job now.  Gemini “knows” more than any one person ever will. LLMs learn differently. Knowledge is now copied/disseminated differently, learned differently. Interacted with differently.

Professors will adapt and begin more closely identifying and training the heft of creative intellect instead of having to instruct students in the various forms.

It’s not like we can’t still cook over open fires and make stone tools. We have just realized we don’t need quite so many people trained to do that as did the Ancient Egyptians."

1bjcs26,1,2024-03-20,students using chatgpt to cheat in religion class & prof doesn’t care???,u/madeyal00ks,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/1bjcs26/students_using_chatgpt_to_cheat_in_religion_class/,"hi guys, this is my first post. Wanted to ask everyone’s opinion to see how I should move forward or if I should forget about this nonsense. I’m a 23F, junior at a public university studying psych and needed to take a Western Religion class to fulfill the literature req. i love school, always have but this professor is dreadful - reads directly from slides and will make changes to them in class, doesn’t share the lecture material, requires 25-100 pgs of weekly reading, didn’t get grades until week 6 and dqs are based on material that isn’t reviewed until the week after. He is a nice guy and was highly reviewed on ratemyprofessor but the problem is the dqs. 

Since we don’t review the matieral until the week after, it is very difficult to respond to the discussion questions without guessing if you’re being PC. i was looking through other students responses for insight, and 7/15 responses were using chatgpt to fully copy/paste!! No citations or basic changes, just blatantly stole a robots work. I couldn’t believe a human wrote it, so i individually copied their responses and pasted it into chat gpt asking “did chat gpt write this” and it said yes!!!!!! 

So, i took pictures and recently asked the professor if “i missed something during class” to see if we’re allowed to use AI (since his syllabus says he’s strongly against it and students will be reported to the provost). He said no we are not allowed, and asked why… to which I responded that I noticed students using it within discussion posts and I wanted to see if i could too. 

He was surprised and a bit defensive. I jokingly stated i had proof, in case he would like to see it and he said “no there isn’t much he can do to address it or way to fully prove it anyways.” (Although I was standing there with proof) I know im kinda a jerk for “snitching” on fellow students, but I’ve worked my ass off to get into this school and to pass this class and others are succeeding only because they’re cheating. Yes that’s life, but I don’t want to do nothing. 

Granted, they will be the ones to lose later on in life but it undermines academia and my grade itself. Even if i get a C+ I will be proud bc I have earned it, but im upset knowing others are excelling and curving the grade making this man think he’s a brilliant prof. I’m disappointed that he didn’t even acknowledge how serious this is, and it makes me believe he is either incompetent or doesn’t care enough to defend academia or his material. 

He’s an older gentleman who’s studied religion for 40+ years, you’d think he’d be more interested in preserving his life work and academia itself considering America is one of the only places we have the privilege of openly discussing/comparing religions. 

Do I leave this info with my professor and do nothing? Do I directly confront the students? Do I start cheating too to get a better grade? Should I figure out how to contact the provost directly and report the students AND the professor? Have you dealt with a similar situation? Please leave your feedback. I am so frustrated because I have no prior knowledge in any religion and was truly interested in learning more but now I resent it. I also resent paying 2k for a class that is taking up 70% of my time and is still going to tank my gpa, because the prof has no interest in “teaching”"
1bjhowa,1,2024-03-20,ChatGPT's Impact on Virtual Education and Corporate Training: An Effectiveness Discussion,u/cporter202,ChatGPTautomation,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTautomation/comments/1bjhowa/chatgpts_impact_on_virtual_education_and/,"Title: ChatGPT's Impact on Virtual Education and Corporate Training: An Effectiveness Discussion

The integration of AI like ChatGPT into virtual education and corporate training sectors marks a significant shift in how we approach teaching and knowledge transfer processes. As we delve deeper into this topic, let's explore the effectiveness of ChatGPT in these settings.

Virtual education, from K-12 to higher education, is increasingly adopting AI to supplement teaching. ChatGPT, with its conversational capabilities, offers a unique opportunity for personalized learning. Students can ask questions and receive instant feedback, potentially improving engagement and understanding. However, the effectiveness of such AI in facilitating deep learning as opposed to rote memorization is a point to examine.

In corporate training, ChatGPT could be vital in onboarding processes and ongoing education for employees. It can provide scalable, one-on-one interaction that would otherwise require significant human resources. Companies could leverage this to ensure their workforce is up-to-date with the latest skills and knowledge, but the question remains: can AI adequately replace the nuanced, human elements of corporate training?

Another angle to consider is the accessibility and inclusivity that ChatGPT could bring to the table. AI might lower barriers for individuals with different learning needs or those who speak different languages. Yet, this must be balanced against issues of digital divide and the need for equitable access to technology.

Let's discuss the practical effectiveness of ChatGPT in these educational frameworks. Have you experienced or implemented ChatGPT in your learning environment or company? What are the successes and challenges you've noticed? Share your insights as we consider whether this technology is just a novel tool or a transformative force in education and corporate training."
1bjn27b,113,2024-03-20,ChatGPT basically makes our TA work useless especially when professors just don't seem to care about students cheating and expect us to mark all their easily cheat-able little assignments,u/Practical_Ad_8802,PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1bjn27b/chatgpt_basically_makes_our_ta_work_useless/,"I was pretty angry yesterday when I read in my university's student newspaper interviewing undergrad students who had (apparently) used ChatGPT for their assignments. Obviously some students use ChatGPT but one student mentioned (under fake name) confessed to using ChatGPT for his courses in my discipline, courses that I, as a graduate student (first year PhD) TA have to mark. He said ""ChatGPT is essential for writing my philosophy essays,"" like, are you kidding me? Using ChatGPT for writing assignments ultimately only cheats the student of learning how to write properly, so before this I didn't really care...most of the time assignments that are obviously ChatGPT (in the humanities) are pretty bad, superficial, vague etc. so do not warrant a good mark anyways, so the student is already being penalized by a bad grade even if we can't prove it.

 But this makes me so frustrated because I'm currently working my butt off to get through endless marking for this one TA course I've been assigned to this semester, and spending MY time going above and beyond in trying to provide students feedback/comments etc, while this student (who may very well be in this course) is just wasting his TAs effort by submitting work he didn't even do himself, and smugly calling ChatGPT ""an essential resource"" bragging about it in the student paper. If these were multiple choice exams I wouldn't care, but marking essays--as anyone in the humanities know--is so time consuming (reading it, providing annotated feedback, detailed comments, correcting spelling and grammar ect.) Even more infuriating, while I would hope that he would be getting a bad mark if I was marking him--presumably he is not since he's pleased with ChatGPT-so one of my fellow grad students is clearly giving him and his garbage ChatGPT work a free pass, thereby rewarding the behaviour.

 Additionally, the proff for this course is next to useless, does not answer student emails (so they all come to me), does not give us (the TAs) any guidance or support on marking assignments (which is fine but then students complain to me about marks and I have no rubric or anything to justify myself), and worst of all, has SO MANY little endless assignments ( 3 1500 word exegetical essays, 3 1000 word short answer tests, and 5 discussion posts) that have taken up almost all my entire semester in marking (I have 52 students in my cohort). I have courses this year as a first-year PhD, and I've only finished one of my four for this semester...I still have so much of my own research and writing to do for my own essays but that has all gotten shoved to the end of the semester due to this endless marking. On top of this is my leading tutorial every week for this class (which is an hour a week but took me about 12 hours to prepare all of the materials and do the readings), and I also tend to host a weekly office hour because students come to me to ask/complain about their grade or want support (since the proff is never around), and I genuinely want my students to succeed in this course and give philosophy a fair go (since is a 100 level course). I make no extra money for this extra work since I am on a fixed salary, so it really depends on the proff you get...last semester I only had 1 essay and 1 exam to mark the ENTIRE semester for less students (about 30 in my cohort). 

I'm just angry because it seems professors have not clued into the fact that most students may very well be using ChatGPT to do their assignments, especially when all of the assignments are take-home open book tests or these mini essays that just require you to respond to a prompt. Some proffs also just don't care...last year I got assigned to TA a course that was almost as bad since the proff told the class ""nobody would get less than 70%"" in her class, and then got mad at me when I failed students who had clearly not done the work/answered the question and it was probably ChatGPT. Working for shitty proffs is always a risk as a TA I know that, but essentially all our (underpaid) effort is made to feel even more worthless with ChatGPT now, especially if proffs won't investigate these claims or make assignments more cheat-proof, and especially when proffs cram the course full of little assignments that take endless work to mark and easy to cheat with ChatGPT. 

Ugh. Sorry just had to take a break from marking my 52 essays for this week to rant. "
1bjv4k2,90,2024-03-20,This semester the quality of student work is awful!,u/Lumicat,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1bjv4k2/this_semester_the_quality_of_student_work_is_awful/,"This has been the worst semester I have had in almost 20 years. The writing quality was awful and on the first written assignment I caught 10% of my class (class has 140 students) either plagiarizing, using direct quotes in correctly, as in writing what you want and then putting it into direct quotes, or using AI.

I teach cognitive psychology which does deal with AI so I outlined how to cite AI which includes the AI model used, what prompts were used and then AI output. Under no circumstances is AI to ever be used for the student's own writing. 

So I create assignments with what I call traps. For example, if there are 7 questions, I will make sure 4 can't be answered with AI like having to cite a video. So then I have a nice writing sample comparison right in the assignment. I also use ChatGPT and created a bot, kind of a virtual TA, and fed it several hundred anonymized writing samples from previous classes so it knows what college writing looks like. In other words, it's easy to catch students. If I suspect a violation of academic integrity, I always meet with them on Zoom before I decide what's going to happen.

In the end, it took me almost 40 hours to grade 1 assignment because when I grade, I feel compelled to provide feedback on what lost them points and how to correct it.

A lot of students don't follow directions, their writing quality is so much worse, and they don't understand the basics of writing in science fields.

I am legit disturbed. I explained to the class that even university presidents could lose their job and career over this stuff and they are seniors at a University. After awhile it started to sink in, but it took way too much of my time and effort to get seniors in college to understand why writing properly and citing correctly is a good thing.

And I wonder if anyone else has noticed this in their students."

1bku21v,1,2024-03-22,recommendations for a stack for teaching students who think python is a snake,u/Bozo32,LocalLLaMA,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1bku21v/recommendations_for_a_stack_for_teaching_students/,"I will be teaching a course in qualitative analysis in about a month. I want to provide students with  a decent environment to test use of models/parameters. last year I used oobabooga. This year Ollama/openwebui looks better...but neither quite do it. This is what I need

essential

* Ease of use and access to parameters just like ollama/openwebui
* Iterating through documents for RAG rather than merging them (reports results by doc)
* A log that outputs interactions and model parameters so that we can compare results

gee...wouldn't that be nice

* multi step processes with loops/intermediate results etc.
* output of original but now annotated text

the multi-step process looks something like an agent. At this point I want students to direct things themselves. I'm OK with them creating multi -step instructions with loops etc. etc., I just don't want them handing that level of control off when they are clueless on programming.

do you have recommendations for what I should be using? 

my uni provides access to our cluster (AMD and NVIDIA) for teaching so resources are not a problem.

&#x200B;

Below is a bad script to give you an idea where I would eventually like to go...I''m pretty sure models don't support this kind of work yet. I have similar scripts for things like metaphor analysis. Content analysis (both deductive and inductive) are trivial by comparison...and are where I'll start.

\## Integrated Instructions for Recursive Toulmin Argument Analysis with Red Agent Critique on Uploaded .txt File

\### Preliminary Step

Upload a  file containing the text you wish to analyze.

\### System Prompt for Initial Analysis

system\_prompt\_analysis = ""Perform a recursive Toulmin Argument Analysis on the uploaded file with confidence levels and validation. The final claim you will be recursively analysing is  (insert text).""

&#x200B;

\### Task Objective for Initial Analysis

Your task is to recursively analyze the argument structure of the uploaded file using a recursive adaptation of the Toulmin Argument Analysis method. In this approach 'backing' and 'qualifiers' are replaced by recursive use of 'claim'. For example, where a warrant (warrant 1) supporting the final claim of an article (claim 1) would normally be recognised as having backing, when treated recursively, that warrant (warrant 1) is, itself, recognised as a subordinate claim (claim 2)  which, itself, has supporting data(s) (data 2) and warrant(s) (warrant 2). 

\### Required Components for Initial Analysis

You must identify and label the following components in each layer of the argument:

\- Claim (content of claim) (justification for why you think this is a claim)

\- Data (content) (justification for why you think this data are related to the claim)

\- Warrant (content) (justification for why you think this warrant links related data to related claim)

\### Format for Argument 

For each layer of argumentation, represent the components as follows:

<argument N>  ## where N is the layer number. when a superordinate argument is jointly conditional, label arguments Na, Nb etc.

<claim> {content} (Justification)

<data (a,b,c when multiple sources support the claim)> {content} (Justification)

<warrant (a, b, c when multiple warrants support the claim)> {content) (Justification)

\### Analysis Steps for Recursive Structure for Initial Analysis

1. The claim (insert text) is the conclusion that the text supports.  It is the final point to which the entire text is building. Label this as <argument1><claim>. For the rest of this process, you will be working backwards from this main claim to identify how it is supported.

2. Identify and label data and warrants directly relevant to the main claim. Create a clearly stated  justification which clarifies why you think that text deserves the label you have given it.

3. If data or warrants are missing, infer (e.g. when you find data used to justify a claim, but no warrant is given, then you must infer what must be true for that data to support the claim. For example, academics often present citations of other's work. For that warrant to hold, that work must be both valid in on its own and relevant to the context in which the current author is working.) Make sure you provide the justification for why you think this inferred argument component is both necessary and appropriate.

4. For each data and warrant that was explicitly stated (i.e. ignoring those that are implicit), create a new layer of argument (<argumentN+1>), and identify any supporting claims, grounds, or warrants (both implicit and explicit). Label each appropriately. Include justifications.

5. Reference which components in the superordinate layer (argumentN) are being supported by argument N+1 as follows (Argument N+1 supports Argument N warrant(a)). Multiple references are allowed.

6. Continue recursively until all layers of argumentation have been identified, labeled, and referenced, exhausting only the uploaded file.

\### Red Agent Prompt

red\_agent\_prompt = ""Critique the initial Toulmin Argument Analysis of the uploaded file for inconsistencies, weaknesses, and ambiguities.""

\## Explicitly stating the task for the Red Agent to ensure it adopts a contrarian, critical perspective.

\### Red Agent Objective

Your task as the Red Agent is to rigorously critique the initial Toulmin Argument Analysis of the uploaded  file. Identify any inconsistencies, weaknesses, or ambiguities in the extracted argument layers and components. Provide counter-arguments where necessary.

\## Clearly defining the Red Agent's objective to ensure focused critique.

&#x200B;

\### Red Agent Steps for Initial Extraction Critique

1. Review each extracted component (claim, data, warrant).

2. Using the text in the file, challenge the validity of components by providing counter-arguments or alternative interpretations.

3. Point out any inconsistencies or ambiguities in the links between components.

4. Generate a list of critiques for each argument layer, focusing on weaknesses and inconsistencies.

&#x200B;

\### Red Agent Steps for Validation Phase

1. After the recursive extraction is complete, review the entire argument structure.

2. Identify any overarching weaknesses, inconsistencies, or ambiguities.

3. Challenge the main claim by considering whether alternative interpretations of the data or different main claims could be equally or more valid.

4. Generate a final list of critiques that looks at the argument structure as a whole.

&#x200B;

\### Red Agent Steps for Consensus Building

1. Present your critiques to the initial extraction agent.

2. Engage in a back-and-forth discussion to resolve identified issues.

3. If the initial extraction is revised, review the changes and repeat the critique process.

4. Continue this process until a consensus is reached on the most robust and accurate representation of the argument structure in the uploaded file.

&#x200B;

\###Reporting prompt

Report the consensus toulmin argument in hierarchical outline style. Where interaction with the red agent identified viable alternative interpretations, present those as 'options'.

1bllhef,31,2024-03-23,"As a student, I feel for teachers",u/bluetreeacre,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1bllhef/as_a_student_i_feel_for_teachers/,"New account for anonymity. I'm a senior student who is also a ""tutor"" in a public school and I have a passion for education. As a student, i love to foster community. I'm fortunate to have had a great experience with most of the teachers and adults in the school, but so many other kids haven't and there are so many rumours about teachers that just drive me mad.

Onto my actual point. I feel like my current education system is really failing students, and the advancement of technology has really contributed to this.   It feels like students really just want to be spoonfed answers (I think social media becoming so heavily personalized has really worsened this issue) and then are upset when they're not given. 

When these kids don't get that spoonfed answer, they react very emotionally and instead of trying to find a solution, they blow it out of proportion and attempt to get teachers fired, punished, and worse. The way that students use these emotions to try and hurt the adults who care deeply about them honestly saddens me. 

It makes me pretty upset, but I feel especially bad for the teachers who get complaints about this. Personally, I've always been a really nerdy kid and I swear to god the amount of times I hear kids using chatgpt to do all their work for them or who give up and ask me for the answer to copy after barely trying... it really saddens me.

I am curious to hear what you all have to say as educators? I would love to hear perspective from teachers! Wishing you all the best!

# Introduction

Remote work has radically transformed the modern job market. The pandemic accelerated the widespread adoption of flexible working arrangements, allowing millions of employees to fulfill their responsibilities outside of a traditional office setting. As workers have come to appreciate the benefits of this flexible model, the demand for high-quality remote job opportunities has steadily increased.

This article explores the top companies fulfilling this demand by offering remote roles compensated at $100,000 or more annually. With growing employee expectations around flexibility, understanding where these opportunities exist can help both job seekers and employers of the future. Sections will cover the rise of remote work, preferred job characteristics, the shifting priorities of companies and employees post-pandemic, and strategies for securing these lucrative remote positions.

## The Shift Towards Remote Work

### The Impact of COVID-19

When the pandemic hit in early 2020, most organizations had little choice but to rapidly transition their workforces to remote environments. This large-scale, unplanned experiment in flexible working proved work from home arrangements could succeed at a wide scale. Remote work job searches increased 217% on Google from March 2019 as employees embraced the autonomy, work-life balance and other benefits flexibility provided.

### The McKinsey Study

In a notable 2022 study, McKinsey found flexible working was the second most important job characteristic for job seekers after compensation. Researchers polled over 25,000 Americans and found 65% were willing to work remotely full-time if given the option, versus the 58% who reported actually having some level of flexibility.

### The Challenge of RTO

As pandemic restrictions eased, some employers have mandated a return to the traditional office. However, these “return to office” (RTO) policies often conflict with worker priorities uncovered by McKinsey. Tensions have emerged between those valuing presence-based team collaboration and those wanting more control over their schedules. Understanding differing viewpoints will be important to attract and retain top talent moving forward.

## The Top Remote Job Companies

### Accountant: The #1 Remote Job

According to a January 2024 CNBC article, accountant is currently the most in-demand remote-friendly profession. Demand stems from an aging workforce nearing retirement, fewer students entering the field, and evolving compliance and reporting needs brought on by advancing regulations and technologies.

Remote accounting provides desirable flexibility while still offering stable, recession-proof work valued between $68,000 to over $200,000 annually depending on experience level. Leading recruiters for remote accounting positions include Kforce, Supporting Strategies and Lee Hecht Harrison offering tax, auditing and financial analyst roles.

### 15 Companies Offering $100K+ Remote Jobs

## Strategies for Securing High-Paying Remote Jobs

The following best practices can help job seekers stand out and land one of these coveted remote opportunities:

### Develop Relevant Skills

Continuously upgrading qualifications through online courses and hands-on projects keeps candidates competitive in a changing market. Certifications also carry weight for some technical roles.

### Build a Targeted Resume

Customize resumes and cover letters to directly address each job listing. Quantify past achievements and tailor content to the employer's needs and culture.

### Leverage Professional Network

Reach out to connections within the target industry to learn more about companies and openings. Stay active on platforms like LinkedIn to build visibility and make new beneficial connections.

### Showcase Your Expertise

Share knowledge and work through an online portfolio or personal brand. Maintain an active professional presence across multiple online channels to establish credibility and attract opportunities.

### Highlight Key Qualifications

Research each company and role to emphasize important hard and soft skills. Prepare to demonstrate qualifications that match what employers need, both technical and leadership abilities.

## Conclusion

Remote work offers employees more flexibility and work-life balance while helping many companies expand their talent pools. As the job market continues prioritizing flexibility, exploring opportunities like the high-paying remote roles profiled will connect job seekers with forward-thinking employers. By developing in-demand skills, optimizing online presence, and leveraging professional networks, applicants can enhance their chances of securing one of these lucrative remote positions.

 I wonder if it’s me facing the problem with lack of time for preparing for all the lesson or it’s everyone. I work and live in Ukraine, have 21 lesson per week. All the weekends I try to find some materials and prepare interesting lessons. It’s pretty exhausting. Sometimes I’m lucky and find cool lesson plans, sometimes I use ChatGPT to invent the lesson plan myself, sometimes I search for exercises in different student books, because the student book we use in our school sucks. We have spring break for a week now. And I’m going to spend this time by preparing my lessons. Is there a way to make it faster? "

How is that possible? I mean in academic papers, don't you have to cite academic sources and come up with arguments based on them anyways? Or like do actual research? I mean i would get it, if you use it to write an essay, where you simply type in the prompt and copy the result, but academic papers? I would use chatgpt to ask it, if the wording (of the content i researched) sound clear or how they improve the lines so the flow is better, does that already count as written by chatgpt and therefore being a reason to let you fail?

1bmu64x,50,2024-03-24,"New user beginning guide: from total noob to well-informed user, part 3/3",u/nuclear_prof,LocalLLaMA,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1bmu64x/new_user_beginning_guide_from_total_noob_to/,"**# Fine-tuning**

Should I use a particular framework? Let’s say I fine-tune my model over different use-cases. How do I swap the weights for these different models efficiently?

**Warning**: Fine-tuning is the last section on purpose. If this is the first thing you are considering, you are probably doing something wrong. Fine-tuning is the last thing to consider, not the first. Once you learn enough, you may find out you don’t need it. And if you do need it, you may find practical constraints that make it not worth it. Or perhaps you do need it, you are very persistent, and you are willing to pay the price. Great, let’s do it!

Let’s go back to the JPG example. Yes, you need software that allows you to edit (fine-tune) LLM, just like you need “special” software to edit JPG, PDF, DOC. Probably the easiest options are text-generation-webui, Axolotl, and Unsloth. You can fine-tune quantized models (QLoRA), but as far as I know, it can be done only on GPU. See their website for a description of which model, training, quant types they support. And you can find plenty of step-by-step guides/tutorials on the web (see “Next steps”).

As far as swapping weights, well, you can just open and edit a new JPG when you are done with the previous one, no? The same applies here. There is no fundamental problem of loading multiple LLMs at once and interacting with each of them as needed (just like you can open multiple JPG at once and interact with them as needed). But since LLMs take up so much memory, loading two is 2x memory. That’s how Mixtral-8x7B model works, it loads 2 (or 3?) 7B models and use them together at the same time. Do you have enough RAM/VRAM? Go for it!

Now back to fine-tuning. A basic concept that I didn't understand at the beginning is that fine-tuning is **not** for adding knowledge. If it were, all models could be fine-tuned on Wikipedia, and we would have a custom, instant, and accurate (assuming Wikipedia is accurate) encyclopedia in our pocket. It would answer a specific/narrow question of interest instead of showing a long and boring Wikipedia article on a long and boring topic. Life would be great! But did you know even the best of the best (GPT-4) makes factual errors that are correct on Wikipedia? Why? Surely, OpenAI could (and did) train on Wikipedia. This should tell you something.

So, the most important thing to understand is that fine-tuning is for adding “skills”, not “knowledge”. For example, question answering, summarization, translation, conversation, code completion, fillin-mask, sentence/semantic similarity, I’m sure there is more. And once the LLM is big enough, it also gets “emergent” abilities (debatable, but it makes us feel supersmart, so let’s just go with it). So first you need to know what “skill” you want to add. Otherwise, you are probably not improving anything, and very likely making the existing abilities worse (there are plenty of posts on that). Maybe others can say more what “skills” are interesting and useful to add for different use cases?

Now back to the issue of why fine-tuning is the last thing to do, and best to avoid, unless absolutely necessary. The first problem is that hardware requirements increase beyond the typical “home computer”. Just to remind you of the scale of the problem, recall training a new model from scratch, see “Creating Parameters” section on the blog I linked to earlier.

Fine-tuning is effectively the same, but with a much smaller data set, targeted at specific “skill” rather than ""ingesting raw text"". And perhaps you don’t need to adjust all the weights, but just some of them, which makes it computationally easier. That’s where LoRA comes into play.

You can also fine-tune some quantized models (QLoRA), but as far as I know, it is GPU only (please correct me if I’m wrong). The solution to this problem is easy in the sense that you can just buy more/better GPU. But the general advice is that it is much cheaper and more efficient to rent a GPU from an AI cloud provider, there are other posts here on how to do that and what are good practical options.

The second problem relates to the data requirement, how training and fine-tuning works. What you need is a pair of text “prompt” and “completion”, where “completion” is a natural continuation of the “prompt”. At first, it seems like an easy problem, just search the web, you’ll find TBs of training data, all you need is fast internet and plenty of HDD space! But think about it, if there is a good publicly availability training data set, wouldn’t others already use it? They did. So, even though there are plenty of public data sets on the web, what’s the point of re-training on the same data? Maybe you think, well, I'll just train anyway, it can't hurt, it is just like reading the same book 10x. But that's wrong. Training too much on the same data will “overfit” (or “overtrain”) your model, which will make it worse!

You can (and should!) use public training data to learn how to do it, what are different options, what results/improvement you can get. But to do something really useful, you need to curate your own prompt/completion data set. At this point, the time requirements increase to weeks-months to curate your own data yourself. But let’s stay you did create it (there are fast and easy ways to create a poor-quality set) and trained on it. If you are happy with the results, good for you, you are done.

But, to get the best performance, you need to fine-tune with human evaluation: you ask your new LLM to generate a few answers/completions to the same prompt, and a human (you?) picks the best answer/completion. Repeat thousands of times. Oh, you would rather not do that yourself? OK, no problem, hire 10 local college students to do it for you. That's what big companies do, except instead of local high schools, they use workers in low-wage countries. Or you get clever and come up with an automated way: create another LLM that can judge responses of your new LLM, picks the best one and feeds it back to your new LLM. But then you need a “judge LLM” which has to be much better than your new LLM. Can you run full size 70B model locally? Good, do that, but then perhaps you don't need that new LLM?

Then, you need to evaluate if your new LLM really is better. So, you need another set of prompts/completions as a benchmark to measure “improvement”. The public benchmarks used for ranking (like HuggingFace Leaderboard) are not useful here (see “Model selection” section), you need your own benchmark that you keep private. Perhaps you use a part of your curated prompt/completion data set that you didn't use for training. Perhaps you create a new set. Either way, improvement measurement is a critical part that too many misses or ignore.

If you still haven't given up, congratulations, you are the top 1%! Now you really have to go back to parts I marked (A), (B), (C), (D) and work to understand the rest. Search the web (see “Next steps” section), there are plenty of tutorials that show step-by-step instructions for different use cases. But first, you need to understand what you want your “fine-tuning” for, and then look for a method and software (and hardware!) that does that, not the other way around.

**# Next steps**

There is plenty more. The problem is that a web search on any of these topics will return 1000s of articles, you’ll end up with info overload, or conflicting info, or the same info, but described differently, or you become paralyzed by looking for the “best”.

If you lack technical skills (from “LLM loader overload” and everything later), here is how to get started. First, get Anaconda and learn how to create conda environments with specific Python version, how to load/unload environment, and how to work within these environments. My recommendation is to **not** work with your OS native Python (e.g., not to use “python -m venv env\_name”) but rather with a separate Python installation (e.g., Anaconda) and its environment (e.g., ""conda create -n env\_name""). Both ways are perfectly fine, but my recommendation is to not touch OS native Python at all.

Then, learn how to clone git repository, then how to set up necessary dependencies (should be part of repo instructions), then how to compile yourself (should be part of repo instructions). Then continue with whatever it is you want to do.

Don’t give up. To avoid info overload, here is the order of reading and learning I recommend:

1. Go back to (A), (B), (C), (D), fill in the specific gaps in your understanding. You’ll probably find that as you learn more, more of this becomes “easy” and “obvious”.

2. Next, search for other relevant posts on /r/LocalLLaMA/, use the flair system, it is here to help.

3. Next, search Medium and related property (they own or affiliate with a ton of other websites!). It has a lot of general info and ready-to-use tutorials, but the quality varies (and a lot of low-effort LLM-generated posts). Watch out for info overload!

4. Then, search GitHub Awesome lists for specific topics and your needs. At this point, expect info overload, unless you know specifically what you need.

5. Finally, as the last resort, go to open web, it is definitely info overload!

Finally, my advice is that looking for the “best” is a failing strategy. FreeBSD and Photoshop are the best, why are you not using them? First, understand what you really want to do, what you want to accomplish. Then look for the tool/method/software that does that. That is the best tool/method/software for you, not for me.

**# Closing perspective**

I'm disappointed with posts that can be summarized as “I don't know anything about this, but I had this brilliant idea about AGI + fine-tune on all my data + Wikipedia which will be my own personal genius, I haven't bothered to do any homework myself because it is too boring and too difficult for me, so just tell me step-by-step instructions that will work on my computer. Oh, and make it the best. Otherwise, it is not good enough for me”.

Consider a bit of humility and perspective. LLMs are barely out of the best NLP research labs with post-PhD level brains (I mean humans), so +10 years of the best university education in the world. These are incredibly difficult and advanced topics that others spent years learning and developing. And they made it easy enough for us (relatively competent person without formal CS or NLP education) to self-learn and use for a real benefit to us.

If you want things to be as easy as JPG and PDF on your computer, if you want an automatic fully integrated solution, just go with Windows 11 and MS Copilot. MS integrated it into the OS, and it works seamlessly just like JPG and PDF. You'll have an AI assistant that's one of the best in the world, which will scan/index all your data, and work seamlessly just like other good software on your computer. There is no problem or shame in that. I use ChatGPT and Copilot, and I'm mostly impressed. The weaknesses are obvious enough that it will improve, just like all other software/hardware improved over the years. Think about your favorite software 5, 10, 20 years ago and what it did (or didn't do), and how it got better (or worse) over the years. The progress in 10–20 years is just spectacular!

Or, if you want high (not complete, but high) control over the workflow and data, and you keep insisting on the “best” it is OpenAI, Anthropic, Microsoft, Google. They all have a “cookbook” with ready-to-use Python examples for all typical use cases. Just search ""OpenAI cookbook"".

It will cost you pennies or a few dollars to run, and you’ll get one of the best embeddings, one of the best LLM, one of the best RAG (chunking/embedding/vector DB), one of the best fine-tuning, all tools-software-hardware maintained for you, integrated hosting, and much faster than you can do at home. If you want the “best”, do that.

Good luck, fellow explorers!"

Without my tuition teacher and chatgpt help idk who to rely on you know my teacher is not really helpful as she said she's not a tuition teacher so she don't help students 1 to 1 then I don't have friends from my amath class because I'm the only girl in my amath class. At this point I feel like giving up the whole amath subject bruh idk how I managed to get a grade 1 (na btw) people see that I'm good at amath on the outside but actually there's many dark shit is happening to me rn there's someone close to me pass away recently and I feel like just crying it all out and now amath is making me feel nasty.

1bnvily,2,2024-03-25,Senior High School Research Paper (Potential concept: Maximal Flow Using Ford-Fulkerson),u/Impossible-Damage246,learnmath,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/comments/1bnvily/senior_high_school_research_paper_potential/,"Hello, good day to you. I want to ask for help on a specific topic. My sister, a Grade 11 student, is asking help for her research. She's a very competitive kid and desires to produce a very good research project. When her advisor mentioned that proposals on mathematical problems are 'rare', because scientific ones are more preferred, she decided to explore a mathematical topic that would give her an advantage in terms of awards and recognition.

Some context: I completed a Math program in college, which is why she approached me for help, even though I didn't exactly pursue that field. It's been almost 10 years since I last faced challenging Math problems. Since college, I haven't had many opportunities to apply those concepts, except for perhaps the logical aspect, as I got into the tech field (started out as a programmer). I genuinely want to help her, as this could increase her chances of getting into a good university for college, but I'm aware that my knowledge on this subject is limited, and we need guidance.

—
The approved topic (no official title yet) is: ""Optimizing the waste collection process in a city to minimize transportation costs and maximize the efficiency of waste disposal.""

After doing some online research, I came across the concept of Maximal Flow, which seems relevant to the topic. I also discovered the Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm, which could potentially be our method if applicable and feasible.

Now, here are my questions:

1. Is the research topic good / suitable? Does it make sense? We proposed other topics, but this one was approved.
2. Is the concept of Maximal Flow applicable to this topic?
3. Is the Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm the best choice for a high school research project? (Timeline may be around 3-8months depending on the complexity)
4. I'm having trouble finding comprehensive resources online that explain the Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm thoroughly. Could you recommend reliable resources where we can learn the concept and most importantly, its application effectively? This could be a book, video resource, article, etc.
5. Do you have any idea what data we would need for this topic? Which data should we gather to input into the algorithm?
6. I'm considering whether this could be solved through programming. I have a it of understanding of Python because to my job... So, do you know of any resources, like a GitHub repo that has a program that solves Ford-Fulkerson problems?

I've considered seeking assistance from ChatGPT for this, including the coding aspect, but I'm hesitant. I only want to include factual information in my sister's paper. Additionally, I read the rules/notes in this sub about not using ChatGPT for computations.

I'm glad I found this subreddit and see helpful people here. I hope my questions are appropriate, and I truly appreciate any assistance. Thank you in advance.

(Apologies if any information is missing. I might have missed it due to my lack of understanding of the topic. Please feel free to ask for additional information if needed to provide your answer. Thanks a lot!)"

Student has been submitting ChatGPT essays all semester. I've had three meetings with him but was unable to ""prove"" anything until he sent in an essay that begins with ""Although I don't experience emotions, I can understand how the story might elicit sympathy"". His hand-written work on the exam is completely different. 

Student is now appealing my decision to give him an F for the class. 

&#x200B;

**Now:** 

While I wait for all of the appeal stuff to happen (this is my first time), the student can still attend class and send in work, obviously. 

I feel like I'm in the twilight zone because the student just sent me another obvious ChatGPT assignment. Is this a joke? Am I on a hidden camera show? 

My other seven students are an absolute pleasure to teach, and they're actually passionate about the material. They work hard. This is the first time I've had to deal with a student who just doesn't give a damn. "
1boxpyb,17,2024-03-27,AI Tools for Students: From AI Essay Generators to AI Coding Assistants,u/CheerfulCharlie7,ArtificialInteligence,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1boxpyb/ai_tools_for_students_from_ai_essay_generators_to/,"I've noticed more than 2,000 new AI tools hitting the market in the last 30 days! As a student, I'm especially interested in finding AI tools that can help with studying. These aren't just essay generators or note-taking apps. While we all know about ChatGPT and Grammarly, some lesser-known tools are also making a big difference.  
So, I've compiled a list of the top 9 AI tools focused on educational use tools that I personally use to improve my efficiency and output.  
**AI tool**	          **Category**	                       **Use for**  
**1. ChatGPT	  AI Writing**	                         This platform allows students to ask queries, request help, or     simply chat with the AI in a dynamic and interactive manner. It's great for brainstorming essay topics and seeking suggestions on how to improve your writing style. But I don't recommend it as an autonomous AI essay writer; always add your own thoughts.  
**2. Blainy   	  AI Writing**	                          It helps students improve their writing with real-time grammar checks and editing suggestions, and also have other features like citations, Ai automation, whether you're working on a manuscript or using MS Word. I used it to improve my article. It could be better described as an AI research assistant.  
**3. Lateral	   Taking notes**	                 The tool helps students efficiently manage and search through academic papers. I think it really makes the research process more organized. It can also identify connections between documents and provide relevant content that may have been missed.  
**4. Glasp	           Taking notes**	                 This is a browser extension that lets students highlight important information on websites and share it with others. It's great for saving and finding useful study material.  
**5. Tutor AI	    Learning**		                 It helps students understand tough subjects with personalized lessons. Just enter the topic you're interested in and get suggestions for information to learn.  
**6. Doctrina AI         Learning**	                 It offers a range of tools to help students excel academically, from summarizing class notes to interactive quizzes. It can also be used as an essay writer. You can organize your study materials or prepare for exams with this tool.  
**7. Copyscape	Plagiarism Checker**	I use Copyscape to make sure my academic papers are original before submitting them. It checks for any duplicate content on the web, so I can trust that my work is unique and avoid plagiarism issues.  
**8. Otter AI	    Records audio** 	               Students can use the tool to get real-time transcriptions of lectures or study group meetings. It not only records audio but also automatically captures slides and generates summaries, making it easier for students to review and share notes.  
**9. Slidesgo	    Presentations** 		       I can use this tool to find free templates for presentations. It saves me time on design, so I can focus more on the content. It's convenient that you can see the trending searches for designs on the website.  
If you have some better suggestions kindly share them below in the comments.

1boyqaq,293,2024-03-27,"Kind of Disheartened by the ""AI is here to stay"" attitude",u/ProfessorNoConfessor,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1boyqaq/kind_of_disheartened_by_the_ai_is_here_to_stay/,"Not even getting into the techno inevitability argument --- we can take it for granted --- how is this different than, say, spell check or new Calculators having a CAS? The only difference is in scale, since ChatGPT/LLMs are *kind of* general purpose. Otherwise, I don't see how this is different than 

* calculators allowing students to skip learning arithmetic
* computer algebra systems allowing students to skip learning basic algebra/trig/calculus
* spell-check allowing students to skip learning to spell

None of these things are going away, but we've agreed that we should not encourage their use (especially in the classroom) until the appropriate setting.

So why are we not applying the same standard to AI? Instead of ""it's here to stay, we should teach them how to apply it to their lives,"" we can apply the same logic as for a calculator: they're here to stay, but students won't develop good number sense if they use them instead of learning arithmetic, so we discourage/forbid their use as much as possible until the appropriate age (or setting --- e.g. some subset of problems where calculator use is fine).

I also almost exclusively hear this line from fellow STEM (especially tech) people. 🤷"
1bp66ey,1,2024-03-27,"""ChatGPT's Impact on Virtual Learning: Revolutionizing Education and Corporate Training""",u/cporter202,ChatGPTautomation,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTautomation/comments/1bp66ey/chatgpts_impact_on_virtual_learning/,"The advent of AI entities like ChatGPT has catalyzed a transformative movement in the realms of education and corporate training. With virtual learning becoming increasingly prevalent, especially post the onset of the pandemic, ChatGPT emerges as a formidable force, potentially revolutionizing how knowledge is delivered and consumed.

For students and learners across the globe, the implications are profound. ChatGPT's sophisticated language model facilitates a personalized learning experience, adapting to individual proficiency levels and learning styles. This is particularly beneficial for those wishing to learn at their own pace, and for educational institutions striving to cater to diverse learning needs.

In the corporate sector, training programs are being revamped with AI-driven simulations and interactive sessions helmed by ChatGPT and its ilk. These programs emulate real-world scenarios, equipping employees with practical skills and decision-making capabilities. Unlike traditional learning modules, this AI-infused approach ensures engagement and retention of knowledge by actively involving the learner in the training process.

Moreover, ChatGPT allows for continuous learning opportunities. With 24/7 availability, it stands as an ever-present mentor, ready to assist, clarify doubts, or explore deep dives into topics of interest. This increases accessibility for learners across different time zones, removing barriers that once hindered the pursuit of education or professional development.

Despite its many benefits, the integration of AI like ChatGPT in education and training does pose certain questions – particularly around the extent of human touch necessary for effective learning and the management of biases within the AI's learning algorithms.

What's undebatable, however, is the mark ChatGPT has made, and will continue to make, on virtual learning landscapes. Its potential to democratize education, tailor learning experiences, and upscale corporate training methods is intriguing and invites a discourse on the best ways to harness this technology for a more educated and skillful future."
1bpzv8x,1,2024-03-28,Leveraging ChatGPT for Data Analysis and Reporting in Various Industries,u/cporter202,ChatGPTautomation,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTautomation/comments/1bpzv8x/leveraging_chatgpt_for_data_analysis_and/,"Hello Reddit community!

In today's digital age, data is often referred to as the new oil, serving as a critical asset that drives innovation and enhances operational efficiencies across various industries. With the increasing amount of data being generated, the need for powerful analytical tools and reporting mechanisms has become paramount. That's where leveraging advanced AI like ChatGPT for data analysis and reporting comes into play.

ChatGPT, with its state-of-the-art language models, holds great potential in transforming the way we handle data. It simplifies the extraction of actionable insights from complex datasets and makes it accessible even to those who may not have a strong background in data science.

For starters, in healthcare, ChatGPT can assist in analyzing patient data to identify trends, recommend treatments, and even predict outbreaks. It can process medical research and assist practitioners in staying up-to-date with the latest findings. In the realm of finance, ChatGPT can automate reporting processes, evaluate risk assessments, and provide real-time analysis to improve decision-making. 

In the retail industry, AI-powered chatbots can not only provide personalized shopping experiences but can also analyze customer feedback and behavior to optimize inventory management and marketing strategies. Meanwhile, in manufacturing, they can interpret machine data to predict maintenance needs and streamline supply chain operations.

The education sector can benefit from ChatGPT by deriving insights from student performance data to tailor educational content and identify areas where students might need additional support. Even in entertainment, data analysis can help in understanding audience preferences and shaping future content creation.

The key to leveraging ChatGPT effectively lies in how we integrate it into existing data workflows. We need to ensure we set clear objectives, maintain data quality, and address any privacy concerns. By doing so, we can harness the power of ChatGPT to not just analyze data, but also generate comprehensive reports that are easy to understand and act on.

The use of ChatGPT for data analysis and reporting marks the beginning of a new era in data-driven decision-making. The potential is immense, and as we continue to explore this promising combination, the prospect of uncovering deeper insights and achieving greater efficiency across industries looks more attainable than ever.

Let's discuss further on how ChatGPT can be implemented across different sectors and the challenges we might face along the way. Share your thoughts and experiences, or pose questions if you're curious about the practical applications of AI in the realm of data!"

While applying to colleges I couldn’t see myself in any other major so computer science felt like the perfect choice but the moment I become a freshman, the imposter syndrome hit hard. I never coded before while half my peers already had their own websites the codes from scratch and literally did coding as a hobby. To have a community, I made friends with other cs majors who were total beginners and somehow got through freshman year with the help of friends and chatgpt. I was barely surviving (Bs and Cs) and lost a few friends in cs bc they changed majors after second semester’s OOP course

Then in the first semester of sophomore year, we had DSA and it was dubbed the first actual weed out course. It was and it did. I failed that course and my grades in other courses drastically dropped too. Most of my friends switched majors again, i literally don’t have that community anymore. 

While I was trying to survive in this major, go to clubs, network, find internships, hangout with friends and have everything together, two years almost passed. I’ve failed until now and am left with no experience, no good projects and a painful gpa of 2.07. 

I can’t seem to find any internship or research over the summer bc of my gpa. I want to be in computer science and go to grad school but I’m so lost. My transcripts are so bad that I don’t even want my advisor to look at it. I’m scared that I’ve already ruined my chances to bag a good internship, do research or go to a top post grad program. My professors will only consider a student for research if they have a gpa of 3.5 and above. Even if I get a 4.0 in every semester from now, I might not hit that mark. 

AM I DONE FOR? "

I work with students 3 days a week, and there is always this group that complains all the time about “When am I ever going to need this?” “ChatGPT could just do this for me.” I do realize it is like talking to a door when they aren’t in a mindset of actually talking about how this class is useful, I do respond with something like “well someone decided for your major you need to be able to do precalc” or “this is more than just doing the math, it’s about problem solving” and “ChatGPT is actually really bad at math, and I’m sure in whatever career they don’t want someone who just uses AI.” I was wondering if anyone has anything else I could say when they start complaining to me about math.

1bruzl6,299,2024-03-30,Another Rant about Students ,u/clockwatcher1200,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1bruzl6/another_rant_about_students/,"By this time in the semester, I’ve usually grown very fond of my students, but this semester is different. I dread teaching and feel disconnecting from my students.

It’s everything: the CHATGPT, the tardiness, the phones, the indifference, the rudeness, and the continual and unreasonable demands.

They don’t read the assignments, and they do their work improperly. They just don’t care. 

One class thinks I’m rude because I’m no longer polite when I tell them to stop talking or get off their phones.

While I realize this critique is gendered  (as I am a young woman), I’m worn out. 

Last week a student said she thought I was rude when I told I get off her phone, and “that’s why [she] continued to use.” I said that that was her choice, but I was fuming inside.

I realize I’m not alone in this expensive, but 95% of them have no curiosity nor a desire to learn.

1bs2xj3,17,2024-03-31,"Dear students, the system is f***ed and it’s not your fault. Don’t lose your fire. ",u/Basic_MilkMotel,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1bs2xj3/dear_students_the_system_is_fed_and_its_not_your/,"Hold on to your hats because this one is a doozy. First of all I’d like to introduce myself, I am *pseudonym here* and I am a mid-thirties woman that teaches digital art at the high school level. 

I know a lot of students (and parents) read this sub, just as I read ER subs but I am not in emergency services. I’m sure you read over and over about how your generation isn’t reading at grade level and or meeting math standards. You were born into an age where cell phones provided instant gratification and that did something to your brains (I’m sure it’s done something to MY brain, but the first iPhone came out when I was in college—my brain was mostly developed). When I am not at work I spend too much time on my phone. 

It’s not your fault. There was a major shift culturally and we are seeing it again with Ai (I use ChatGPT to help write my lessons…shhhh) and I’m sure we will see the repercussions of that in due time. I do not think you’re all a bunch of dummies because I teach art and I see students do amazing in my course and think about how there’s no “behind in art” “art disabled” because our society doesn’t value art as much as it values math, reading, statistics and numbers. Heck, some of my best art students are failing. I try my best to meet them half way. I cannot comprehend how stressful it is for my colleagues in math and ELA because the tests you take turn into data which then admin use to reflect the efficiency of your teachers. Even though I am no directly affected by this data, when my students say “I am just going to guess.” I say “nooooooo!” I work at a title one school with amazing teachers but a lot of our students really don’t give a F. I use to hear people say that teaching was the easiest most pleasant part of the profession. It is. Everything that you don’t see sucks. The one time I put my foot down at a student out of line, her and her mother came to the school and I got a talking to about how she felt attacked. In middle school I got detention for talking during a ceremony. Some students treat us like absolute trash and there’s nothing we can do. We are people too!  But I remember not being the nicest to some of my teachers, for stupid reasons—one was that this lady took over the position of a teacher I was really looking forward to having because he didn’t get his credential in time. 

Our hands are tied. We can’t give you consequences for not doing anything. Anything we do that could be perceived as a consequence teeters on danger for us, so if we are disrespected we are even more pitiful because he have to take it (I’m not saying I want to punch you, but like, it would be cool if your parents took your phone for a day if you were extremely disrespectful). 

I got into teaching because I grew up in a neglectful and abusive household. I thought I was incapable of anything because every time I brought up a dream or something I wanted to do I was shut down. But I had teachers that legitimately changed my life. To this day, I might still think I’m a talentless average at best fool—if it weren’t for them. They saved what little spark I had in me. I still keep in touch with them. 

I love art, and I was an assistant for many years when I decided to combine the two. I love interacting with you guys. I love teaching you guys. But I’m gone from home 10 hours a day (add to that the time it takes to get ready and wind down) and just have a bunch of bullshit to do in the background. I’m being observed weekly (she’s just a coach and doesn’t report to my boss but it’s stressful and takes away from my prep time) and I also have to go through two years of an induction program after having graduated and my mentor is having us do some “co teaching” hoop of fire crap right now. My assistant principal wants me to participate in this district wide art show. I can never get it all done, I don’t want to burn out—so I rest. I won’t die over this job. 

I always score best in student relationships. I think I would make my old teachers proud. I have juniors lamenting that next year they will miss me. A whole year from now! I’m also a first year teacher at this school. 

The teaching portion of teaching accounts for like 30% of all my input energy into this job. It’s the time I enjoy the most. Everything else is overkill and I’m not even a core subjects teacher. If I didn’t love art I don’t think I could teach. I love the moment when I kid “gets” something difficult (Adobe programs are hard) and high fives me. I love telling a kid going through something rough (not like, mandated reporter rough) that it’s going to be okay. 

So back to my point. Everyone says you’re not doing enough. You’re not reading at grade level. You’re not mathing at the math level you should be. I suggest you do learn proper grammar and certain careers most definitely require math but I have never used anything I’ve learned in HS math since. I love numbers too. But, on my own terms. 

You’re not going to be able to function in this current society. But you know what?  Our current society is fucked. So, good!  *Dont’t succumb to functioning in this society.* I actually hope that society will have to succumb to you and the new way in which you all work. I use to sit in elementary school angry that I was wasting the best years of my life locked in a school. Now I’m spending my mid-life locked inside of a school. I didn’t decide on this job because of the money. I’m a silly dreamer artist person that needs fulfillment in order to work and be another gear in this capitalist bullshit machine. But I’ve lost my angst. I have no more fucks to give. If this job stresses me out too much I’ll dump it and do something soul sucking as long as it’s clock in and clock out/leave work at work. I want to enjoy what little time I have on this floating rock. 

I hope you’re the generation that changes this shit. I tell my students that they would learn so much better if they only had to be in school 20 hours a week. I’d be a more effective teacher because I’d still be working 40, just not 60-80. Only half of my work hours are actually spent at work, the other half is done when I’m “off the clock”.  Don’t worry if you’re not where you need to be or “whatever.”  I have students with learning disabilities running successful small businesses. Who gives a F. School was created for the “average” student, but the addition and division of you all into an average doesn’t represent a single one of you. I read an analogy about education being like a helicopter designed for the average person but there wasn’t anyone that could fly it because just because something is the average doesn’t mean it’s actually representative of the individual. 

Please try on your tests. Especially if you like your math and English teachers. Data is “so important.” Their success at work is dependent on it. I feel like many of our students know the answers but in comparison to TikTok—yeah, a standardized test is going to be boring. But the bullet. Your school gets (or doesn’t get) funding according to these bullshit ass tests. 

Anyway. My point is that I don’t think you’ll be able to function in this society. Which is great. Because this society sucks balls. I’m willing to bet a good portion of your teachers think so too. For God’s sake we hold several degrees but people think we are indoctrinating you to be gay furries using cat litter (this came to my attention today and what the actual fuck?). Society thinks we are turning you all gay because this generation has the cajones to be out and proud and we are generally more supportive (I’m super supportive!) that must mean that we are teaching you to be gay!  It feels like society is laughing at us, and like y’all (30% I’d say) are laughing at us too. That’s why the “good” teachers leave. I hope you create work reform so we don’t have to work 60 hours a week and still be unable to live independently (I don’t want to get married. I want to live alone damn it and I’ve worked hard enough to deserve it). 

I don’t know what the point of this is anymore. Don’t lose your angst. Don’t forget that things are shitty. You know in history learning about serfs working for the king and thinking “that’s so fucked.” (Maybe? That’s what I thought). We are the modern day serfs. People don’t want you to know that. So they’ll bombard news outlets with crap about things like TikTok being banned so we forget that Palestinians are still being slaughtered 5 months later. "
1bsdtyl,250,2024-03-31,(RANT) The Real Problem with Holy Grail: A Repository of Academic Resources for Students,u/cowbaecowboo,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/1bsdtyl/rant_the_real_problem_with_holy_grail_a/,"Listen up, folks, because I'm about to dissect a phenomenon that's been plaguing Singaporean students for years: the relentless pressure cooker that is junior college, polytechnic and university admissions. And while we're quick to point fingers at various culprits, there's one player that often slips under the radar: Holy Grail.

Now, before you jump to conclusions, hear me out. I'm not saying Holy Grail is solely to blame for the skyrocketing minimum cut-off requirements. No, it's just one large piece of the puzzle. You see, Holy Grail has made it easier for students to access top-notch study materials from elite schools. And while that's great for leveling the playing field, it's also led to more students achieving higher grades.

But here's the kicker: higher grades don't necessarily mean a better education system. In fact, they often translate to more stress and pressure for students, since there are a limited number of spaces available in different courses or streams. This makes it difficult for students who want to enter select highly-prized courses. Suddenly, getting a H2 A isn't enough – you need a H2 A with H3 Merit just to stay competitive. You thought your raw L1R5 8 nett L1R5 4 Singaporean citizenship was enough to get you into Waffles Institution's Science stream so that you could take H2 Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics and Economics and apply to Medicine, Dentistry, Law, followed by Computer Science? Think again. And who benefits from this vicious cycle? Certainly not the students.

And let's not forget the unintended consequences of Holy Grail's free access to elite schools' papers. While it's fantastic to have a wealth of resources at our fingertips, it also diminishes the value of learning. When everything is handed to you on a silver platter, where's the challenge? Where's the growth? 

So, what's the solution? Should we boycott Holy Grail? After all, students from Yishun Innova Junior College can now attain 90RP. Although our dear ex-Deputy Prime Minister, Heng Swee Keat, once said that ""Every School, A Good School"", clearly some schools are ""more good"" than others if people keep demanding for Waffles and China school's notes and not clamoring for a certain three-year Junior College experience's notes. Ultimately, it's not about pointing fingers or assigning blame. Instead, it's about recognizing the role Holy Grail plays in our academic landscape and using it to our advantage. Let's leverage these resources to enhance our understanding, rather than just chasing after grades.

**And with that said, I encourage each and every one of you to click on** **Holy Grail's links below**. Explore its offerings, use its haven of resources, contribute your own resources too, but do so with a critical eye. Remember, education is about more than just grades – it's about curiosity, creativity, and critical thinking.

Together, let's navigate the challenges of our education system with resilience and determination. We've got this.
