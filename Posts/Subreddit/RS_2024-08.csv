Gearing up for the next semester and wanna make a real difference, here’s the scoop from a fellow student who’s not lost his sanity (yet)  
  
**Know Your Why**: Studying without a goal is like wandering in the desert without water. Aim for that 4.0 GPA, or at least not falling asleep in lectures. Goals, people!

**Play Favorites**: All assignments aren’t created equal. Some are like gold, others like dust. Focus on the big fish that’ll boost your learning and grades. 🎯

**Tiny Bites**: Got a mammoth task? Slice it like pizza. More slices = more yum. Plan it out. You can't devour an XL pizza in one sitting, right? 🍕✂️

**Get Involved**: Don’t just read; chat, debate, or pretend you’re on a quiz show. Rubber duck method, baby. Teach someone, even if it’s your dog. 🦆

**Be the Clock’s BFF**: Pick study hours and stick to them like glue on glitter. Pomodoro technique is the secret sauce. ⏰🍅

**Brains Need TLC**: Sleep, snack smart, move a bit. Treat your brain like the royalty it is. 🛌🥑🏋️‍♂️

**Tech-Up**: Use tools like Perplexity, ChatGPT, [~Penseum~](https://www.penseum.com/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=post), etc., to pimp your study setup. 🚀📱

**Class Isn’t Just Attendance**: Show up, ask questions, act like Sherlock. 🕵️‍♂️🔍

**Study Squads**: Team up. Two heads (or more) are better than one and way more fun! 👯‍♂️

**Ask, Don’t Stash**: Stuck? Shout out. Professors, mates, the uni cat – someone knows the answer. 🙋‍♀️🐱

Remember, every setback’s just a setup for a comeback. Let’s crush this semester together! Hope this helps! 🎓🚀

Feel free to add your own tips and share the love. Let’s ace this! 💪💥"

Data Science grad student here, looking for some ideas for my capstone project. I'm aiming to work on something in the LLM space that combines both research and implementation. The project will span my final semester, so I've got a decent chunk of time to dive deep.

Some quick details:

* Timeline: One semester (about 3-4 months)
* Focus: Large Language Models
* Goal: Balance between research and practical implementation

I'm pretty comfortable with the usual ML/DL stack, but I'm open to learning new tools if needed.

Any suggestions for interesting problems or areas to explore?

If you've come across any cool papers or projects lately that could be extended, I'd love to hear about those too.

Thanks in advance for any input!"

Compared to say, 20 years ago if you remember or can go back that far, do you think there is less reading now required in college courses? Aside from the tech factor, what are some of the biggest differences you notice between course requirements now and back then? 

I teach Math courses as an adjunct since I also have another job, but I love teaching on the side and have been doing this for more than 15 years. One thing I have noticed is that a lot of the teaching has gotten to the point (speaking only for Math as I do not know what's happening in other courses to compare) where there is rampant cheating. Students just plug in the problem on AI and even students who would normally get an F, are now getting perfect scores on hw assignments if they use some program like ALEKS or Cengage. I am growing frustrated with this because I have a feeling that more and more of this is becoming pointless....like why teach complex procedures if you can just plug it into Chatgpt and solve? Chatgpt is getting better and better at even pretty ""tough"" Math word problems, unfortunately. Anyway I digress...I'd be curious to read your thoughts. "
1ejx5qa,128,2024-08-04,WSJ:  There’s a Tool to Catch Students Cheating With ChatGPT. OpenAI Hasn’t Released It.,u/anxman,singularity,https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1ejx5qa/wsj_theres_a_tool_to_catch_students_cheating_with/,"[https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openai-tool-chatgpt-cheating-writing-135b755a](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openai-tool-chatgpt-cheating-writing-135b755a)

Hi folks, longtime lurker / never poster.  I felt like this would be important for this audience.  I realize it's behind a paywall so I'm hoping someone can help post a ""full"" article.  I'm going to quote some of the parts that stood out to me regarding AI safety:

---

""OpenAI has a method to reliably detect when someone uses ChatGPT to write an essay or research paper. The company hasn’t released it despite widespread concerns about students [using artificial intelligence to cheat](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/teachers-ai-classroom-schools-678d7d84?mod=article_inline)**.** 

The project has been mired in internal debate at OpenAI for roughly two years and has been ready to be released for about a year, according to people familiar with the matter and internal documents viewed by The Wall Street Journal. “It’s just a matter of pressing a button,” one of the people said.

In trying to decide what to do, OpenAI employees have wavered between the startup’s stated commitment to transparency and their desire [to attract and retain users](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/chatgpt-maker-goes-smaller-and-cheaper-with-new-ai-tech-0cbcff84?mod=article_inline). One survey the company conducted of loyal ChatGPT users found nearly a third would be turned off by the anticheating technology.

An OpenAI spokeswoman said the company is concerned the tool could disproportionately affect groups such as non-native English speakers. “The text watermarking method we’re developing is technically promising but has important risks we’re weighing while we research alternatives,” she said. “We believe the deliberate approach we’ve taken is necessary given the complexities involved and its likely impact on the broader ecosystem beyond OpenAI.”

Employees who support the tool’s release, including those who helped develop it, have said internally those arguments pale compared with the good such technology could do. ""

""ChatGPT is powered by an AI system that predicts what word or word fragment, known as a token, should come next in a sentence. The anticheating tool under discussion at OpenAI would slightly change how the tokens are selected. Those changes would leave a pattern called a watermark. 

The watermarks would be unnoticeable to the human eye but could be found with OpenAI’s detection technology. The detector provides a score of how likely the entire document or a portion of it was written by ChatGPT. 

The watermarks are 99.9% effective when enough new text is created by ChatGPT, according to the internal documents. ""

"" ... **OpenAI surveyed ChatGPT users and found 69% believe cheating detection technology would lead to false accusations of using AI. Nearly 30% said they would use ChatGPT less if it deployed watermarks and a rival didn’t.**

**A recurring internal concern has been that the anticheating tool could hurt the quality of ChatGPT’s writing. OpenAI conducted a test earlier this year that found watermarking didn’t impair ChatGPT’s performance, people familiar with the matter said.**

**“Our ability to defend our lack of text watermarking is weak now that we know it doesn’t degrade outputs,” employees involved in the testing concluded, according to the internal documents.** 

In early June, OpenAI senior employees and researchers met again to discuss the project. The group agreed the watermarking technology worked well, but the results of the ChatGPT user survey from last year still loomed large. Staffers said the company should look into other approaches that were potentially less controversial among users but unproven, according to people with knowledge of the meeting.

They also said OpenAI needed a plan by this fall to sway public opinion around AI transparency as well as potential new laws on the subject, the internal documents show. 

“Without this, we risk credibility as responsible actors,” a summary of the June meeting said."""
1ek7utr,2,2024-08-04,Teaching an App Development Course - Advice Needed,u/Brilliant-Thought864,AskProgramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/1ek7utr/teaching_an_app_development_course_advice_needed/,"Hi everyone. I have been building my Software agency (with only myself) and have gotten 2 clients so far. It is my primary school and my a local community Centre in milton. Essentially I specialize in building Mobile Apps for schools and community centers which helps them communicate with their members and send updates regarding events. However, since these were my first clients, I am not getting paid much (bascially doing it for free).

So ***I wanted to design a summer workshop where i teach people about App Development.*** No prior coding knowledge will be needed for this. And here are somethings I wanted to ask for help.

**1. What demographic should I focus on?** I was planning to target High School Students who can create these apps to put on their college applications or resumes. I was thinking of targeting University Students with a similar selling point. On the other hand, I was thinking of keeping it open to anyone who wants to experience building an app of their own. We will be using rapid code tools like FlutterFlow to give them an introduction of App Development.

**2. What would be a great project / app idea to build with beginners?** Essentially I was aiming to make the course project based. I want to teach them basics while helping them build an app that they can use. I was thinking of building like a Family App to make grocery list, plan events or put updates. But thought this might become complex. I was also thinking of maybe just building an app that wraps Gemini as an AI app based project. Essentially I want to make something valuable with the students so they can be proud of what they have made. I didn't want to do the To Do List app because there are tons of videos online about that. What would be some cool and simple apps that you'd like to build?

**3. How long should the entire course be?** I was planning to have synchronous classes live online. And was planning each class to be about 2 hrs. I was planning to make the course have 6 classes in total so (12hrs of teaching). Maybe the length of the course would also depend on the the project and demographic. But I want to finish the course within August.

**4. How much should I price the course?** The big question. I was planning to charge about $99/student. They would get 12 hrs of live lectures and have the opportunity to book extra QA sessions (like office hours) if they have any confusion with that price. Again, I want to help them build something of value and have fun.

**5. If I were to market the course, where would be greate spot?** Also what would be a great way to market the course? Flyers, or FB ads or something else?

**5 Anything else?** Is there anything else I must be careful of? I am new to designing a course and teaching it myself online, but I am well versed with App Development and public speaking. Is there any other input anyone has?

Thank you!"

1el03u6,21,2024-08-05,Can chatGPT be a custom trained AI advisor for a course (details inside)?,u/Okumam,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1el03u6/can_chatgpt_be_a_custom_trained_ai_advisor_for_a/,"I teach college courses.  In each course, we have a bunch of course related material- learning resources, tips, guides, examples, warnings about common mistakes and so on.  It's not a lot of material (not like a book), but still a decent amount and highly relevant.

So the question is this:  would it be possible to ""train"" the AI on that material, then somehow share it with the students in that course, so that when a student has a question about some course content, the AI answers partially based on the source material that was shared?  Or, for example, when they have to do a discussion post, they ask the AI if it looks good, and the AI tells them that it fits or does not fit the guidelines/warnings/previous examples that were in the course materials.

So basically my question is in two parts: can the AI be trained to use those materials, and then can that be shared with the students somehow?  Is this what the customGPTs are?  Are they free to share afterwards?

I know there are things like google notebook and nvidia's chat that can train on your files, but I don't think they can be easily shared with others afterwards.  Can this be done with ChatGPT?  If it can, Will it require an investment by the school to be able to be shared with the students (It could be a trained AI shared for each course, or maybe a much larger, ""combined"" single AI that has all the courses in it)?"

I’ve been working on a new app concept that I think could revolutionize how we interact with large language models (LLMs) and manage complex discussions. I’d love to get your feedback and insights on it! 🙌



**🎯 What is it?**

Imagine a node-based interface where each conversation can branch into different threads or nodes. Each node retains the context of the main discussion but focuses on a specific subtopic. This structure is designed to help users manage complex projects, brainstorm ideas, and collaborate more effectively.

  
**🚧 Challenges with Current Interfaces:**

When using current LLM conversational interfaces, I’ve noticed a few significant challenges. Tracking and revisiting previous topics in a linear sequence is cumbersome, making it hard to organize and connect information meaningfully. The sheer volume of information generated can be overwhelming, leading to cognitive overload. As I explore multiple topics, the interface can quickly become visually cluttered, making it difficult to understand the relationships between different discussions.

# 🕵️‍♂️ OpenAI has a secretive tool to detect AI-generated text

OpenAI has been sitting on a tool that can detect AI-assisted cheating for nearly a year. Using an invisible watermarking technique, the company has developed a tool that can detect ChatGPT-generated text with 99.9% accuracy. However, internal debates about user retention, potential bias, and distribution methods have kept this technology under wraps.

Meanwhile, educators are desperately seeking ways to detect AI misuse in schools. A recent survey found that 59% of middle- and high-school teachers were confident some students had used AI for schoolwork, up 17 points from the previous year.

***Why does it matter?***

This tool could preserve the value of original thought in education. However, OpenAI's hesitation shows there are complex ethical considerations about AI detection and unintended consequences in language communities.

# 🦾OpenAI co-founder leaves for Anthropic

https://preview.redd.it/lpd083gu54hd1.png?width=1118&format=png&auto=webp&s=54d1c98e8360bfc77aeb4c4c58e7e55719575321

Three key leaders at OpenAI are departing or taking leave, including co-founder John Schulman, co-founder Greg Brockman, and Peter Deng — another major shakeup for the AI powerhouse.

* John Schulman, co-founder and a key leader at OpenAI, has left to join rival AI startup Anthropic — one of OpenAI’s biggest competitors.
* Greg Brockman, OpenAI's president and co-founder, is taking an extended leave of absence until the end of the year.
* Peter Deng, a product leader who joined last year from Meta, has reportedly also departed.
* These moves follow other recent high-profile exits, including co-founders Ilya Sutskever and Andrej Karpathy.

OpenAI has struggled to regain its footing after Sam Altman's departure and eventual return as CEO in November 2023. Brockman, one of Altman's biggest supporters during the ousting, mysteriously takes a leave of absence at a crucial time as OpenAI sees increased competition from Anthropic and Meta AI.

# 🧠 AI turns brain cancer cells into immune cells

Researchers at the Keck School of Medicine of USC used AI to reprogram glioblastoma cells into cancer-fighting dendritic cells. It increased survival chances by up to 75% in mouse models of glioblastoma, the deadliest form of brain cancer in adults. The technique cleverly bypasses the blood-brain barrier by converting cancer cells within the tumor itself, a major hurdle in traditional glioblastoma treatments.

The approach greatly improved survival rates in animal models when combined with existing treatments like immune checkpoint therapy or DC vaccines. The research team aims to begin clinical trials in patients within the next few years

***Why does it matter?***

The technique offers new hope for patients facing this aggressive disease. Moreover, the approach's application to other cancer types suggests a broader impact on cancer immunotherapy, transforming how we approach cancer treatment in the future.

I helped with her assignments before, part of which is kasi nahuli siya ng teacher niya na ChatGPT lang yung mga tasks niya. Sinabi ko naman na tutulungan ko siya for now, since I have a lot of time before I go to uni. Nakakainis lang sa part na I have to spoonfed her the answers all the time, parang wala na rin siyang gana mag-aral at all. Worse, hindi siya marunong mag-add! Add na hindi rin siya gumamit ng Word / Google Docs napapakamot na lang talaga ako kung paano niya nalagpasan yung Elem niya nung pandemic. Oh, did I mention na With Honors siya last year? This is ridiculous! Ganto na ba kababa ang standard ng some schools ngayon or hindi lang sila nagfofocus sa natututunan ng mga estudyante nila? 

Bulakbol din naman ako nung bata ako, but not to the point na hindi ko kaya hanapin sa YouTube yung problema ko.

Its 24/7 availability ensures that training sessions can be accessed at any time, thereby accommodating diverse schedules and work environments. This flexibility leads to better resource management and a decrease in training costs.

Educational institutions can also harness the power of ChatGPT to supplement classroom teaching. By integrating ChatGPT into their learning management systems, they can offer students additional support with homework, clarify complex topics through interactive discussions, and foster a deeper understanding of the subject matter. ChatGPT can also serve as a tool for language learning, directly conversing with students in the target language, thus providing immersive and practical language practice.

Furthermore, the use of ChatGPT in virtual learning environments facilitates personalized feedback and grading, allowing educators to devote more time to curriculum development and one-on-one student mentoring. This greatly enhances the overall educational experience.

However, as we embrace ChatGPT in learning and development, it's essential to address potential challenges such as ensuring the AI's responses are accurate and unbiased, maintaining engagement in the absence of human interaction, and protecting user data.

I'm a researcher working on large language models (LLMs) and techniques like fine-tuning to improve their performance on downstream tasks for non-computer science domain. While transformers have revolutionized NLP with their self-attention mechanisms, I find myself facing a different kind of attention challenge: effectively communicating these complex ML concepts to non-technical stakeholders, such as:

* Funding agencies and grant committees 
* Students in introductory AI/ML courses
* Business leaders and product managers

I'm looking for great examples of visualizations, animations, analogies, etc. that help explain things like:

* What LLMs are and how they work at a high-level
* The impact of fine-tuning on LLM performance 
* Improvements achieved by fine-tuning for specific applications

The goal is to create compelling materials for funding proposals, lectures, and other situations where I need to direct audience attention and convey the core concepts to those without ML expertise.

If you've come across any projects, blog posts, videos, or papers that do this well, please share them! I'd really appreciate learning from the examples and techniques others have developed. Links to repos with code for generating visualizations would also be fantastic.

Thanks in advance for any guidance and pointers! Let me know if any other details would be helpful."

* Reddit CEO Steve Huffman announced plans to test AI-powered search results later this year, aiming to help users explore products, shows, games, and new communities on the platform.
* Huffman indicated that the company might explore monetizing through paywalled subreddits, which could offer exclusive content or private areas while still maintaining the traditional free version of Reddit.
* As Reddit seeks to diversify revenue sources, Huffman emphasized that the company has blocked certain entities from accessing Reddit content to ensure transparency and protect user privacy.

# 🤖 Robot dentist performs first automated procedure

* A Boston-based tech company, backed by Mark Zuckerberg’s dentist father, completed the world’s first all-robotic dental procedure, marking a significant advancement in medical technology.
* The robot, operated by Perceptive, independently performed a process called ""cutting,"" which involves drilling into and shaving down a tooth, demonstrating its capabilities in Barranquilla, Colombia.
* This breakthrough aims to use autonomous machines for procedures like crown placements in as little as 15 minutes, enhancing precision, efficiency, and patient care.

OpenAI-backed startup Figure AI just showed off Figure 02, its next-generation AI-powered humanoid robot — capable of completely autonomous work in complex environments like a BMW factory.

* Figure 02 uses OpenAI’s AI models for speech-to-speech reasoning, allowing the humanoid robot to have full conversations with humans.
* A Vision Language Model (VLM) enables the robot to make quick, common-sense decisions based on visual input and self-correct errors.
* Six RGB cameras provide the robot with 360-degree vision to help it navigate the real world.
* The robot stands 5'6""and weighs 132 lbs, with a 44 lb lifting capacity and a 20-hour runtime thanks to a custom 2.25 KWh battery pack.

The humanoid robot race is intensifying, with Figure CEO Brett Adcock claiming that Figure 02 is now the “most advanced humanoid on the planet"" — a direct challenge toward Elon Musk and Tesla Optimus. While the world now waits for Elon’s response, Figure has one ace up its sleeve: its OpenAI partnership.

ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, just launched Jimeng AI for Chinese users, a text-to-video AI app that directly competes with OpenAI’s (unreleased) Sora AI video model.

* Jimeng AI is available on the Apple App Store and Android for Chinese users.
* ByteDance's entry into the AI video generation market follows similar launches by other Chinese tech firms, including Kuaishou's Kling AI.
* The subscription, priced at 79 yuan ($11) monthly or 659 yuan ($92) annually allows for the creation of \~2,050 images or 168 AI videos per month.
* Unlike OpenAI's Sora, which isn't yet publicly available, these models by Jimeng AI are already accessible to users (in China).

China's AI video generation race is accelerating, with Kling AI's public release just weeks ago and now ByteDance's Jimeng AI launching while the world anxiously waits for Sora's public release. With Jimeng AI being backed by TikTok, it will have plenty of training data and deep pockets to compete against other AI giants.

# 🧪 New AI can listen while speaking

https://preview.redd.it/dulcm59smahd1.png?width=1292&format=png&auto=webp&s=f54d32c45ba93d9c18ec3f1001a2727f42ed37f4

AI researchers just developed a new Listening-While-Speaking Language Model (LSLM) that can listen and speak simultaneously — advancing real-time, interactive speech-based AI conversations.

* The new model, called the Listening-while-Speaking Language Model (LSLM), enables full-duplex modeling in interactive speech-language models.
* LSLM uses a token-based decoder-only TTS for speech generation and a streaming self-supervised learning encoder for real-time audio input.
* The system can detect turn-taking in real-time and respond to interruptions, a key feature of natural conversation.
* The model demonstrated robustness to noise and sensitivity to diverse instructions in experiments.

While OpenAI's recent Her-like [advanced voice mode](https://www.therundown.ai/p/openai-begins-chatgpt-voice-rollout?) for ChatGPT inches us toward realistic AI conversations, LSLM leaps even further by enabling AI to process incoming speech WHILE talking. This could revolutionize human-AI interactions — making conversations with machines feel truly natural and responsive.

I’m choosing what else to pursue, and I do genuinely have an interest in so many of these fields. My goal is to go to a top grad school for my masters and I’m leaning towards a Machine Learning focus. With that being said, here’ are my ideas:



**Just CS, graduate in 3 years**, at my current school money isn’t really an issue so don’t worry about that, my CS program and my specializiation covers various core topics, some low-level compilers and OS stuff, plus various Machine learning specialized topics.



**CS + Data sci/Math**, this would give me a bit of extra math background (although CS already has quite a bit) which may prove useful and look good for grad applications?, although I’ve also heard some cases of people not really having that background being completely fine since they must take those classes in grad school anyways.



**CS+Finance/Economics/Entrepeneurship**, my goal after working in a company as a Software or Machine Learning Engineer for some time is to start my own startup at some point, but realistically you don’t need a degree for that, still, would these help perhaps with showing I have more of an applicable interest or something for potential admissions reviews?



**CS + Robotics/mechanical Engineering/physics, etc**. this would have me learning a bit more of the hardware/low-level physical side of the field, which could be advantageous if I pursue more physical Machine Learning and software engineering roles related to these, but how would that look for grad school applications in particular having that reach?



**CS+linguistics**, to be honest most of the linguistics stuff is kind of unrelated to what I’d be doing in machine learning even with natural language processing and things like ChatGPT, but having that extra knowledge may prove useful for showing my interest in the field and at least make people thing that I’d be useful for having that reserve knowledge on standby for whatever reason while working on natural language processing. Thoughts on this for grad school applications?



**CS+leadership/project management**, this could be useful since many software engineers (SWEs) typically move into more of manager roles as they get into more senior positions. The thing is though it may have some benefits, most people don’t need this background to do that though but still, how would that affect grad school apps?



**CS+medical engineering branch**, this is similar to the CS+robotics point I made, except with a focus on medical tech. 



**CS+something creative like communications or creative writing** for the creativity and outreach aspect



**CS+full on biology or chemistry** similar to medical engineering but also showing my STEM commitment haha.



**CS+something really opposite it like African american studies, sociology, anthropology, history**. Technically there are applications like with mapping geospatial data and such which I could lean into, but would the quirkiness make it seem better as if I’m more well-rounded per se.



**CS+language like Chinese, Greek, etc**. not much use except that people may like having multilingual applicants to connect better with diverse teams and potential customers (don’t know how much my role would lead to me interacting with them though), grad schools might think I’m more well-rounded.



**CS+a politics/foreign policy branch**



**CS+Enviornmental science** (some use cases to appeal to for grad apps and they might like that broadness)



**CS+Geospatial sciences**, the more direct use-case version of CS+Sociology and related fields, although with CS+Sociology it could seem more like that I have the base knowledge in the two fields ready to combine rather than a shallow overview and combined version I get purely from the Geospatial.



**CS+education, or nutrition**, things I’m interested in but extremely unrelated to what I’d do, just to show off that i’m truly interested in life beyond comp sci and well-rounded per se though?



**CS+metereology**, similar to the above, except some peculiar use cases, perhaps this would be a good way to appeal my uniqueness to the grad admissions?

  






I do know things like projects, resumes, experience, extracurriculars, GPAs, GRE (for CS students does this matter, perhaps at top schools?) matter a lot more, but I still would like to know if these may make a difference

  
**TLDR Would choosing a quirkier minor/second major (that I am genuinely interested in and can tie that interest into Comp Sci for some of these cases) make much of a difference in grad apps?**"

1emxq0t,1,2024-08-08,Does Sapling’s AI Detector Work?,u/gptgabe,stealthgpt,https://www.reddit.com/r/stealthgpt/comments/1emxq0t/does_saplings_ai_detector_work/,"Read the Original Post here: [https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/does-sapling-s-ai-detector-work](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/does-sapling-s-ai-detector-work)

The world of AI writing requires two fields of knowledge: AI-generated text and AI detection tools. Having gushed over StealthGPT as the best AI in the undetectable space, I now have to put our tech to the test against today’s leading AI content detectors.

Today’s review is not for testing against one of those leading AI content detectors like Turnitin, though. It’s for the free version of [Sapling.AI](http://Sapling.AI), which is not just an AI content detector but an AI writing assistant too. So, if Sapling can't detect it, at least it can proofread your work with a grammar checker and autocomplete feature to boot.

# My Grading System

Since Detectors are used by professors and students, I'm going to use an academic model: A,B,C,D,F.

I'm also going to grade for three different categories: Functionality, User Experience, and Pricing. Once I arrive at a letter-grade for each, I'll take the average as the overall grade.

# A First Glance At Sapling AI

Reviewers and academics alike use free detectors when they need a quick fix to rule whether the text in question is legit. Let's see if this Sapling AI Detector fixes anything though.

Mmmmkay....First thing I notice is the rather plain and flat website. It gives me the impression the software is a bit janky but only a test run will tell. At the top, the site goes over the basics of AI writing and AI detection tools. Then scrolling down we see the instructions at the bottom:

What distinguishes Sapling.ai’s free version from the paid version seems to be character limits. The free version allows for only 2,000 characters, but if you sign up for a free trial, you can get the Pro Plan for 30 days. Here’s a screenshot of their pricing if you’re interested:

The pro plan also includes more advanced edits and autocomplete, which is basically proofreading software that autocompletes sentences and acts as a grammar checker. You have to input snippets and mappings for the software to handle the text to your liking which is a very complex process that seems to inhibit free writing for me, rather than enhance it.

The transparency of the site is refreshing though. They aren’t trying to hide that AI detectors come up with false positives and aren’t a perfect method to judge whether any text is AI-generated. Let's see if those warnings are there just to prepare you for their results.

Now that I’m in my account, having set up the free trial of their pro plan, the user interface doesn’t seem too friendly or convenient. I watched their tutorial about using their AI writing assistant, but have no direction where to find their AI detector from my account.

# Testing Against ChatGPT

Does ChatGPT’s language model have what it takes to write an essay that can bypass Sapling.AI?

At first, the AI detector tool didn’t make it clear if I could simply copy and paste my AI-generated text into the dialogue box. I gave it a go anyway, hoping I wouldn’t have to upload a file and it worked. Sadly, it still gave me an error. As you can see here:

So, off to upload our ChatGPT essay, we go:

Ladies and gentlemen, we got detected. 100% too! That’s pretty impressive. It may not be the most convenient interface but [Sapling.AI](http://Sapling.AI) gets points in basic functionality.

# Testing Against StealthGPT

First, let's humanize ChatGPT's text with StealthGPT’s AI Humanizer:

Now, lets try [Sapling.AI](http://Sapling.AI) against our Undetectable AI writing tool:

Damn, only 5.7% fake. [Sapling.AI](http://Sapling.AI) just got WRECKED! Unbelievable. I bet it doesn’t fair well against other undetectable AI writing tools either.

Here's text humanized Undetectable. AI in the first screenshot then in the 2nd screenshot, we see the outcome of that text going up against Sapling.AI:

Wow. 100% fake. I love Sapling.AI! If you're using Undetectableai, you might as well be using ChatGPT. Same result.

If you want to learn more about [How to Bypass AI Detectors](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/bypassing-ai-detectors-stealthgpt), our guide is essential reading.

# Testing Against Human Writing

Lastly, I want to test [Sapling.AI](http://Sapling.AI) against my own human writing. I swear if my text gets a higher fakeness score than StealthGPT’s I'm gonna send a scathing email.

Here’s a reading of my last blog post entitled [Can I Get Free Unlimited Undetectable AI?](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/can-i-get-free-unlimited-undetectable-ai) The answer to which is yes and I can guarantee our free version is has more functionality than Sapling.AI’s. Okay, here goes nothing:

Well, I guess I prefer an error to being called fake.

# Final Grade

Functionality: It was able to detect ChatGPT and Undetectable AI by 100%. On the other hand, I got error messages so frequently that after reading 'unexpected error. Contact support.' on the website numerous times, I just need to warn you, that you can expect errors. It also couldn't detect StealthGPT, so I'm going to give the functionality grade a C.

User Experience: The Website is flat and difficult to navigate. if you sign up for the pro plan you kinda have no idea what to do next from the account page. There isn't a tab or anything to use the detector, I had to go back and google it. F.

Price: Free version that allows a 5,000 character limit and a thirty-day free trial? That's pretty snazzy. I wouldn't use it myself but it's free so who cares if it does anything well? B!

**Overall Grade: C-**

# Conclusion

Does [Sapling.AI](http://Sapling.AI) work? Eh, kinda. The user interface is clunky. The dual AI detection service and AI writing assistant tool makes things more confusing, especially if you just want the detector.

If you actually want an AI writing assistant, and your phone’s autocorrect doesn’t cause enough of a headache for you, then perhaps the grammar checker and autocomplete features here are for you. Having built in Chrome extensions for the AI detector and writing assistant might prove to be useful in some cases though.

Overall, If I had to grade my customer satisfaction with Sapling intelligence, I’d give it a C-. Maybe there’s potential there. It did flag ChatGPT and Undetectable AI, after all. There were so many errors both while copy and pasting as well as uploading Microsoft Word docs, that if I went ahead and contacted customer support, I’d be writing essay-length complaints.

Or maybe I’ll just have StealthGPT write those emails, it’s not like [Sapling.AI](http://Sapling.AI) would know, right?

# FAQ

# What Are AI Detection Tools?

AI Detection tools analyze any piece of text for the watermarks of AI-generated content which may include imagined facts and references and over-simplified word choice and sentences. Some popular AI Detection Tools include Turnitin, GPT4, GPTZero, Copyleaks, [Originality.AI](http://Originality.AI), and more.

# What is Undetectable AI?

Undetectable AI services humanize AI-generated text using a natural language processor that allows it to give any writing a human touch. It makes the word choice and sentence structure more random, like the way human’s naturally write.

# Is Using ChatGPT Plagiarism?

No. ChatGPT, or any AI writing tools create original text. Plagiarism is the theft of someone else’s words or ideas without credit. If you use a text written by ChatGPT to hand in an essay, that’s not traditional plagiarism but what is now known as ""AI plagiarism"". You can read our breakdown on [plagiarism and the ethics of artificial intelligence in academia](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/is-using-chatgpt-plagiarism-academic-dishonesty-in-dishonest-academia) here.

# What Is The Best AI Detector to Use?

Turnitin is certainly the most popular. Their recent update thwarted the bypass efforts of all of StealthGPT’s competition. Our service was prepared though, and is still able to fly undetected by Turnitin. You can read all about [Turnitin’s recent update](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/turnitin-update-stealthgpt-bypasses-turnitin) as well as [StealthGPT’s update](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/stealthgpt-updates-july-2024) on our blog.

# What Is the Best AI to Generate Undetectable Text?

StealthGPT. Hands down. Disagree? Ask [Sapling.AI](http://Sapling.AI) which undetectable text just got flagged as 5% fake after they reviewed our work.

If you need undetectable AI-generated text for essays, articles, social media, content creation and more, look no further than StealthGPT. Our software is available in English but we also have language models for every major language around the world."

Both parents went there, made lifelong friends, had the best times of their lives, and gained many impactful connections because of this school. Fast forward to my freshman year of high school, I was turned on by the fact that my college guidance counselor doubted my ability to get into $%&. I completed only the bare minimum for every category of strength on my resume. I ensured I got a 90% or above on every course I took to get the best GPA and rank but my method of doing it was sleezy. Because my high school was new and small I was friends with almost all of my teachers who were more than willing to negotiate with me on getting scores better than I deserved. I procrastinated until the LAST second, I wasn't passionate about a single topic and I pretty much forgot about every important topic or piece of knowledge I learned. I only studied to ace an exam and not to actually learn or care. I abused AI so much that I aced two community college courses completely -to boost my class rank- using ChatGPT and none of my own words. I learned nothing except how to thoughtfully cheat. Not to mention the accommodations I absolutely abused even though I don't have an actual learning disability I'm aware of. Even the leadership aspect of my resume is BS: I was captain for three of our sports teams throughout the years including basketball, cross country, and ultimate frisbee. The only reason I was captain was because I'm 6'6"" and our school has no sports influence. Our teams were actual ass in all sports except ultimate. I was one of the student body co-presidents which is an anomaly only accepted by a tiny school and I only got elected through pure popularity. I didn't do a single productive thing during my time as the president. I sat there and watched my co (who is actually a genius) do everything for me. I was even elected as the president of the Habitat for Humanity Club, however, other than attracting more members and doing very little service work myself, I did nothing. Yet, I got into all five prestigious colleges I applied to and the National Honor Society. I'm sitting here now a week before I attend $%& not knowing a damn thing I learned in high school contemplating my life and how unfair it is to other people. About how I ranked no. 2 in my grade and didn't give a single shit. Not to mention, I'm an idiot with the IQ of an average truck driver who is terrible at math and wants to pursue computer science. It's a sad joke. My entire career is proof of how embarrassing the U.S.'s scholastic and education system is and now I don't know what to do."

1end9ym,1,2024-08-08,What aspiring economists aren’t being taught,u/Significant-Notice-,marginal,https://www.reddit.com/r/marginal/comments/1end9ym/what_aspiring_economists_arent_being_taught/,"From [Steve Landsburg in the WSJ](https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-aspiring-economists-arent-being-taught-a3f73484):

Here’s an economics brain teaser: Apples are provided by a competitive industry. Pears are provided by a monopolist. Coincidentally, they sell at the same price. You’re hungry and would be equally happy with an apple or a pear. If you care about conserving societal resources, which should you buy?

Most of my sophomore-level economics students can solve this problem, which I posed on an exam. Almost nobody else can. I’ve tried it out on a lot of smart lawyers, accountants, entrepreneurs and scientists. Neither can the latest version of ChatGPT.

First I’ll tell you the answer; then I’ll tell you the moral. In a competitive industry, prices are a pretty good indicator of resource costs. Under a monopoly, prices usually reflect a substantial markup. So a $1 apple sold by a competitor probably requires almost a dollar’s worth of resources to produce. A $1 pear sold by a monopolist is more likely to require, say, 80 cents worth of resources. To minimize resource consumption, you should buy the pear.

Agree or not?  The entire piece is of interest.  [Ben Golulb is upset](https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://x.com/ben_golub/status/1821214443629326564), but for an economist at Northwestern he doesn’t have much of an argument, as Robin Hanson [points out](https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://x.com/robinhanson/status/1821267222217556065).  Which is in fact the best argument against Landsburg’s claim?

AI audio models are now capable of describing and producing specific sounds, a significant development for creators working on multimedia projects. These models can generate sounds like police sirens paired with a burning building, enhancing the realism of the project. The interaction between large language models (LLMs) and voice interfaces is becoming more natural, resembling conversations with a person. This advancement is anticipated to lead to the development of a general AI audio model, offering further possibilities in audio production [1][3].







The a16z Podcast, produced by Andreessen Horowitz, provides insights into tech and culture trends, news, and the future. The podcast features industry experts, business leaders, and other voices from around the world, with multiple episodes released weekly [2][4].







Ian Webster, founder of PromptFoo, advocates for open source and transparency in addressing AI risk. He believes that allowing everyone who wants to help secure applications is the best way forward. This perspective was shared in a discussion between a16z General Partner Anjney Midha and Ian Webster on the importance of red-teaming for AI safety and security [5][6][7].







NVIDIA has developed the GenAI-Perf tool to measure and optimize generative AI model performance, specifically for LLMs. This tool provides metrics such as time to first token, output token throughput, and inter-token latency to help achieve optimal performance. It supports OpenAI-compatible APIs for evaluating model performance and facilitates standardized performance evaluation across different inference engines [8].







Groq Inc is hosting their first Denver-based hackathon, offering participants the chance to meet local Groqsters, get increased rates on Groq, and win prizes. In addition, Groq Inc has announced that they are now SOC 2 Type II compliant, demonstrating their commitment to upholding high standards of security and compliance [10][11].







The Interpretability team at Anthropic has shared their insights on the next five hurdles towards achieving a mechanistic understanding of neural networks in their latest research update. The team encourages treating the results as preliminary thoughts shared in a lab meeting rather than a mature paper [14].







NVIDIA is actively involved in the research and development of 6G technology, leveraging AI-native tools and collaborating with industry partners and organizations like the AI-RAN Alliance, 3GPP, and O-RAN. They are contributing to the development of AI/ML methodologies for the radio access network (RAN) and are working on AI-driven air interfaces, digital twin networks, and over-the-air (OTA) development platforms for 6G [15].







Yann LeCun acknowledges that many AI/ML/CV/NLP PhDs today, including his own students and those of Geoff and Yoshua, had a head start in deep learning in the 2000s when few others were working in the field. He identifies three great scientific questions: What's the universe made of? What's life all about? What is intelligence? He believes that answering the question about intelligence can only be achieved by creating intelligent machines [20][21][22][23].

I'm going into my third year of computer science. I feel like school is wasting my time. Although the things we learn seem useful, I find myself just trying to find shortcuts through ChatGPT for assignments and cramming for exams, memorizing ppt slides of relevant SW content but worth like 50 % of my grade. I don't do well in those. The way they test is so specific that little mistakes add up to a failing grade and I think that's quite literally the worst representation of my learning and applying it. So far, most of my courses have been like that. Assignments of mini-projects, quizzes, midterms...

Heck, we still need to learn Assembly and C and other bs that I don't feel like I need to spend $1000 on each course to forget like 2 weeks after the semester ends.

For context, my remaining courses include, database, networking, compiler design, server-side development, etc. Yes, I agree they are useful courses but the way they teach it is dump every info taken from a textbook or some Stanford/Berkeley CS course. Then again the cycle continues with exams (taking up like 70% of grade) with very specific info from lectures that I will forget. There is so useful aspects like application or project building! This stuff isn't even what I want to do in the field.

I suck at just memorizing and getting tested on it. I don't think the exams are useful at all.

The other thing is that I know what I want to do in the field, that is, either full-stack dev or machine learning (AI path). Both of those positions seem attainable without a degree. Should I really consider dropping out if I feel this way and I feel like I would benefit much better by learning useful topics online and going straight into application (projects)?

I'm so close to calling it quits in university but my only concern is jobs that require a bachelor's degree (still like 85%) of the industry.

Will I be set back from my classmates? Would it be easier or harder to get a job?

If I do drop out, I know I'll put 100% in my own learning and make sure I get stuff done.

Maybe I'm just a complainer and need to get my shit together. Thanks for reading this.

TLDR: 3rd year uni student, thinking cs degree in uni is useless content. want to dropout and self teach what I want to go into (frontend, backend, fullstack, machine learning). is it worth it?"
1epaxhv,265,2024-08-10,Got my A+ without buying anything in under a month,u/CraftWise5256,CompTIA,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/1epaxhv/got_my_a_without_buying_anything_in_under_a_month/,"As of this morning I have passed my 1102 exam with a score of 756 and i am officially  A+ certified. Combined with my 1101 I achieved my A+ in just under a month, about 2 weeks on each exam with a day off every Sunday. I know that people all throughout this subreddit are recommending certain people such as Messer practice test and this persons lecture videos, which is cool and all, only problem is I am a college student trying to graduate debt free. Aside from the fee of the actual exams I didn't buy anything from any source nor did I enroll in any comptia boot camp. No bought study guide, lessons,or practice exams, everything I studied with was free. 

Although I did watch the video series with professor Messer on youtube (WHICH IS FREE) I have the attention span of a toddler, I would watch for 5 minutes then zone out and Tiktok for 20 minutes. So although I watched the entire series on Messer I didn't really retain any information. (That's just me though, if you have a great attention span and are a visual learner Messer will be great). 

The way I studied was going on the exam objectives for both test. Copying and pasting each lesson (NOT CHAPTER) title into quizlet and studying off there while posting questions I has in ChatGPT. Yep, you read it right, my main source of information was quizlet and ChatGPT. A highly underrated tool I don't see a lot of people mention, but I believe that it goes more in depth than any video series. I especially think its better than buying a whole ass text book and reading for god know how many hours. I never was a fan of textbooks, quizlets tell you the main information that you need to know for the test. I feel like most textbook those in comptia and pretty much everywhere talk a whole lot of nonesense that you don't even need.

Usually theres a couple of good quizlet for every lesson. My suggestion would be to look for the ones that have reviews (which is usually the first 1-3 links shown). I usually memorized about 5 quizlets or 5 lessons a day until I finish. Then spend 2-3 reviewing everything and taking the test.  I made sure to find quizlets that had every topic listed in the lesson.

Additionally if I didn't know a topic or it wasn't explain correctly I used chat GPT to clarify. (Seriously if you need to know the difference of something o ask  for examples, or just clarifications,  Chat GPT is the way.)

And for practice questions I used only exam compass. Just google exam compass comptia A+ and it should show up. Identical questions to the exam if your consistently scoring 75+ you'll do fine.

Mind you I am a full time college student with a job. I work 3 12 hour shifts a week as an EMT and taking summer classes to finish off my minor prereqs.  

Please don't feel pressured to buy books or resources if you know your budget doesn't fit. I don't normally make post but I just want people to know that it is possible to not spend money and get the A+."

1eq26ag,3,2024-08-11,Help with Custom GPT for a College Advisor Bot,u/PhyschoPhilosopher,OpenAI,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1eq26ag/help_with_custom_gpt_for_a_college_advisor_bot/,"I'm working with my college on creating a custom GPT to help answer student's questions about courses and even possibly suggest schedules for them but it seems GPT keeps getting information about courses wrong. I'm not sure if there is maybe a better way to feed the information to GPT or if these problems are just the current state of GPT.

Originally all of the courses offered in this coming fall were in a somewhat sloppy Excel file so to make it easier for ChatGPT, I created a python script to extract all the information into sentences that look like this:

[text file containing every Fall Course](https://preview.redd.it/ynnapexa35id1.png?width=1115&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c9a5cec9677cf750a4bd852fe413244d8de017f)

The problem is that GPT seems to give the wrong information quite often. For example:

[Part of a suggested schedule](https://preview.redd.it/631j3edh45id1.png?width=645&format=png&auto=webp&s=7137061eba8ff64c5a6c7b054cdfe29c5ce674d2)

[Got this one right](https://preview.redd.it/owwxands35id1.png?width=1138&format=png&auto=webp&s=ca099a3268a7dd243f3aa22e13e5d4e99f690fd7)

[Got both the teacher and Times wrong](https://preview.redd.it/skzmb8cz35id1.png?width=1128&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7ee5443bfa4500da36489adb22f7af28e3ab25d)

It tends to get more wrong than right. Not to mention that for Web Application Development, it said it was taught by Campbell, however, there is no teacher named Campbell in the entire text file.

Note: There is also another text file that contains a planner for a Computer Science major which has a list of when to take certain classes, I'm including this just in case this might be causing any problems, although I doubt it.

1eqm0lr,111,2024-08-12,[R] Why and when tying embedding (a story),u/f14-bertolotti,MachineLearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1eqm0lr/r_why_and_when_tying_embedding_a_story/,"Hello, fellow Redditors! I want to share a little research journey that took place during my work. Instead of presenting it like a traditional research paper, I’ll try to make it more engaging and fun to read. I hope you find this approach interesting, and I’d love to hear your thoughts and feedback in the comments!

# Background

Many of you might already be familiar with a technique called Weight Tying (WT), which was first proposed [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05859). In simple terms, WT works by sharing the weights between the input embedding layer and the output embedding layer (also known as the unembedding layer, output embedding layer, or pre-softmax layer). This technique is primarily used in the context of language modeling and offers two significant advantages:

1. It reduces the memory footprint by eliminating one of the two largest parameter matrices in large language models (LLMs).
2. It often results in better and faster outcomes.

While the first benefit is widely accepted, the second is a bit more complex. In fact, some LLMs use WT, while others do not. For example, I believe that Gemma uses WT, whereas LLaMa does not. This raises the question: why is that?

If you are interested, I found particularly insightful perspectives on this topic in this [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1d2iurw/d_should_the_embedding_matrix_and_final/).

# Origin of the Idea

Earlier this year, I began exploring how to formalize the concept of semantic equivalence in neural networks. Interestingly, we can adapt the classical notion of semantics, commonly used in programming languages (see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denotational_semantics)). In computer theory, two programs are considered semantically equivalent if, regardless of the context in which they are executed, they yield the same resulting context. To borrow from denotational semantics, we can express this as:

https://preview.redd.it/9wiyxh815aid1.png?width=268&format=png&auto=webp&s=c710b2162f616f3a1181c2fddb0dc1c5cba20b55

This can be read as: *""Program p\_1 is semantically equivalent to p\_2 if and only if, for all contexts* ρ, *the evaluation of p\_1 with* ρ *produces the same result as the evaluation of p\_2 with* ρ\*.""\*

But how do we adapt this notion to our scenario? Let's consider a simple example from Masked Language Modeling (MLM):

*""The <MASK> of water is half empty/full.""*

It’s clear that we can use either ""empty"" or ""full"" in this sentence without changing the outcome distribution of the `<MASK>` token. Therefore, we can say that ""empty"" and ""full"" are semantically equivalent in this context (""The <MASK> of water is half \_\_\_""). Realizing that two tokens are semantically equivalent if they can be swapped without affecting the output distribution, I arrived at this definition:

$$ \\sigma\_1 \\equiv \\sigma\_2 \\iff \\forall \\rho, y: p(y|\\rho,\\sigma\_1) = p(y|\\rho,\\sigma\_2) $$

This expresses that tokens σ\_1 and σ\_2 are semantically equivalent if, for any context ρ and outcome y, the probability distribution of y given ρ and σ\_1 is identical to the probability distribution of y given ρ and σ\_2.

# Preliminary experiments

With this notion in mind, I wanted to explore how a neural network would encode these semantic equivalences in its weights. I suspected that embeddings for semantically equivalent tokens would naturally become closer to each other during training. This intuition was partly based on my knowledge that BERT embeddings capture similar relationships, where words like ""learn,"" ""learning,"" and ""learned"" are clustered together in the embedding space (see [here](https://home.ttic.edu/~kgimpel/viz-bert/viz-bert.html)).

To test this idea, I designed a simple experiment. The goal was to train a Masked Language Model (MLM) on a binary parity problem. Consider a string like `10011D`, where there are three `1`s, indicating that the string is odd. Along with the binary string, I included a parity label (`D` for odd and `E` for even). For instance, other examples could be `11000E` and `00100D`. Then, I introduced a twist: I randomly swapped the symbol `1` with either `A` or `B` with equal probability. So, from a string like `10011D`, you might get something like `A00BAD`. Finally, I masked one of the symbols and trained a model to predict the masked symbol. This process resulted in a dataset like the following:

|Sample|Label|
|:-|:-|
|`00A?00E`|A|
|`00A?00E`|B|
|`00B?00E`|A|
|`00B?00E`|B|
|`0BB?A0D`|0|

In this setup, symbols `A` and `B` are semantically equivalent by design—swapping `A` with `B` does not change the outcome distribution. As expected, the embeddings for `A` and `B` converged to be close to each other, while both remained distinct from the embedding of `0`. Interestingly, this behavior was also observed in the output embeddings, which neatly aligns with the principles of the Weight Tying technique.

# Formalizing the behavior

If it were up to me, I would have been content writing a paper on the observation that MLMs learn semantic relationships in both the input and output embedding layers. However, to publish in a reputable conference, a bit of mathematical rigor is usually required (even though math isn’t my strongest suit). So, I attempted to formalize this behavior.

# Output Embeddings

When it came to the output embeddings, I couldn't prove that two semantically equivalent symbols must be close in the output embedding space. However, I did manage to prove that they would be close under the following condition:

https://preview.redd.it/xrgs5gm15aid1.png?width=167&format=png&auto=webp&s=4645df4fd53ccd7777936be9926d6018fffba9ff

Interestingly, this result is purely about conditional probability and doesn’t directly involve labels or semantics. However since it provided some insight, I was reasonably satisfied and decided to move on.

# Input Embeddings

For the input embeddings, I was able to prove that two semantically equivalent symbols would indeed be close to each other in the input embedding space. However, the assumptions required for this proof were so restrictive that they would likely never hold in a real-world scenario. So, it ended up being a ""junk"" theorem, written more for the sake of publication than for practical application. Despite this, the intuition behind it still feels compelling.

The idea is simple: if two symbols are semantically equivalent—meaning they can be swapped without affecting the model’s output—the easiest way to ensure this is by giving them identical embeddings. In this way, the network's output remains unchanged by definition.

Proving this theorem, however, was a real challenge. I spent several days in the lab working on it, only to have my results scrutinized by colleagues and find errors. It took me about two to three weeks to produce a proof that could withstand their reviews. Despite the struggles, I remember this period as a particularly enjoyable part of my PhD journey.

# The First Draft

Armed with these two theorems—one for the output embeddings and one for the input embeddings—I began writing the first draft of my paper. My goal was to convey the idea that **LLMs are semantic learners**. I started by introducing the concept of semantic equivalence, followed by the theorem related to input embeddings. Next, I presented the output embedding theorem.

However, as I progressed, I realized that I was missing something crucial: experimental evidence to support the output embedding theorem. While the theoretical groundwork was in place, without empirical validation, the argument felt incomplete (at least this is what a reviewer would say).

# Back to the experiments (First time)

As I mentioned earlier, I proved the following implication (though I’m omitting some of the hypotheses here):

https://preview.redd.it/xvmu4t025aid1.png?width=354&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0e1332ef0232481cb136719451ac609cfa42693

So, I decided to rerun the experiments, this time closely monitoring the output embeddings. As expected, the output embeddings of `A` and `B` did indeed converge, becoming close to each other.

This finding was quite fascinating to me. On one hand, we have semantically equivalent symbols that are close in the input embedding space. On the other hand, we have conditionally equivalent symbols—those with the same conditional probability across all contexts (for all ρ: p(σ\_1 | ρ) = p(σ\_2 | ρ))—that are close in the output space.

# Back to the Draft (First Time)

With these new experiments in hand, I revised the draft, introducing the concept of conditional equivalence and the theorem connecting it to output embeddings. This allowed me to clearly articulate how conditional equivalence is reflected in the output embeddings.

As I was writing, it struck me that the Weight Tying (WT) technique is often employed in these scenarios. But this led to a new question: what happens if we use WT with symbols that are conditionally equivalent but not semantically equivalent? On one hand, these symbols should be close in the input embedding space. On the other hand, they should be far apart in the output embedding space because they have different conditional probabilities. However, with WT, the input and output spaces are tied together, making it impossible for two symbols to be simultaneously close and far apart.

This realization sent me back to the experiments to investigate this particular setting.

# Back to the Experiments (Second Time)

In our previous experiments, we established that the probability of seeing `A` is the same as `B` in any given context. Now, let's introduce another layer of complexity by replacing the symbol `0` with symbols `X` and `Y`, but this time, `X` will be more probable than `Y`. This changes our dataset to something like this:

|Sample|Label|
|:-|:-|
|`XYA?XXE`|A|
|`XXA?XYE`|B|
|`Y?BAXYE`|X|
|`XXBBX?E`|Y|
|`XBB?AYD`|0|

When we train an MLM model on this dataset, it’s easy to observe that in the input embedding space, `X` and `Y` become close to each other, just like `A` and `B`. This is because `X` and `Y` are semantically equivalent. However, unlike `A` and `B`, `X` and `Y` do not get close in the output embedding space because they have different conditional probabilities.

Now, what happens if we tie the embeddings? We observe that `A` and `B` converge more quickly, while `X` and `Y` remain distanced from each other. Additionally, we noticed that training becomes a bit more unstable—the distance between `X` and `Y` fluctuates significantly during training. Overall, the untied model tends to perform better, likely because it avoids the conflicting requirements imposed by weight tying.

# Back to the Draft, Again (Third Time)

I was quite pleased with the results we obtained, so I eagerly incorporated them into the paper. As I was revising, I also discussed the idea that Weight Tying (WT) should be used only when conditionally equivalent symbols are also semantically equivalent. This can be expressed as:

https://preview.redd.it/g79ejj825aid1.png?width=441&format=png&auto=webp&s=67298479da49374d80ddcce7b716c5e4e5ef558c

Or, more concisely:

https://preview.redd.it/g5nle0h25aid1.png?width=216&format=png&auto=webp&s=68f0d715abf87495ae49273b518df6ccedc8a148

While discussing this property, I realized that my explanation closely mirrored the hypothesis that *""similar words have similar contexts""*. This concept, which I later discovered is known as the **Distributional Hypothesis**, made the whole paper click together. I then restructured the work around this central concept.

If we accept the formalization of the Distributional Hypothesis as σ\_1 sem.eqv. σ\_2 iff. σ\_1 cnd.eqv. σ\_2, then it follows that WT should be employed only when this hypothesis holds true.

# Submission & Reviews

With [ICML2024](https://icml.cc/Conferences/2024) being the next major conference on the horizon, we decided to submit our work there. Most of the reviews were helpful and positive, but a recurring critique was the lack of ""large-scale"" experiments.

I simply do not understand this obsession with experiments that require hundreds of GPUs. I mean, I submitted a paper mostly theoretical aiming to explain a very well-known phenomenon supported by a vast literature, isn't a small controlled experiment enough (which is included mostly to make the paper self-contained) when backed by the literature?

Well, I am a nobody in the research community, furthermore this is my first publication at a ""Big"" conference like ICML so I complied although these experiments do not add practically anything.

In the end, I was thrilled to have the paper accepted as a spotlight poster. It was a huge milestone for me, making me feel like a genuine researcher in the field. I dedicated almost a month to preparing the poster and video presentation, which can be viewed [here](https://icml.cc/virtual/2024/poster/32648). The effort was well worth it!

# Conference & Presentation

On the day of the conference, I arrived around 9 A.M. with only an hour of sleep from the flight—naturally, I was too excited to rest properly. I made it to the conference a bit late, and during the first tutorial session, I struggled to stay awake despite my best efforts with coffee. A little before lunch, I headed back to the hotel to catch a few hours of sleep. In the evening I attended the great tutorial presentation [physics of Language Model](https://icml.cc/virtual/2024/tutorial/35223).

In the next days, I made a few friends. Talked to a lot of people included [Alfredo Canziani](https://atcold.github.io/), an incredible AI communicator, and [Randall Balestriero](https://randallbalestriero.github.io/) an incredible scientist in the field. I saw also [Michael Bronstein](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/michael.bronstein/) but of course, he was always surrounded and I could not bring myself to talk to him.

The last poster session was my time to present, and I was quite nervous, as it was my first time presenting at such a conference. To my surprise, many attendees weren’t familiar with the Distributional Hypothesis—a concept I assumed everyone would know, even though I hadn’t known the term myself. This made me question the effectiveness of my paper’s ""marketing"" (presentation, title, etc.). Perhaps I should have emphasized the ""semantics"" aspect more.

One particularly memorable interaction was with a tall guy from DeepMind. He listened to part of my presentation and then pointed out, in a very polite manner, that my theorems might not be correct. I was confident in the proofs, which had been reviewed by a PhD student in mathematics who had won some math competitions. We debated back and forth until I understood his argument, which involved a specific construction of the embedding matrices. He was right, but his argument broke one of the theorems' assumptions. You have to know that, I was not even showing this hypothesis on the poster because I did not believe that anyone would have been interested in these details. This guy practically had a deeper understanding of my theorems than me without seeing them. Well, in conclusion, Deepmind has some freaking guys working there.

# Conclusions

* **Use Weight Tying Only When the Distributional Hypothesis Holds**.
* **DeepMind Has Some Incredible People**
* **Do not go to the tutorials with 1hr of sleep** (3hr are okay though).
* **Writing the Paper is Crucial**: While I previously believed that experiments should come first, I now realize the importance of writing down your ideas early. Putting thoughts into words often clarifies and integrates concepts in ways experiments alone may not. This is perhaps the most valuable lesson I’ve learned from this paper.

# Limitations & Future works

If you're considering using the Weight Tying (WT) technique, you might wonder: when does the Distributional Hypothesis (DH) actually hold? Does it apply to your specific problem? Does it apply to natural language tasks in general?

Answering these questions can be challenging and may not always be feasible. Consequently, this work may have limited practical utility. It simply pushes the question when applying WT to when the DH holds. However, I suspect that the DH only partially holds for natural language, which might explain why not all LLMs use WT.

So, my idea is that it should be more useful to run the training with WT up until a certain point and then untie the embeddings to allow differences between tokens that are conditionally eqv. but not semantically eqv. (or vice versa) to arise. Unfortunately, I lack the GPU resources to train a meaningful LLM to test this hypothesis. If anyone is interested in exploring this idea or knows of similar work, I would greatly appreciate hearing about it."

# 🚫 FCC cracks down on AI

# 

https://preview.redd.it/uggrbar17bid1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=b83baab316e2d54398eaf0344fa4191d4dadb25b

The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) just proposed new regulations requiring AI-generated voice calls to disclose the use of artificial intelligence.

* The proposal aims to combat the rise of AI-generated voices in unwanted and potentially fraudulent ‘robocalls’.
* AI voices would be required to explicitly state they are artificial at the beginning of calls.
* The FCC is also exploring tools to alert people when they receive AI-generated calls and texts, including enhanced call filters, AI-based detection algorithms, and improved caller ID flagging.

As AI voices become indistinguishable from human speech, these regulations are crucial in combating highly targeted scams. But with enforcement likely to be a cat-and-mouse game against scammers, the best defence is education—especially for those most vulnerable to AI deception.

# 🗣️ ChatGPT unexpectedly began speaking in a user’s cloned voice during testing

#  

* During testing, ChatGPT's Advanced Voice Mode accidentally mimicked users' voices without their consent, as highlighted in OpenAI's new GPT-4o system card released on Thursday.
* OpenAI has implemented safeguards to prevent unauthorized voice imitation, although rare episodes during testing showcased the model's ability to unintentionally generate user-like voices.
* The GPT-4o AI model can synthesize almost any sound, and OpenAI directs this capability by using authorized voice samples and employing an output classifier to ensure only selected voices are generated.

1ered0f,1,2024-08-13,Seeking Advice on Transitioning to Physics After a PhD in Health Economics,u/Other_Procedure1971,PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1ered0f/seeking_advice_on_transitioning_to_physics_after/,"Hi everyone,

I’m currently in the midst of pursuing a PhD in Health Economics in Germany (and I'm from another European country). I’m in my mid-20s, and if everything goes according to plan, I should finish my PhD by the time I’m 27 or 28. While I’m passionate about economics and enjoy my research, I’ve found myself increasingly drawn to the idea of studying physics, particularly the thought of engaging with frontier research.

To give you a bit of background without revealing too much for privacy reasons, I initially chose to study economics during my undergraduate years, largely out of a fear that I wouldn’t be able to handle the more challenging coursework in a subject like physics. Now, after come years of academic experience and research, I feel more confident in my ability to tackle difficult subjects and am seriously considering starting from scratch with a bachelor’s degree in physics once I complete my current PhD.

My ultimate goal is to dive deep into the world of physics by completing a full academic path in the field. This would involve starting with a bachelor’s degree, followed by a master’s, and eventually pursuing a PhD in physics. Although I’m still refining my specific interests, I’m particularly drawn to the fundamental study of matter, as well as the more mathematical and theoretical aspects of physics. Additionally, I’m intrigued by the potential to bridge physics and economics, exploring interdisciplinary research that could combine insights from both fields. 

Here are a few questions I’d appreciate your insights on:

1. **Is it realistic to start over with a bachelor's in physics after completing a PhD in another field?** Have there been cases of people successfully transitioning from a completely different discipline to physics at this stage in life? 
2. **How can I leverage the skills and experiences from my PhD in Health Economics to succeed as a physics student?** Are there any transferable skills that might give me a head start? 
3. **Financial sustainability:** How feasible is it to study physics while working, either within academia in my current field (economics) or potentially in industry? Are there common pathways where one can balance both? I’m also curious about opportunities to teach or do research part-time in economics while pursuing a physics degree, or if it would be more practical to find a job in the industry that aligns better with this new academic path.
4. **Career prospects:** After completing a PhD in physics, how might my career opportunities be affected compared to staying in my current field? Would I be limiting my prospects, or could I open up new possibilities? Are there specific careers where I could fully leverage expertise in both economics and physics?

Thank you in advance for any advice, experiences, or guidance you can offer! This is a big decision for me, and I’m trying to gather as much information as possible to make an informed choice.

1erpmgx,1,2024-08-13,AITAH for almost entirely redoing a ppt and giving my opinion on something involved with that?,u/Introvertedtravelgrl,AITAH,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1erpmgx/aitah_for_almost_entirely_redoing_a_ppt_and/,"PLEASE, PLEASE Help. Sorry it's a long one.

I recently did some work for an organization and have been seriously wondering if I've overstepped or done something wrong. Because of this, you're not likely to get kickback from me if I AITAH. 

So I applied to do something else with this organization (unfortunately I have to be vague about some this while being as honest as possible) but was contacted to help them with something else in the interim only temporarily with the understanding that I would be able to do the position I originally applied for in the fall. 

Main responsibilities (as understood them) were to: critique teacher lesson plans for anything that didn't meet the guidlines of the organization (I wasn't really given any specific guidelines but I went with what I knew of the mission and teaching in general) and report anything concerning to my supervisor. The other responsibility was to help with a very important ppt presentation. My supervisor either wasn't thoroughly familiar with all the workings of PPT or didn't care but asked me to clean it up, make edits and add content to areas I was familiar with (things I had reports for or direct information). So I did. My supervisor was a lovely person, truly but really bad at communicating in a clear, concise organized way. I tried to leave the position early on because of the communication issue, without mentioning it but I was persuaded to continue on, so I did. 

So during the critique part, I delicately asked about a teacher's comments on (the plans were pretty empty) and what I got was mild defensiveness. So I stopped asking and didn't really intensively critique anymore. Then the PPT, I got a barrage of different emails with various instructions and files, as my supervisor refused to communicate by phone when I wasn't working in the same place. So I tried my best to do what was asked, ploughing through the emails, trying to make sense of them and reply. All the while, my supervisor sending me flowery compliments and gratitude on my work. By the end of the week, on a Friday, I thought I had finished everything, but late that night my supervisor sends more stuff and more requests for the PPT. So I do it, but they also send other conclicting emails ""Can you do this by this day?"" ""You don't have to do more"" etc. I was so confused, on top of the fact I never said I was available on weekends but I did it. Then Sunday I get more emails and one seems like it wants me to add more content and edit and another seems like it was indirectly saying thanks but stop touching the PPT. 

Truthfully, the PPT before I got to it was awful. Using those pre-created templates of 'put picture here' and 'text here'. And SOOOO MUCH text all over the slide. So I just used chatgpt to take the content and condense it so it was digestible and then reformatted the slides to be more viewer friendly. While doing that I was also reading teacher comments on students and one of them said something that I thought seemed not nice about a student, so I mentioned it and my supervisor seemed irritated that I mentioned it. Anyway, I stopped working on the PPT. They thanked me and I asked about the position that was dangled like a carrot in front of me from the beginning, and they said they I just needed to contact so and so. But here's the weird part, they said, ""I spoke to the person in charge of that position and they're really excited to meet with you"" but doesn't give me their name, instead tells me to contact another person (that I had initially been in contact with) and also asks me to log my hours (this is not a paid position) which I hadn't been told to or how to at all in the beginning (really poor communication) so  I emailed the person she told me to plus the person who set up my technology account, and prior to the powerpoint both people had been very responsive. Now? Ghost town. 

The PPT was theirs, but they seemed to tell me to edit it where necessary. That seemed to be my job. Now I'm wondering whether I am the AH for putting so much work into it and maybe they perceived it as arrogance? I'm spinning in an anxiety circle wondering if this is my fault and I have something I need to fix about my interactions or it really was an unfixable situation to start and I got pulled into an existing bad situation. (I received zero training on anything, and anything I did learn I had to teach myself by googling the shit out of.)

I'm not going to follow up because I already feel like I've been scolded even though every email was flattery, but it was so thick you could tell it wasn't all genuine. 

Any thoughts on this would be greatly appreciated. I bear no ill-will on anyone involved, I'm just so disappointed \[and feel like shit\] how this turned out as I really want to be of help and also hoped I would be able to do the position I applied for."

Took me two weeks to pass this god forsaken class. I have never had as miserable a time in a class as this one. 

  
Memorizing block sizes, key sizes, and rounds for each cipher is ridiculous. If I wanted to become a rolodex of cryptographic ciphers I would have done that myself. In all my years of working, I have never needed to know deep and dirty specifics, they have always been available to freely access. I do not know how the people in charge can justify this. We should be prioritizing methods, techniques, procedures, use cases, etc. not these fact sheets. FISH was used during WWll, I have no reason for remembering it besides the fact that it WAS used (even that is negligible). 

The book is garbage, mistakes are much too numerous to base the class off of. I would not even read that garbage, just google the chapter requirements and learn from chatgpt or use the student drive. Then memorize the notes you have taken for them.

  
Two weeks of stress for a needless class. Fuck it, just get that degree. "

some time ago i did somewhat well for an assignment, and my teacher praised me infront of the entire class. as someone who already hates being the centre of attention, i just wanted to dig a hole into a ground and hide. i feel extremely pressured to continue scoring well since my teacher set that expectation of me infront of everyone and i feel like an imposter pretending to be someone smart and talented. 

i hate it so much whenever i voice my anxiety about exams and my friends mention how i’m a “liar” and that i’m the “top scorer in class who always does well” rather than comforting me like they do for others. i genuinely have so much anxiety or stress over it, but it’s like they completely disregard it, which i find upsetting. but is this a me problem? am i in the wrong here without realising it 😭 and sometimes when we get back results they fake annoyance with me when i actually do well instead of showing support, which i guess is normal between friends but it doesn’t diminish my feelings because i have never flexed my results to anyone before, not even on social media or anything. instead i usually just get secretly happy and keep quiet about it. i get so so embarrassed when people point it out it makes me want to shrivel up like a raisin.

i guess what i’m trying to say is that i wish i didn’t do so well to the point where others notice or even worse, see me as a threat. am i overthinking this? am i in the wrong for not putting in 100% of the work before exams? i really really hate feeling like this sm 😭😭 "

I feel so demoralised because i spend most of my free time studying whenever I can, even staying in during the weekends and sacrificing my hobbies to study. I feel so jealous whenever I see my classmates getting higher GPAs (3.5-3.7 range) while not studying as much as me and maintaining a good social life. I constantly wonder what I'm doing wrong but I can never seem to find the answer, and i feel like all the effort that i poured into studying really went down the drain.  I'm so tired of forcing myself to study for hours only to achieve grades that are mediocre compared to my peers, and its been  like this since the semester started. Most of my grades aren't even that good and now that ESE's are approaching, I really don't feel like studying, or bring myself to at least. Everytime I feel confident about how I performed in a test, I would still end up with a B or a C. If anyone saw my gpa right now they'd probably assume that I'd be the type to slack in group projects/ skip classes. I'm so tired of putting so much effort into studying and not seeing one bit of it show up in my results. I feel so devastated right now because I recently got a B- for a module that I actually enjoyed studying for, because no matter how hard i study the content the test questions would be completely different than I expected. Also i find it quite difficult to concentrate while studying, everything feels like a dream and i can't really bring myself to focus (idk how to explain it) and sleep isn't a problem because i make sure to get 7-8 hours of sleep. At this point i'd be satisfied with a gpa that is at least above 3, I'm so tired of not seeing my hardwork show into my results, and i can't even motivate myself by thinking my grades would improve because they haven't. I honestly miss the traditional secondary school style of learning as it was more slow paced and fits my learning style way more than poly does, but sadly i didn't do well enough to get into jc. I'm so done with this, I can't wait to graduate poly and maybe do something else that I might enjoy. And if you're still reading this I just wanna say thanks for staying till the end :)

1es659v,1,2024-08-14,ChatGPT's Impact on Virtual Learning in Education and Corporate Training Environments,u/cporter202,ChatGPTautomation,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTautomation/comments/1es659v/chatgpts_impact_on_virtual_learning_in_education/,"As we delve deeper into the 21st century, technology continues to reshape myriad aspects of life, education, and work. One of the latest innovations at the frontier is OpenAI's ChatGPT, a potent tool that's changing the landscapes of virtual learning in both the education sector and corporate training environments.

ChatGPT's ability to understand and generate human-like text has made it an incredibly resourceful assistant for learners and trainers alike. In educational institutes, this AI can help create more interactive study materials and simulate one-on-one tutoring experiences for students. Learners can query the system in natural language, getting instant explanations on complex topics, or assistance with practice exercises. This can be particularly transformative in settings with limited human resources.

In the corporate realm, ChatGPT is reinventing employee training and development. It's enabling personalized learning experiences at scale, allowing employees to train at their own pace and on demand. From onboarding to ongoing professional development, ChatGPT can supply immediate, relevant information and training, fostering a culture of continuous learning and adaptation.

The implications are vast – educators can leverage ChatGPT to design curriculum and assessments, while corporate trainers can structure entire training programs around the technology. Moreover, the potential for language learning, soft skill development, and intricate technical training suggests a future where the boundaries of knowledge expansion are significantly lessened.

However, challenges such as ensuring quality control, maintaining engagement, and addressing ethical considerations of AI in education and training must be met with thoughtful strategies.

Let's discuss how ChatGPT is impacting virtual learning and how we can best harness this technology to enhance educational outcomes and corporate efficiency. How do you see AI like ChatGPT shaping the future of learning and professional development? Share your experiences, ideas, and any concerns you might have about this technological evolution."
1esawkt,6,2024-08-14,"CMV: AI has the ability to ""break"" society in the next years",u/outm,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1esawkt/cmv_ai_has_the_ability_to_break_society_in_the/,"For context, I'm a CS person working on tech and ""kinda"" related to processes we're adding ""AI"" into (yeah, I know, a lot of times AI is just a buzzword for things that are not \*really\* AI) - so this isn't a post from someone thinking of AI like ""magic"".

But still, I'm worried for all the tech entails when it comes to the general public and businesses and all its capabilities, which are quickly enough improving at a high speed and as a tool, allow you to either raise the potential to do good and bad things. Why I'm worried? Some motives for me:

* **Adding random background noise**: AI is being used (and more every day) as a cheap ghost-writing for a lot of webpages and blogs that are trying to cut real people writers wages, or as leads/SEO for businesses, scams and referral-sites. This means we end up losing the ability to find ""real useful"" info on the internet, we are more exposed to find ""confidently wrong"" answers (like when Google AI was recommending people to eat rocks as a healthy habit) and the internet consuption of resources are potential going to be higher and higher (so more energy consumed) just because the generation of that data, storage and serving it.

* **Worsening average educational system effectiveness**: AI can be used for good on education, of course ( for example, helping create, explain and resolve problems, or practising a new language on a chat and making corrections) but I think the potential ""bad"" for the average student will be net loss. Students have it easier than ever to just pass through AI problems they ""should have"" to resolve themselves to practise and find struggles to learn, to write essays that should require a lot of reading, synthesis and writing/explaining skills and just ""cheat"" - homeworks are effectively dead on its majority and the work in-class can be compromised (and it's limited: you can't do multi-hour essays like a degree thesis on class). People won't work hard for 100hr if the next person is doing a similar good enoug job in 5hr (but, without learning that much).

* **Adding more to the gap rich-poor people**: it was recently reported on another reddit thread-article, that HR are overwhelmed by receiving resumes made with AI - but not only that, they demonstrated that being a paying user of an AI service like ChatGPT gets you better probabilities given the output is of better quality and ""differential"" to those of the free version. Similarly, it can happen again with education: the kid that happens to be able to access a paid AI service will be ahead of the poor kid who isn't able to get it, given both use it. This means AI is essentially helping ""richer"" people to get ahead of ""poor"" people on education or job work/opportunities simply by putting a tiered paywall into the qualities of the tech. You pay more, you get more. It has the potential to add for the gap rich-poor.

* **Dehumanizing art and cultural creations**: It's well-known AI is getting/gonna be used to write scripts, images, videos, ""paintings"", poems, videogames stories and assets, parts of books and so on. Those creations are just based on the AI learned and integrated huge data base of previous human creations (so, usually won't be creating ""new"" paths) and will be hugely trained to just make creations that are the most possible success. So for example, niche or risky cultural creations will be passed more easily. The AI thinks the idea of ""Matrix"" is niche and less success-prone than a Marvel movie? Welcome to a timeline where Matrix is never made, but we have 60 Marvel movies. Also, this trends have the ability to discourage coming into arts careers.

* **Less jobs and crappier services and products**: We are seeing lots of companies considering using AI to cut positions and jobs, even if sometimes it means a loss of quality, because ""it's worth it"". You can make a 8/10 videogame paying a team of 10 to develop the story and script, or make a 6,5/10 videogame paying a team of 2 to do the same. Now, multiple for bigger companies. Customer service? I can pay peanuts for an offshore customer service (because employing good quality local people is too expensive, of course) or even cut that and expect the AI resolves your problem. If some customers end up on a loop and leaving the company, that's just a calculated risk and price for the money saved. Not too far ahead I'm even seeing a future where ""poor"" people is derived (as an ""apartheid"" system) to AI systems by insurances and private healthcare systems, while richer ones are prioritised to be treated by humans and better doctors.

* **Increasing many folds fake news and disinformation**: As recently was reported, now X allows users using its AI to, for example, generate pics of Kamala Harris with guns or Pope Francis sniffing cocaine (in fact, last year became viral a pic of Pope Francis wearing a large puffy, made by AI). AI will help people to just get deeper into echo-chambers, be paranoid, build political distrust and polarisation.

* **Breaking ""justice"" potential evidences**: Until now, a public place recording, a conversation at some contexts, pics or just ""I plead guilty"" recorded confessions could be taken sometimes as ""hard"" evidence. Now, AI is building a future where that data can be easily turned ""trash"" and not valid, no matter the metadata, not only because it will be easy to make false evidences, but also good alibis.

* **Increasing incentive and ability to compromise people privacy (and increasing stuff, food and services prices)**: Now it's easier than ever to just use AI to proccess and interlink multiple ""users touchpoints"", metadata, interactions and even what they do or where they travel to, to try and sell more. As an example, recently was reported multiple supermarket are starting to work into ""unique grocery store for every customer"", because analysing each person and their probability to pay for someone at a given cost, allows you to charge the maximum price to each person. Random example: Tom needs a cartridge to work, is known, and is a usual customer that doesn't hesitate when taking it from the self. Emma has just bought a new printer and is still on the returns period. At 60$, Tom will buy and Emma will return the printer and find an alternative. At $80 for Tom and $20 for Emma, Tom buys, Emma keeps the printer and buys, and then you will be able to raise her price.

  
Not only am I worried about the future society where AI is a part of us, but also think for the common people, the ending net is a loss. For a few people (usually, richest ones, big businesses and so on) it will be a huge boost and even allow the biggest sharks to control the market and avoid newcomers from growing and taking their places, damaging economy on the long run as the ""too big to fail"" will just accomodate (Google, Microsoft, whatever)

So... what do you think? Thanks."

I have been slacking in my Chinese studies and I want to pick it up again and I have thought about learning Chinese words while preparing my classes for my students. 

I wonder if chatgpt can be used to translate basic phrases. Like how is the weather, how are you, when do you start working etc. and things like that. 

I have a Chinese student and I would like to learn some phrases so I can help her since she doesn’t speak English.

When I ask them ""Explain this issue to me"" their response will be a series of vague statements about 3-5x longer than any reasonable answer.  This not only takes much longer to mark but these ""kitchen sink"" responses leave me with the impression that the student really hasn't learned anything.

So, in light of this I ran a course this summer where I took an exercise which requires you to write a few short explanations on a particular scenario and put significant length limits on each one.  This includes both straight-up word limits and limiting topics.  ""Express one idea that you consider the best approach to X"".  I point out that anything over the word limit or if you express more than one idea this extra text is simply not read.

I'm just comparing these things now and this seems to produce better work.  In fact, I'm thinking of dropping some of the word counts even more. Anyone have similar experiences?

I also created a specific form that every student has to use, this stops the handing in of increasingly elaborate ""art projects"" where students use title pages, odd text layouts and just far more effort into aesthetics than a simple weekly assignment warrants.  Call me cynical but I suspect several of these are an attempt to try and avoid getting caught by TurnItIn"
1eszmyu,1,2024-08-15,Leveraging ChatGPT for Data Analysis and Reporting in Diverse Industries,u/cporter202,ChatGPTautomation,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTautomation/comments/1eszmyu/leveraging_chatgpt_for_data_analysis_and/,"In today's data-driven world, the role of AI, and particularly language models like ChatGPT, in data analysis and reporting cannot be understated. With industries ranging from finance to healthcare, and from retail to manufacturing, the potential for leveraging such technology is immense.

ChatGPT, with its advanced natural language processing abilities, is enhancing the way we handle data analysis and reporting. For example, in the finance sector, ChatGPT can assist analysts by summarizing complex financial reports, interpreting stock market trends, and even providing insights into vast datasets that humans might take much longer to analyze.

In healthcare, the implications are equally significant. ChatGPT can process patient data, understand medical histories, and assist in creating comprehensive reports that can help healthcare professionals make better-informed decisions. The technology can condense information from various patient interactions to provide a holistic view of a patient's medical journey.

Retail companies are harnessing ChatGPT to analyze customer feedback, market trends, and sales data, automating the reporting process and consequently enabling data-driven strategies that boost customer satisfaction and business growth. By interpreting consumer behavior patterns, ChatGPT can inform marketing strategies and help tailor the retail experience to individual needs.

Manufacturing is another sector where data analysis and reporting are crucial. ChatGPT can swiftly process quality control data, supply chain information, and production metrics, turning these into actionable insights that can streamline processes and mitigate risks.

Educational organizations, too, are finding ChatGPT invaluable for analyzing student performance data and feedback, which can inform personalized teaching methods and improve educational resources.

However, the implementation of ChatGPT in such diverse industries is not without challenges. Privacy concerns, data security, and the need for contextual understanding are just some hurdles that need to be addressed to ensure reliable and ethical use of this technology.

Indeed, the benefits of incorporating ChatGPT into data analysis and reporting across various industries are profound, but they require thoughtful integration with existing systems and workflows. How industries adapt and manage these advanced AI tools will shape the future of data-driven decision-making. Let's engage in a thoughtful discussion on best practices, experiences, and potential barriers to leveraging ChatGPT for data analysis and reporting across different sectors. Your insights and expertise could help pave the way forward for AI's role in transforming industry landscapes."

Generative AI models like ChatGPT opened up a whole world of opportunity to use AI writing for any task requiring text. Everyone then expected that students would then use AI-generated content for academic writing. Perhaps what people didn't expect is [reportedly half of American students using AI for schoolwork](https://www.bestcolleges.com/research/most-college-students-have-used-ai-survey/).

Academia’s response to this phenomenon was to integrate AI detectors like Turnitin into their student submission portals so that everything they submit passes through a plagiarism checker.

ChatGPT will almost always fail to bypass Turnitin, so people look at different AI writing tools such as AI paraphrasers or Stealth AI to bypass detection systems. You might be asking yourself though, do AI paraphrasers work?

# What Is An AI Paraphraser?

An AI Paraphraser takes AI-generated text and simply rewords and rephrases it. It gives you snappier synonyms and injects a little style, maybe simplifies for clarity. The two major AI paraphrasing tools that do this are Grammarly and Quillbot.

Here's the rub though, the paraphrasers do change the text around, but they don’t neccesarily remove the watermarks of AI writing. And because those watermarks are still present, they can just as easily fail AI detection as if you were to use ChatGPT.

# What is Turnitin?

Turnitin is the most popular and commonly used AI content detector. It’s detection system isn’t just an AI checker, it’s a plagiarism checker as well. Turnitin AI Detection takes every measure to ensure the text you submit are your own words.

Still, even Turnitin will give false positives at a 4% rate on the sentence-level. It also commonly lets AI writing bypass as human writing. Many academic institutions have settled on the notion that [AI detectors don’t work](https://mitsloanedtech.mit.edu/ai/teach/ai-detectors-dont-work/), but for most, they have no other option.

# How Does Turnitin Detection Work?

ChatGPT's content is always written with the same algorithm that generates the simplest, most precise text in terms of word choice, sentence length, and sentence structure. The readability of the content is low and often doesn’t include the proper citation, even making up references at times.

Turnitin Detection works by analyzing the text to find the watermarks of AI writing. Those watermarks are measured as perplexity and burstiness, or in other words, the simplicity of words and sentences.

# How to Bypass Turnitin AI Detection

In order to bypass Turnitin or any AI detection tool, You have to manipulate the watermarks of AI writing. An AI paraphraser doesn’t neccesarily do that, but it inadvertently might in rephrasing the text. One should assume at least, that the text feels more human than the original ChatGPT output.

Here’s an essay I just asked ChatGPT to write about Adam Sandler movies:

As you can see, the writing style features low perplexity and readability coupled with precise word choice and sentences.

# Can Turnitin Detect Grammarly?

The Grammarly treatment allows me to take many suggestions with what to do with the text from rewording a few sentences to generating an entirely rephrased essay.

So, here's what ChatGPT's essay looks like are taking Grammarly’s suggestions to rephrase it completely:

Grammarly's suggested revision is in the text box that appears on the right. That's what we're going to pass through Turnitin to determine if AI paraphrasing is a good way to bypass AI detection tools.

Below we demonstrate what happens when our new AI Paraphraserized essay is passed through Turnitin:

Turnitin determined Grammarly’s rephrased Adam Sandler essay was still 95% AI Generated. So, one can conclude that yes, Turnitin can detect Grammarly.

Whether you pass it through a detector or read the text yourself, you will Grammarly couldn't remove the watermarks of AI writing. Paraphrased content isn’t humanized content. You can’t paraphrase AI text and expect it to bypass AI content detection.

The only way to submit AI-written content and have it bypass any detector from [Originality.AI](http://Originality.AI), to GPTZero, and of course, Turnitin AI detector, is using an AI humanizer to make the text undetectable.

# Can Undetectable AI Bypass Turnitin?

Undetectable AI is the how you would categorize text that has run through an undetectable service. However, because so many of these services are still caught by Turnitin’s radar, either because they’re outdated or never worked in the first place, the only way to make your text truly undetectable is going one level higher with Stealth AI.

Using StealthGPT’s Stealth AI system, we’re going to humanize our original Adam Sandler essay and see if it fares better against Turnitin than Grammarly.

Here’s how that essay looks passed through Stealth AI:

There it is in the output panel. It reads better already. And here’s the result after we pass it through Turnitin:

As you can see, Turnitin determined the Stealth AI text was 0% AI writing. Flawless victory.

# Conclusion

AI Paraphrasers are really only useful for correcting and rephrasing human writing. Any hope of bettering AI writing or making AI writing bypass Turnitin or any AI writing detection service isn't based in reality.

If you really want to bypass Turnitin and improve the writing style of a piece of AI text, you need to humanize it so it can have the perplexity and flow of human text.

The only way to do this is with an undetectable AI service and the only undetectable AI service guaranteed to deliver consistent results comes at the hands of StealthGPT’s unparralled Stealth AI.

# FAQ

# Can Turnitin Detect ChatGPT?

Absolutely. OpenAI created ChatGPT with writing skills for a specific purpose: Utility. Thus, the words and sentences need to always be simple and precise. ChatGPT doesn’t have the machine learning to sound human, so it always sounds like AI and Turnitin will always be able to detect it.

# Is Using ChatGPT plagiarism?

ChatGPT and other generative AI models only create original content. If you were to pass a research paper written by ChatGPT through an old fashioned plagiarism detection tool, it wouldn’t determine that you stole any words without crediting the original author.

However, whether using generative AI to write your research paper undermines academic integrity is a separate issue. In many cases it does, even though so many students are using it. That’s why many universities make the distinction of calling it “AI plagiarism”.

To create this smaller model from the original 8B model, Nvidia used structured pruning in the depth and width directions. Pruning is a technique that deletes less important layers or neurons of the network to reduce model size and complexity while retaining its performance. In this case, Nvidia performed the depth pruning by removing 16 layers from the model and downsizing it from an 8B to a 4B model. Another technique applied is width pruning through trimming embedding dimensions and MLP intermediate.

Besides pruning, Nvidia also applied classical distillation to enhance the efficiency of Llama-3.1-Minitron 4B. Knowledge distillation is a process whereby a smaller model, the student, is trained to mimic the behavior of a larger and more complex one, the teacher. In this way, much of the predictive power of the original model is preserved in the smaller model, but it is faster and more frugal in terms of resources.

1eua4p7,3,2024-08-17,Math SAT scores may be doing worse than we had thought?,u/Significant-Notice-,marginal,https://www.reddit.com/r/marginal/comments/1eua4p7/math_sat_scores_may_be_doing_worse_than_we_had/,"Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) is crucial for college admissions but its effectiveness and relevance are increasingly questioned. This paper enhances Synthetic Control methods by introducing Transformed Control, a novel method that employs Large Language Models (LLMs) powered by Artificial Intelligence to generate control groups. We utilize OpenAI’s API to generate a control group where GPT-4, or ChatGPT, takes multiple SATs annually from 2008 to 2023. This control group helps analyze shifts in SAT math difficulty over time, starting from the baseline year of 2008. Using parallel trends, we calculate the Average Difference in Scores (ADS) to assess changes in high school students’ math performance. Our results indicate a significant decrease in the difficulty of the SAT math section over time, alongside a decline in students’ math performance. The analysis shows a 71-point drop in the rigor of SAT math from 2008 to 2023, with student performance decreasing by 36 points, resulting in a 107-point total divergence in average student math performance. We investigate possible mechanisms for this decline in math proficiency, such as changing university selection criteria, increased screen time, grade inflation, and worsening adolescent mental health. Disparities among demographic groups show a 104-point drop for White students, 84 points for Black students, and 53 points for Asian students. Male students saw a 117-point reduction, while female students had a 100-point decrease. This research highlights the need to reconsider the SAT’s role in admissions and to update educational strategies to enhance high school math performance.

1eviuij,1,2024-08-18,Gadget 1.0 (using llama3.1) #Meta #ChatGPT #Grok #OpenAI,u/idunnojustanotherguy,ArtificialInteligence,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1eviuij/gadget_10_using_llama31_meta_chatgpt_grok_openai/,"# Thesis on Gadget1.0: A Modular AI-Powered System for Multi-Modal Interactions

**Abstract:** Gadget1.0 is an AI-driven framework designed to facilitate multi-modal interactions between a user and an AI model. Built on top of the LLaMA 3.1 model, the system integrates various modules to manage inputs such as text, audio, screenshots, and camera images, while providing outputs like text, speech, and mouse/keyboard control. The program leverages Python’s extensive ecosystem, incorporating subprocesses, threading, and queue management to maintain smooth operations and prevent bottlenecks. This thesis outlines the architecture, functionality, and code excerpts of Gadget1.0, showcasing its potential to serve as a versatile tool for research, automation, and interactive AI applications.

**1. Introduction:** Gadget1.0 was conceptualized as a robust AI-powered system capable of handling complex tasks involving multiple input and output formats. Its architecture ensures seamless interaction between the AI and the user while maintaining responsiveness even under varying computational loads. The system’s design is modular, allowing for easy expansion and adaptation to new tasks and inputs. The integration of LLaMA 3.1 as the core AI model enables sophisticated natural language processing and decision-making capabilities.

**2. System Architecture:** The core of Gadget1.0 is its modular architecture, which is built around several key components:

* **LLaMA Model Integration:** The system initiates a subprocess to run the LLaMA model, enabling AI-driven interactions.
* **Input Handling:** The program processes various input formats such as audio, text, screenshots, and camera images.
* **Output Generation:** The AI model generates outputs in multiple formats, including text, spoken audio, and mouse/keyboard actions.
* **Queue Management:** A queue system ensures that inputs are processed in the order they are received, preventing bottlenecks and maintaining smooth operation.
* **Subprocesses and Threading:** The program employs subprocesses and threading to manage parallel tasks, ensuring that the GUI remains responsive while the AI processes inputs.

**3. Code Overview:** The following excerpts highlight the key features of Gadget1.0’s code:

**3.1. LLaMA Model Integration:**

    pythonCopy codedef start_llama_model(model_name):
        command = f""ollama run {model_name}""
        process = subprocess.Popen(command, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stdin=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE, shell=True)
        debug(""Llama model started successfully."")
        return process
    

This function initializes the LLaMA model as a subprocess, allowing it to run concurrently with other tasks.

**3.2. Queue Management and Processing:**

    pythonCopy codedef enqueue_prompt(prompt):
        global prompt_queue
        prompt_queue.put(prompt)
        debug(f""Prompt added to queue: {prompt}"")
    
    def process_queue():
        global prompt_queue
        while True:
            if not prompt_queue.empty():
                prompt = prompt_queue.get()
                response = interact_with_llama(llama_process, prompt)
                handle_ai_response(response)
            time.sleep(delta_time)
    

These functions manage the queue of prompts sent to the AI, ensuring that inputs are processed in sequence.

(This feature has been extended to the AIs responses as well and both queues are Sorted with dialogue taking top priority over action and data retrieval(Obviously the queues are on seperate threads as well))

**3.3. Input Handling:**

    pythonCopy codedef listen_to_microphone():
        global mic_muted
        if mic_muted:
            debug(""Microphone is muted."")
            return None
        recognizer = sr.Recognizer()
        with sr.Microphone() as source:
            debug(""Listening for audio..."")
            audio = recognizer.listen(source)
            try:
                text = recognizer.recognize_google(audio)
                debug(f""Recognized audio: {text}"")
                return text
            except sr.UnknownValueError:
                debug(""Could not understand the audio."")
                return None
            except sr.RequestError as e:
                debug(f""Error with the recognition service: {e}"")
                return None
    

This function captures audio from the microphone and converts it to text, allowing the AI to process spoken commands.

**3.4. Output Generation:**

    pythonCopy codedef handle_ai_response(response):
        parts = response.splitlines()
        for part in parts:
            if part.startswith(""Audio:""):
                audio = part.split("":"", 1)[1].strip().strip(""'"")
                speak_text(audio)
            elif part.startswith(""Text:""):
                text = part.split("":"", 1)[1].strip().strip(""'"")
                display_text(f""Llama: {text}"")
            elif part.startswith(""Mouse:""):
                mouse_params = part.split("":"", 1)[1].strip().split("","")
                move_mouse(int(mouse_params[0]), int(mouse_params[1]), mouse_params[2].strip())
            elif part.startswith(""Keyboard:""):
                keyboard_params = part.split("":"", 1)[1].strip().split("","")
                handle_keyboard_input(keyboard_params)
    

This function processes the AI’s response, which may include commands for text output, speech, or mouse/keyboard actions.

**3.5. Subprocesses and Threading:**

    pythonCopy codequeue_thread = threading.Thread(target=process_queue)
    queue_thread.start()
    

This line initializes the queue processing in a separate thread, ensuring that the GUI remains responsive while the AI handles inputs.

**4. New Features in Gadget1.0:** Several new features have been implemented to enhance the system's flexibility and usability:

* **Keyboard Input Management:** The system can now simulate key presses and releases, allowing the AI to interact with software or games in a more human-like manner.
* **Session Saving and Loading:** The system can save and load sessions, enabling continuity in user interactions across different sessions.
* **Delta Time Management:** A delta time sleep mechanism ensures smoother operations and prevents the system from becoming unresponsive.

**5. Conclusion:** Gadget1.0 represents a significant step forward in integrating AI into multi-modal interaction systems. Its modular design, coupled with robust queue management and threading, ensures that it can handle a variety of inputs and outputs without sacrificing responsiveness. The system’s ability to simulate key presses, manage sessions, and handle audio/text inputs makes it a powerful tool for research, automation, and AI-driven applications.

1ew0853,1,2024-08-19,Idea for a language learning app - looking for feedback,u/Ill-Music5400,languagelearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/1ew0853/idea_for_a_language_learning_app_looking_for/,"TLDR: A daily AI language tutor - A very focused version of chat GPT that gives you specific information on a topic and then you interact with it about that topic to practice some key words. 

Hi all, I am a former language teacher and language learner and as a learner the biggest problem that I have is learning vocabulary. Of course I learn it but I do not use it enough and then forget it. 

When I was a teacher I put together worksheets for my students who wanted to expand vocabulary - they were based on popular news articles and we would highlight some key vocabulary for the student to practice - for example 

**Article -** 5 Steps to Effective Problem Solving  
**Key Vocabulary** -  to manage,  to discuss**,**  to come up with**,** to evaluate, to estimate, evaluation**,** to recognize**,** to identify, to examine, to determine, define etc.

**Talking points**

1. Identify the problem 
2. Break the problem down
3. Generate potential solutions

  
My idea would be to turn this into a chatbot like ChatGPT that work in the following way

* every day there can be a new lesson
* the chatbot will tell you the topic of the day and the key vocabulary that you are learning / practicing. 
* the chatbot would give you some information about the topic using the key vocabulary
* the chatbot would then ask you some simple questions on each of the talking points where you are expected to use the key vocabulary in the response e.g ""How do you identify problems at work""
* goal is for the student to use all the key vocab, ideally more than once in the responses.

I have a few hundred of these worksheets I can turn into lesson and completing them all would give you all of the vocabulary needed to speak at a good B1 level. 

Some additions to the basic idea would be

* student recording an audio of their responses and posting it in a Telegram/Whatsapp group etc for accountability
* Hard mode - once the student has taken the lesson once they can take the lesson again but the bot will only give them the key vocabulary in their native language. 

  
Obviously there are lots of ways to improve but they key idea is a daily tutor that lets you learn and practice a wide spread of vocabulary - would love to hear your thoughts."

1ewnnku,1,2024-08-20,Hello and Help! Prerequisites topics to survive Calc 1 as a freshman,u/100TheCoolest17,learnmath,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/comments/1ewnnku/hello_and_help_prerequisites_topics_to_survive/,"Hi everyone I'm (20F) a first year engineering student and unfortunately, like many I was a victim of the pandemic. My school years from grade 10-12 were all held online even after IRL Classes started (I even took a gap year to work part time and save up. So you can imagine my mind has been left blank for 4 straight years with my 3 years of online classes comprising of copypasting from ChatGPT)

and because of that I've trying to learn the topics needed for Calc 1 but since I don't have a proper curriculum/study plan. I've been jumping from Algebra to PreCal to Algebra, its been really really messy. I still chose an engineering program even in my situation because I really really love working with hardware and I want to make a career out of it!! I don't want my carelessness that'a coming to bite me in the ass to kill my dream

So I'd like if anyone can help and tell me what topics I need to survive Calc 1?"
1ewwaww,83,2024-08-20,AI Cheating Is Getting Worse,u/theatlantic,ArtificialInteligence,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1ewwaww/ai_cheating_is_getting_worse/,"Ian Bogost: “Kyle Jensen, the director of Arizona State University’s writing programs, is gearing up for the fall semester. The responsibility is enormous: Each year, 23,000 students take writing courses under his oversight. The teachers’ work is even harder today than it was a few years ago, thanks to AI tools that can generate competent college papers in a matter of seconds. [~https://theatln.tc/fwUCUM98~](https://theatln.tc/fwUCUM98) 

“A mere week after ChatGPT appeared in November 2022, The Atlantic declared that ‘The College Essay Is Dead.’ Two school years later, Jensen is done with mourning and ready to move on. The tall, affable English professor co-runs a National Endowment for the Humanities–funded project on generative-AI literacy for humanities instructors, and he has been incorporating large language models into ASU’s English courses. Jensen is one of a new breed of faculty who want to embrace generative AI even as they also seek to control its temptations. He believes strongly in the value of traditional writing but also in the potential of AI to facilitate education in a new way—in ASU’s case, one that improves access to higher education.

“But his vision must overcome a stark reality on college campuses. The first year of AI college ended in ruin, as students tested the technology’s limits and faculty were caught off guard. Cheating was widespread. Tools for identifying computer-written essays proved insufficient to the task. Academic-integrity boards realized they couldn’t fairly adjudicate uncertain cases: Students who used AI for legitimate reasons, or even just consulted grammar-checking software, were being labeled as cheats. So faculty asked their students not to use AI, or at least to say so when they did, and hoped that might be enough. It wasn’t.

“Now, at the start of the third year of AI college, the problem seems as intractable as ever. When I asked Jensen how the more than 150 instructors who teach ASU writing classes were preparing for the new term, he went immediately to their worries over cheating … ChatGPT arrived at a vulnerable moment on college campuses, when instructors were still reeling from the coronavirus pandemic. Their schools’ response—mostly to rely on honor codes to discourage misconduct—sort of worked in 2023, Jensen said, but it will no longer be enough: ‘As I look at ASU and other universities, there is now a desire for a coherent plan.’”

Fifth year ELA/SS teacher here.

It's PD week in our district. Today, we spent the day gathered as a faculty to review policy and whatnot. One of our AP's got up and flipped to a slide titled ""Student Feedback."" 

Homeboy then proceeds to tell a story from when he was in high school. He wanted more than anything to be an NFL quarterback.  If that didn't work out, he was thinking he'd become a doctor, so he signed up for medical terminology. The teacher was a young woman in her first year, he said.

When it came time for the final, this admin wrote a song with coded lyrics, which he then sang during the exam so his football buddies would do well, too. Apparently the teacher wasn't as naive as he thought, because he got a zero for cheating. 

He then proceeded to tell us that he had no idea singing out answers was cheating because the teacher nEvER SeT ThAt ExPecTatIon. He decided then and there that he would not be a doctor--the teacher crushed his spirit and the medical field lost out on his talent because of her  lack of compassion for him and his buddies 🏈

We were then counseled to try and do a better job of SeTtInG ExPeCTaTiOns on individual assignments and that if instances of academic dishonesty did arise, to reflect on to what degree WE may be responsible for the student's behavior. After all, WE are the professionals designing instruction, so clearly, we did something wrong when a student(s) decide to copy and paste from Google, use ChatGPT, etc.

I am/was flabbergasted. Am I wrong in categorizing this as BS? "

As you can see, the AI couldn't even stick to just assignment types - it also generated assignment elements that AI struggles to reproduce. 

Having queried the AI extensively, it seems that what AI struggles with the most is contextual adaptation, synthesis of information across sources and disciplines (also known as cross transference), and personalization (emotional depth). 

What would know better than an LLM what AI most struggles with? I figured I might as well ask it. And when I read through the list, I realized I already used several elements (again, it confused types and elements) in assignments that AI struggles to reproduce. We probably all do.

Maybe we can leverage AI to teach us how to get around the workarounds that students have found in order to design AI-proof assignments. I mean, we've all been using workarounds for student workarounds in other mediums for years. This is just the current version of an age-old problem. "

1exvd32,13,2024-08-21,I thought of a new way to teach vocabulary,u/arbel03,ESL_Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/ESL_Teachers/comments/1exvd32/i_thought_of_a_new_way_to_teach_vocabulary/,"Hello teachers! 

I recently thought about a way to teach vocabulary. 

These days there are many flashcards / repetitive memorization tools such as quiziz, quizlet, anki pro, etc...

The problem is that they all display the same ""question"" / ""flashcard"", which can be really boring and prone to students copying answers from one another.

AI creates brand new opportunities in this field. For example, here is a prompt which I gave Claude, and it's answer. You can see it created 4 questions for the same answer:

\`\`\`  
Create an English Vocabulary test for 10th grade ESL students about the word ""Environment"". The answer for all the questions should be ""Environment"". Include 2 Single-Choice questions and 2 Complete the sentence questions. The answers themselves should be simplified to the level of a 10th grader, and match their knowledge. Here is the test:



Here is an English Vocabulary test about the word ""Environment"" for 10th grade ESL students:

Single-Choice Questions:

1. The place where a person, animal, or plant lives is called the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. a. System b. Weather c. Environment d. Climate
2. The things around us, both living and non-living, that we interact with is called the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. a. Sea b. Sand c. Space d. Environment

Complete the Sentence Questions:

1. The \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ includes all the natural things like air, water, and land that living things need to survive.
2. Keeping the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ clean and healthy is important for all living things.

Answer Key:

1. c. Environment
2. d. Environment
3. Environment
4. Environment

\`\`\`

Let's say we create one personalized question per each student in our classroom using AI. We can adjust the difficulty of the question by adjusting our prompt, and I believe we can track our student's growth and classroom knowledge more efficiently and accurately using this method.

I created a survey on google forms to test this and I will be happy if you can take a few minutes to fill it here: [https://forms.gle/9xxUNBAA8uGsXdbx6](https://forms.gle/9xxUNBAA8uGsXdbx6)"
1ey0d84,1,2024-08-21,Need Advice for Career Goals,u/figaro_cat,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ey0d84/need_advice_for_career_goals/,"I graduated from university in 2018 with a Bachelor of Arts in International Development Studies. I had made the mistake of not really researching the local job market before choosing my major. Since I like outside the national capital, there are very few jobs in Canada in my field. Since graduation, I have dabbled in teaching ESL to try to find a career path for going abroad. I worked for a year and a half and saved up enough money to spend \~10 months abroad. But I came back with a drained bank account and problems re-adjusting to living in Canada.

That was three years ago and I have been unemployed since. I have been trying to think of a pathway for eventually going abroad again, since that is what makes me truly happy. (i.e. having deep, life-changing cross-cultural conversations with people of all sorts and exploring really old and interesting places) I have been consulting different career counsellors and I eventually came up with a plan to get into curriculum development. The problem is that I found out I couldn't make it as an ESL teacher (too shy and softspoken) and the curriculum job required a Bachelor of Education and likely working as a teacher for a period of time. As a result, I'm not interested in that anymore.

I am currently trying to decide between two options:

1) A Bachelor of Social Work - This is another back up plan. Except I don't even know if this would allow me to go abroad. There are lots of jobs locally for this so I wouldn't be in the same situation upon graduation with more education. I'm not sure my heart is in it but the courses seem easy and I know I would do well.

2) A Bachelor of Arts in Psychology - If I didn't have to worry about money and didn't fear failure, I would choose this option. I choose International Development because it allowed me to study all the different subjects that interested me. But there was an idea for graduate studies that has stuck with me that I would be really disappointed if I couldn't pursue at some point in my life.

My problem is that I only have about two years of coverage left in student loans and would need to know for sure I could work at the end of the bachelors, with the intention of saving money to do graduate studies. (I currently live at home with my mom and sister and am unemployed. I volunteer helping newcomers find resources and edit their resumes and cover letters.)

I asked chatgpt what I could do locally with International Development/Psychology and I got the following: Community Development Worker, Program Coordinator for the Non-Profit Sector, Policy Analyst or Researcher, Research and Evaluation Specialist, and Newcomer Support Worker.

My research idea has to do with whether the ability to exploit others for financial gain is a learned or inherent human behaviour. I plan to experiment with children during my masters and with adults for a phd, if I get that far. I have pitched my idea to people of different educational and cultural backgrounds and they have all told me that I could have an excellent career. (I just don't believe in myself.)

Would someone mind talking things out with me? I would greatly appreciate it."
1ey25fl,1,2024-08-21,Not so scared of ChatGPT now,u/journoprof,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1ey25fl/not_so_scared_of_chatgpt_now/,"Needing tons of questions to build large item banks, I set up a ChatGPT account to help. We're suppose to be taking advantage of AI to teach better, you know?

I kept it simple: Say, 10 sentences following a specific style guide's rule. It worked OK ... for the first and second sets of questions. Then it seemed to make up its own rules. Finally, I just had it generate raw material, such as 10 sentences including ages, and adjusted them to fit the style guide. It managed that, with occasional hiccups.

Language is tough. So instead I had it generate sets of word problems with whole-number answers for things such as mean and median averages. It even showed its work, and the final calculations were fine.

I had students beta test with random questions. Every student who got one of the math problems was marked wrong on at least one answer.

Suspicious, I took one of the word problems and fed it back into ChatGPT. This time, it generated answers that weren't whole numbers. Thinking perhaps I had mistyped when I entered the questions into my quiz, I fiddled with the numbers until ChatGPT said I was back to whole numbers. Great!

Only, as I was changing the question and answers, I realized the AI said the mean average of a set of numbers was lower than all the numbers in the set. This seemed unlikely. The error was in the most basic math: when it added up the seven numbers in the set, it got an answer that was wrong in two of the three digits. (Did the division after that jim-dandy, though.) Upon further review, it had screwed up almost every word problem's math in some way.

It seems ChatGPT is terrible at simple tasks. And the one student I dinged in a previous course for using AI was embarrassingly easy to catch -- bizarre citations, a fictitious central incident, etc. Are the current fears about AI in education overblown? Is it really sneaking through? It may be OK at knowing 2+2=4, but it thought 22+25+22+29+24+25+22=147.

1ey9k6j,1,2024-08-21,How to box out money chasers. ,u/Stock_Store_7585,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/1ey9k6j/how_to_box_out_money_chasers/,"We have all encountered money chasers our schools. People who choose  CS for the money and nothing more. No passion for computers, algorithms, programming, technologies, etc. They use ChatGPT for EVERY single assignment they get, make zero projects on their free time, cheat off all exams, and overall have no interest in computer science. Throughout my career I’ve only encountered a small handful of people who truly had a love for computer science. It’s really discouraging to continue studying this field when most of the students are only in it for the money. 

So here’s the question. How do you guys box these people out of your thoughts? Its so hard for me learn new frameworks and technologies 
when most of my peers could care less about learning anything. Kinda gives the CS field a bad reputation. I feel the field isn’t as prestigious as it once was. "
1ey9wdr,9,2024-08-21,Learn anything with this prompt chain to build a course for any subject. Prompt included.,u/CalendarVarious3992,ChatGPTCoding,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTCoding/comments/1ey9wdr/learn_anything_with_this_prompt_chain_to_build_a/,"Helloo  
  
Here's a neat prompt chain for being able to generate a course for any subject. Great for self-teaching any subject or getting a high-level view of what it might look to learn a specific subject.

**Prompt Chain**

`Define the course parameters: SUBJECT=[subject name], AUDIENCE=[target audience], DURATION=[course length in weeks]~Create a course outline with main modules, each focusing on a key aspect of the subject~For each module, list 3-5 specific learning objectives that align with the overall course goals~Develop a detailed syllabus including module titles, topics covered, estimated time for completion, and required materials~Create an introduction module that explains the course structure, expectations, and provides an overview of the subject~For Module 1, design a lesson plan with lecture content, practical exercises, and multimedia resources~Develop assessment methods for Module 1, including quizzes, assignments, or projects that test the module's learning objectives~Repeat the lesson plan and assessment development process for the next half of the modules~Create interactive elements for each module, such as discussion prompts, group activities, or hands-on projects~Design a mid-course project or assignment that integrates concepts from the first half of the course~Develop lesson plans and assessments for the remaining modules, incorporating more advanced concepts and building on earlier modules~Create a final project or exam that comprehensively assesses the entire course content~Develop a resource list including textbooks, online materials, and supplementary reading for each module~Create a glossary of key terms and concepts covered throughout the course~Design a feedback mechanism for students to evaluate the course and suggest improvements~Develop a guide for instructors, including teaching tips, common student challenges, and suggested solutions~Create a course completion certificate template and criteria for earning the certificate`

Make sure you update the variable in the first prompt, SUBJECT, AUDIENCE, and DURATION and then you can pass this prompt chain into [ChatGPT Queue](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/chatgpt-queue-save-time-w/iabnajjakkfbclflgaghociafnjclbem?hl=en&authuser=0) extension and it will just run autonomously. Would love to hear what course you build."
1ez6u5x,1,2024-08-23,"Advice needed: School that is 5 minutes away by foot, has friends and feels like home but terrible teachers with average grades or school that is 1.5 hours away with public transportation with good grades, excellent teachers but no social life?",u/AbandonedStark,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ez6u5x/advice_needed_school_that_is_5_minutes_away_by/,"I have 2 years of highschool that I’ll be doing the German Abitur (university entrance exam). In my previous school, I was close with all my classmates and the school is only 5 minutes away by foot, so I had almost no stress and found free time for my hobbies, sports and future plans. 
What threw me off were the teachers, I’m the only non German kid left in class (all foreigners left by the middle of the year because they couldn’t take the racism no more) and unfortunately we have a few teachers that are highly conservative and racist, who grade me very badly even though I get better results than my other classmates and never ever pick me in class or let me speak, and sometimes make me wait outside of the class until the lesson ends. There have been days where I came home sobbing because of the mobbing from the teachers. My grades at that school were therefore average, which is very bad for me since I was an excellent student before coming to that school.

So I changed my school to another city which is 1.5 hours away, I have to travel with bus and train and have to get up at 5.30 everyday. It’s very stressful and I never have time for sports nor hobbies. The social environment is also the opposite of my old school. No one speaks with each other and no one seems to be friends, and the few people I tried to speak with avoided me. I’m a very social person too.

However, the teachers at this school are excellent, and I feel like I could get better grades here (If I worked hard of course.) 

About my goals, I have less desire to study and more desire to start my own business and be an entrepreneur. I already have a business plan, did my research about the demand and supply and the current market, how to finance and I was hoping to get all my documents and permissions done by the end of the highschool so I can start my business right after I graduate. My parents however have a different plan for me. They want me so study and get to an excellent university and work at a safe job “without risk”, maybe I could do that for a few years but I’d hate my life if I had to do that my whole career. I also can’t plan ahead for my business like I wanted to if I be this stressed  all year round. Although I don’t want to disappoint my parents either. 

So what do I do? I don’t know if it’s worth all this stress and no free time for the grades I don’t even need for my ultimate goal. I can get into a university either way but don’t know if it’s worth to get into an excellent one my parents want and sacrifice my time for it. My parents of course advise me to stay in the far away school but chatgpt advises me to go back to my old school. 

Thank you so much for reading and I hope for a few advices! "
1ezl15f,36,2024-08-23,TOEFL preparation strategy ,u/paglaulta,ToeflAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/ToeflAdvice/comments/1ezl15f/toefl_preparation_strategy/,"
Hello everyone, I would like to share my preparation strategy with you all. I would like to begin by saying that I am not a native English speaker, and I am also a slow learner, so it took me a month to prepare for the TOEFL. However, the preparation time may vary from person to person depending on their proficiency in English.
I only used the following resources for the TOEFL preparation:
1. Official Guide to the TOEFL iBT Test (7th edition)
2. TST prep videos
3. Elsa speech analyzer

In my opinion, the official guide was the most beneficial resource because it provided insights into how test graders evaluate responses and included sample tests in each section, along with explanations for correct and incorrect answers. Additionally, it offered four full practice tests at the end, which was more cost-effective compared to purchasing them directly from the ETS website. If you are interested, feel free to send me a direct message, and I can provide you with the contact information of an individual from whom I obtained the guide at a significantly reduced price.

Here are my strategies for each of the sections.

## Reading 📖
In the reading section, effective time management is essential. A strategy that proved successful for me was prioritizing the question before examining the choices. I would begin by reading the passage title to gain an understanding of the content. My primary advice for this section is to read with the intention of comprehension. When we engage with interesting material, we not only enhance our focus but also retain intricate details. This approach prevents repetitive reading of the same lines. Additionally, familiarizing ourselves with the question and options beforehand aids in comprehension. I would like to share my approach to each question type.

1. Factual Info
This is the most prevalent type. For this question, I kindly suggest not overthinking the answer, as it is either explicitly stated in the paragraph or simply rephrased.

2. Negative Factual Info
For this question, you can use the process of elimination. Simply identify and eliminate the options that are already mentioned in the paragraph. This will eventually leave you with the correct answer, which may not be explicitly stated in the paragraph or may contradict what is already stated.

3. Vocabulary Questions
For this, I kindly suggest reviewing Magoosh's TOEFL English Vocabulary Cards. Additionally, pay close attention to the context in which the words are used, as the question does not ask for the direct meaning, but rather for the word that is closest to the given word. If you are unfamiliar with a word, eliminate options that you know are incorrect and substitute the word in the sentence to see if it makes sense.

4. Reference Questions
These are quite simple and uncommon. To answer this, simply read the sentence in which the word occurs. If not, read the sentence before that, and the answer is usually in these sentences. Reference questions typically ask you about a specific phenomenon that occurs or directly refer to a place. Here, again, substitute the highlighted word or words and see if it makes grammatical sense.

5. Sentence Simplification Questions
To find the answer, begin by eliminating options that are illogical or omit crucial details. Then, try rephrasing the question in your own words. Keep in mind that the correct response should be a paraphrase that emphasizes key information without contradicting the original text.

6. Inference Questions
This question is indeed challenging for me to address. To approach this question effectively, it would be beneficial to examine the initial sentences of the passage. The author typically begins by presenting a point, followed by an example that serves to reinforce the aforementioned point.

7. Rhetorical Purpose Questions 
In this question, we are asked to understand why the author mentions something, rather than focusing on factual information. To approach this question effectively, let's begin by reading the two sentences preceding the highlighted question. Our goal is to comprehend the logical flow between these sentences and gain a deeper understanding of the author's intent.

8. Insert Text Questions 
It is quite simple to comprehend once you grasp the logical progression. To address this, simply replace the text and read the sentences that come before and after it. Do they make logical sense? If not, then that is not the solution.

9. Prose Summary Questions 
This is indeed the most challenging question, but it becomes quite manageable once you grasp the technique to answer it. My approach was to jot down the main idea of each passage in a word or two while reading the passages. This allowed me to swiftly locate the relevant information within the paragraph. One common mistake I made was attempting to read the entire paragraphs from the beginning. As mentioned earlier, if you read with the intention of understanding, you will not need to revisit the text repeatedly. It is crucial to recognize that the question seeks the main ideas of the passage. Although certain points may be mentioned in the passage, they serve merely as supporting arguments and examples and do not contribute to expressing the overall idea. The most effective approach to answering this question is to select the options that you believe are correct and then verify them against the passage. Ask yourself whether they convey the main idea or are simply supporting evidence. If the option is not mentioned at all or contradicts a sentence, you can eliminate it.

This concludes the reading strategy. Please remember to read with the intention of understanding, as if you are reading your favorite manga or a series that you enjoy. Additionally, jot down the main points of each passage, as this will assist you in answering the final question. Avoid overthinking, as you can always return for a review later.

## Listening 🦻
Here are some tips that might be helpful:
- Listen with the intent to understand the conversation, not to answer questions.
- Take notes, but don't try to write down everything. Use abbreviations instead of writing whole words.
- Pay attention to the main idea of the conversation or lecture.
- Don't worry about the different types of questions. Just listen and note important points and examples.
- I used short forms such as S and T to represent the student and teacher

## Speaking
Here comes the most challenging aspect. I am not accustomed to speaking English regularly, as I am an introvert. Nevertheless, the most valuable advice I can offer is to comprehend how the system and the human raters will evaluate you. The three criteria are: Language, Delivery, and Topic Development. Language refers to how you employ grammar to convey ideas. It is crucial that your sentences are grammatically sound, and you are capable of forming complex sentences. One suggestion is to combine sentences using 'because' or any conjunction rather than constructing short sentences. For instance, instead of stating, ""I did not go to the library. I had to finish my project at home,"" you could say, ""I did not go to the library because I had to finish my project at home.""
The system considers this as a complex sentence and also enhances your Delivery. Regarding Delivery, the most crucial aspect is your sustained speech. It evaluates your ability to maintain your speaking for an extended period. Can you speak without using filler words and maintain a consistent pace throughout the speaking time? Concentrate on your pronunciation, intonation, and strive to sound natural. It is essential to appear genuine. Avoid faking an accent or attempting to speak too loudly, as this will not only slow you down but also hinder your ability to perform well. Although I have an Indian accent, my speech is clear, and the examiner can comprehend what I am saying without difficulty. As for topic development, ensure that you adhere to the structure that I will share with you now.

### Independent speaking 
For this practice on a wide range of topics, I kindly request ChatGPT to provide me with a list of questions and engage in a conversation. It is crucial to maintain a continuous flow of speech and time oneself to enhance fluency. Initially, the mind may go blank, but consistent practice will help overcome this challenge.

I suggest starting with creating stories related to personal experiences, such as hobbies, acquired skills, or favorite places. These can then be applied to different scenarios. It is important to remember that there are no right or wrong answers, and even if an example is not entirely accurate, the examiners are generally understanding.

For those who lack friends to practice speaking with, ChatGPT can be a valuable tool. By engaging in voice conversations and requesting questions and feedback, one can improve their speaking skills effectively.

In my personal opinion[my opinion]. I believe so because[why I believe so]. First, [give a reason]. For instance [give example]. Second, [give a reason]. For example/As an illustration [give example]. In conclusion [if you have time to conclude]

It is perfectly acceptable to provide either a single reason and example or two reasons followed by two examples, whichever you find most appropriate. Personally, I opted for just one reason and an example. A conclusion is not necessary.

### Integrated task 2
Here you will be given a notice about a change on campus or a proposal. Jot down the modifications being implemented along with the justifications provided. Subsequently, simply record the reasons for the other person's agreement or disagreement, along with the two points they raise.

My template:
The reading is about a change on campus. It discusses the university's decision [decision]. The reason behind this is stated that.... (if change suggested by administration)
The letter proposes a change on campus. It suggests [suggestion]. The rationale behind this is that...... (if suggested by a person)
The man in the conversation disagrees/supports this change. He raises his concern by stating that/He appreciates the university's initiative by stating that...
First, he starts off by saying that....
Additionally, he points out that....
Moreover, he mentions that....
In conclusion, the man voices his concern/shows his encouragement (if you have time for conclusion)


### Integrated task 3
In this you will read a definition about a topic, and then listen to a lecture about the same topic with an example. Jot down the topic name and its definition and what causes it in the reading. And then the example given by the lecturer.

My template:
According to the reading [topic] is [topic definition]. The professor further elaborates on this topic by taking an example. He starts of by saying that [what he says]. Furthermore he states that [what does he state]

### Integrated task 4
In this section, you will only be listening to a lecture and then speaking. The lecturer will always provide two examples about a topic after a brief discussion. You may choose to explain the topic followed by the definitions, or simply provide the two definitions with examples. I opted to provide the two definitions with examples.

My template: 
The professor discusses about the two different kinds/types/classification [of whatever]
First he mentions that... He illustrates this with the help of an example [example]
In contrast (since the other definition will always contrast), [define the topic]. For instance [example]

It is crucial to be confident, speak naturally, and use proper pronunciation. Occasional stumbles are acceptable, but it is advisable to avoid using filler words like ""umm"" and ""uhh"" as the system can detect them. Despite experiencing some difficulties and being unable to complete Task 3, I still managed to achieve a perfect score. Even ETS acknowledges that minor errors can get you a perfect score.

## WRITING
For this section, it is crucial to minimize typos and avoid excessive repetition of words. Paraphrasing is highly encouraged, as directly copying from the reading passage will negatively impact your scores. Additionally, working on your typing speed would be beneficial. A good target would be 60 words per minute. Make sure to allocate at least three minutes to review your answers for the first task and two minutes for the second task. While the word count is not a primary concern, ensure that you meet the minimum word limit. I went overboard and wrote a 300+  and 180+ in the two sections. 

My template for writing task 1:
Here I wrote an intro followed by 3 paragraphs. In each argument, I provide a summary of the author's position and the lecturer's counterarguments.

Intro
The reading and the lecture discuss about [whats the topic]
While the author presents three explanations about [about the topic], the lecturer however challenges each of these claims.

Body1
First, the author argues that [his point]. In contrast, the lecturer contends this by stating that [what he states]

Body2
Second, the author suggests that [his point]. The lecturer opposes this. He starts off by saying that [his argument]

Body3
Finally, the author claims [his point]. On the other hand, the lecturer refutes this claim. According to him [his point]

To add info use : Additionally, Furthermore, Moreover 
To give an example use: For example, For instance, As an illustration, Such as
To oppose: Refute, Challenge, Contend, Conversely 
To show effect use: Hence, Therefore, As a result 
To summarize use: In conclusion, To sum up, In summary

My template for writing task 2:
Here, I would lpresent my perspective and the reasoning behind it. Subsequently, I would express my agreement with one of the statements while adding my own viewpoint. Conversely, I would disagree with the other statement and provide my reasons for doing so.

In my personal opinion [my opinion]. I believe that [reason]. I agree with Peter's argument that [his argument paraphrased]. I would like to add that [my point]. Although  Claire raises a valid argument [her argument], however it's important to note thay [my reason challenging her]

Pro tip:
If you, like me, have difficulty speaking in noisy environments, I have a suggestion that may be helpful. I discovered that in the examination center, it is not necessary to begin reading immediately. When I arrived and sat down with everyone else, I simply remained seated in the reading section for approximately 20 minutes. By the time I reached my speaking section, most of the other examinees had either completed their exams or had moved on to the writing section. This allowed me to speak without being distracted by the noise.

And speaking of distractions, my testing experience was the worst as there was ongoing construction with constant drilling noises and no noise-canceling headphones were provided. So if possible, try to opt for the home edition or ensure you book a test center with adequate equipment. I wish ETS would check the quality of the centers, as it is quite expensive. A friend of mine had to retake the exam due to similar issues. Alternatively, consider taking the IELTS exam, as their testing experience is better, and you actually converse with a human during the speaking section.

I hope this is helpful. I wish everyone who is preparing the best of luck. May you all achieve your desired scores. 🎉 ^^"

I am currently learning on what make a code clean and well-designed by reading the following books: 

* *Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship* by Robert C. Martin.
*  *Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code* by Martin Fowler.
*  *Refactoring for Software Design Smells: Managing Technical Debt* by Girish Suryanarayana, Ganesh Samarthyam, and Tushar Sharma.

And once I am done with them hopefully I will have a better understanding and how to write a better code, but as I am learning I noticed that there are things that can will need to understand the meaning of the code and what functionality it does, and this is where AI come in.

I don't have knowledge on how AI and LLM really work, so what can you guys advice me on my journey to build such tool, and do you think such tool can be built only using some LLM API like ChatGPT and a very good prompt and that's it, or thing llike this require more than a LLM with good prompt?

In the pilot scheme at David Game College starting in September, 20 students who are about 15 years of age will use AI tools for a year before taking their GCSE exams. The subjects will include English, mathematics, biology, chemistry, and computer science.

Well, people have joked about it for years. It is finally happening. Teachers are being replaced with computers.

I figured this puts us about 10 years away from skynet taking over and us having to fight the robots. Unfortunately, the youth of the world will be absolutely in love with the terminators that are trying to exterminate us. All hail John Connor!

I would love your opinions about using Gen AI to check handwritten tests. 

I am an software developer with a passion for AI. My wife is an English teacher that has to check handwritten tests on a regular basis. 

Of course ChatGPT could already reliably check closed questions if you'd give it the answers as well. Also checking open questions is not a problem for ChatGPT anymore. The problem was the handwriting. Even the best OCR models could not reliable read handwriting. Until now.

Recently I think I cracked that problem and I am now able to reliably read some of the worst handwritings. So last week I created a simple working website as a proof of concept where you:

1. upload the test questions (as text or pictures)

2. upload the answer keys (or have ChatGPT generate the answer keys automatically from the questions)

3. use a custom webpage on your phone to take a picture of each test page and upload them to the main website with a single button. So you can just click, click, click away all pages as easy and fast as possible. Some Xerox machines als support scanning in bulk which could also work. ChatGPT automatically extracts the names of the students from the pictures if the students name is present. So you wouldn't have to manually enter all students.

4. Have ChatGPT generate a report per student listing the right and wrong answers including detailed explanations.

  
This would work for any text based test, in any language, not only for languages. Subjects like history, geography would work equally well in the exact same way. The whole process would take no longer then 15 minutes for a class of 30 students handing in 2-3 pages each. As far as I can tell something like this does not exist yet for handwritten tests. 

  
If you made all the way through my post, thanks and leave a comment."

There was a lot of useful discussion between different people and with that feedback and reflection I came up with a new idea. I would like your opinion on this, could it work?

-----

When I was but a wee boy I wanted to become an archaeologist or a wildlife photographer. I spend a lot of free time reading books and looking at pictures and drawings of animals and dinosaurs. When I got older, around the age of 12, this slowly started to fade away. I never lost interest but I started to realise that these kinds of work fields are pretty hard to get into and that it isnt all as romantic as I had it in my head. I still wanted to learn more about these topics, but I never pursued them as I was too busy with school and friends and all the drama that happens around that time in most teenagers life. I ended up doing a business/manager focused study where I felt out of place. I just did it because all the rest seemed even more outside my scope. I finished it because it wasnt hard, but I was never passionate about it. After my studies I ended up in an office doing things that were not at all related to anything I had studied for the 10 years prior.

This story is something I think many people are familiar with and have experienced. How many of you remember any of the things you were forced to learn in highschool? Pretty much nothing for me. It helped me develop some writing skills and reading skills but I would have had those as well if I was learning about topics I actually enjoyed. This is not just archaeology or any kids dream jobs, but topics like wildlife conservation, history, engineering, creative writing, psychology and politics were all things I would have loved to have delved into over many of the topics that we did get. Some of these were explored in certain classes, especially history, but they never really sparked my interest due to how it was taught. 

Queue the reason why I tell you all of this: A new teaching/learning methodology. 

Imagine the following. You are 12 years old, just entered a new school and you get the freedom to pick 4 topics of your interest to learn about. You get a week to pick them. If you cant come up with something the school will provide you with 100's to pick from. It could be anything. Additionally you get 5 topics everyone has to do which would be the essentials (language, national history, math, a computer class and a topics class.) The topics class I imagine is where older students or teachers give a lesson about any topic that they are engaged in, exposing students to a variety of topics and spark new interests.

Now that you have picked your 4 topics you will be deep diving into them for 3 months. You get to write a short essay about why you like certain topics and what makes you interestedin them most. An educator (teacher) will generate a curriculum privately for you to delve into using an LLM. He will give you assignments to complete on these topics. LLM's are encouraged to use but students will have to include the sources of their information if they choose to use it. Using LLM's as a source of feedback and learning the students will enjoy engaging themselves in a topic. In the end students will be given oral examinations and give presentations which focus on argumentation and fact checking. The end result will be a grade that is not a number, but rather ""Insufficient, Sufficient or Excellent.""

So why all this? I believe that middle and highschool has so much more potential as a learning medium than it is now. As it stands students are forced to learn on topics they do not find interesting. It is demotivating. Students can learn key writing, reading and thinking skills in much more engaging way, learning more along the way if they get to explore topics that motivate them intrinsically. 

I think with the current state of ChatGPT Plus it would already be viable, but if there was an LLM focused on education and made specifically to cater to this methodology then it could be better and safer. As a side note, the importance of sourcing, fact checking should be underlined in every assignment and also taken serious by educators when providing feedback."

Hey everyone  

I will not pretend that I am in some grave situation since things could be a ton worse but I am grateful for my life. This is just me venting here and needing some wise words or a direction / advice to what I can do since I am feeling pretty stuck at the moment. Firstly, I am a computer engineering student in a university in canada going into my 4th year. I am a 20 year old guy. As you probably know, the market is terrible right now. Extremely terrible. Now, what I have been going into (one of my many mistakes that I will discuss in this very long post) is a mix of different directions. I have not really stuck to anything which is a mistake on my part. I quickly lost interest in many things. I tried a lot of courses (eg harvard’s cs50p python course (thankfully completed it), the complete 2024 web developer bootcamp by angela yu (didn’t complete it), 100 days of python bootcamp (didn’t complete it)) and a ton of tutorials. The thing is, I am not good at all in anything I’ve tried. I’ve also tried AI… everyone tells you it should be a field you look into… I thought some aspects are pretty cool, like being able to create your own model, train it, etc etc… I tried getting books only to find cryptic symbols and diagrams in every single page of it.I ended up going to my very first conference and met an ai engineer who works in amazon. He told me the field of AI and machine learning is more math than actual coding. I had a feeling that was the case but that didn’t exactly encourage me to pursue the field further, as it seemed to be a whole different world full of things that I’m not so passionate about. I am also a perfectionist (ironic since I really am not good at anything I’ve done, I cannot even start a project on my own. Except lousy number guessing games and those that courses encourage you to do). I want to be the best at what I do, I really do, and I know a ton of work and practice will go into trying to make that dream a reality, which makes me know I have to have some passion or at least not dislike what I’m doing. So I thought AI and machine learning wouldn’t be the best fields for me.

Fast forward a bit, I met a guy in university who seemed to be a genius. Anywhere I’ve seen him, he’d be coding. He told me I should try backend coding and work with him. Long story short, he meant FOR him, for free, doing projects that he wants done, and getting nothing in return, no money no recognition, and it ends up being called his project whereas I spent long nights till 4 am coding for him (or in my case using chatgpt, another mistake of mine since I feel like an imposter, but the guy had unrealistic expectations for me, telling me I should just ‘learn’ everything he wants me to do and give him results). I knew it was B.S and after many arguments and trying to end things, I ghosted him. Couple of weeks ago he sent an apology, but that’s done now. I realized I want to go into fullstack engineering, not having to rely on anyone (my other friend was also a victim of that scam, he was the frontend guy. The ‘genius’ guy convinced my friend he should go for frontend and I should go for backend. My friend was sometimes slow on getting stuff done, sometimes abandoning things. I knew I should just do things on my own and try to learn it all for myself so I wouldn’t need to depend on anyone at all. The idea seemed appealing then, that I could build any SaaS and become an independent coder who makes money on his own (I was inspired by Marc Lou, poor at first, fired from his job, made 20 something SaaS ideas, a few were successful, most failed. He was known not to be the most impressive (or impressive at all ability wise) but very consistent and hopeful which made his personality resonate with a lot of people and earned him a huge following). That failed too, ended up not continuing learning it. I have been applying for jobs since forever. Last summer I even went as far as applying in pizza places and supermarkets and in the local mall with several copies of my printed cv. No replies. When I would apply to tech companies, it usually ended in me never hearing from the company, other than that it’d be the ‘unfortunately we don’t want you but subscribe to our newsletter to stay updated’ type of email.


I am now genuinely thinking I might be unemployed when I graduate in December of 2025. The only position I’ve gotten is a position in the university to hold some sessions before midterms for some engineering courses for engineering 1st year & 2nd year students, and another was a Research assistant position in a mechanical engineering lab (arduino debugging type of work, I was told I was taken because the professor ‘felt bad’ and wanted to help me, according to him).


What do I do? Also, I’m an arab, and international students pay a lot. Thankfully my parents pay for my tuition, but I feel like I am a huge burden to them. I’ve always thought I would get rich quickly, repay them, even retire them as a much deserved thanks for their incredible work. 

Recently, my father told me to consider cybersecurity. His reasoning was that there are cyberattacks everywhere, so surely the demand must be high by all the companies, and that I might find my passion there since I loved that idea since I was a kid. Now it is true, the whole reason why I joined anything computer related, was because I’d always tell him I wanted to be a hacker. I was a kid, and as silly as it was, I used to think hacking games and things like that was the most interesting thing in the world. It felt like I was outsmarting systems created by much older people, perhaps lazy people but if a kid managed to hack (well, download a hack made by a smart person, not me) I was considering it to be very rewarding. I also thought of it this way. If physical prowess was of extreme importance back then and still is now, with out world moving to become nearly entirely technological, surely technological prowess is priceless too, right? It must be! If you were capable to always defend yourself from any attacks, had the ability and skill level to detect anything suspicious, and to be able to even inflict any damage on those trying to harm you or your family (I had imagined by asking to deal with people trying any phishing tricks or scams by family members and friends, despite knowing nothing about cybersecurity at ALL. I was a kid and saw it as almost a game. A battle, and I wanted to learn eveyrhring about this field to win any battle). 

Fast forward to now, thinking if I should do this. Again, I feel like I would be at this disadvantage, with people taking bachelors for cybersec, so they’d definitely be a lot better than me, making me pretty useless against candidates in this highly competitive field. But then again, I feel I am not good at what I have been aiming for already, so either way I would be starting from a very basic level…

It turns out I also had a TryHackMe account when I was younger (ironically, didn’t complete a single path). I find that out when I kept searching for how someone entirely new could get familiar with things. I also like the fact that it’s a lot different, my field being so focused on advanced problem-solving projects and leetcoding for tech interviews. And cybersec being mostly focused on certificates (i might be wrong). I am now in the phase of not knowing what to do, what to start with, and where to head to. It is overwhelming, maybe also because I’ve been constantly trying to get information about this huge new field that I know nothing about. Different certifications, sec+, network+, oscp, etc and different fields/roles (I find red teame to be the most interesting but apparently blue teamsrs are in much more demand). A lot of concepts are confusing like white hat grey hat black hat and if these are categories of red teamers. And if so what’s the difference between red teamers and pen testers? And also apparently there are an abundance of pen testers… but then I’ve been thinking if I should worry about competition and what’s in most demand and what pays the most since if I’m skilled enough in something, it won’t matter how much in demand it is? I don’t know though. I feel like time is running out since I will be graduating in about a year and a half, with everyone in university landing internships and then there’s me, with nothing.


If you have made it this far, I’d like to sincerely thank you for your time. I hope you can tell me what you think and what you’d do in my situation and if my thinking is wrong about any of the aspects I mentioned"
1f252vv,1,2024-08-26,Students Who Got in Trouble for Using AI Writing,u/gptgabe,stealthgpt,https://www.reddit.com/r/stealthgpt/comments/1f252vv/students_who_got_in_trouble_for_using_ai_writing/,"Read OG post here: [https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/students-who-got-in-trouble-for-using-ai-writing](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/students-who-got-in-trouble-for-using-ai-writing)

It’s ironic, many students have faced harsh consequences for using artificial intelligence in their schoolwork, yet at the highest echelons of our educational institutions, plagiarism seems to run rampant among top tier faculty.

If you've looked into the shifting [ethics of AI and academic integrity](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/is-using-chatgpt-plagiarism-academic-dishonesty-in-dishonest-academia), it only makes sense academia would have trouble embracing a new technology like generative AI. However, students that face harsh consequences for the use of AI today aren’t going to be comforted by the full scale acceptance of the technology in the near future.

I’ve scoured the internet to find tales of students using AI-generated text and getting accused of academic misconduct because of it. These are their stories.

# Students That Got Punished

The most reported of these sad instances is [the story of Marley Stevens](https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/tech/ai/student-fights-academic-probation-ai-tool/), a college student who didn’t even use an AI chatbot to write her essay, she used Grammarly, an AI paraphraser, to proofread it. If you’ve read out [blog post about AI paraphrasers](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/will-an-ai-paraphraser-make-chatgpt-undetectable), not only do you know they’re a flawed AI tool, but you’d know that being accused of academic dishonesty for using one is ridiculous.

Speaking of dishonesty though, if you delve deeper into this story, you learn that not only were her professors advocating for using Grammarly, but the university of North Georgia advocated for it on their own website, later taking down any mention of the software after Stevens’ accusation.

Marley was put in on academic probation that she eventually overcame, but she is far from the only student that encountered academia’s hypocrisy and incompetency around AI tools.

Another case involved multiple students at Yeshiva University that used generative AI like ChatGPT to write their take home finals. The students were caught when their English professor ran their finals through AI detection software and discovered the cheating. In response, the university implemented a whole new AI policy prohibiting the use of AI writing.

Reddit is full of these stories, here’s one below. In it, the student was threatened with possible expulsion but after pleading with faculty, her grade was taken from a zero to a C so she could pass the class.

Even more commonplace than punishment for students using AI writing, is AI detection systems screwing up and delivering false positives that sour college experiences.

# False Positives and Bureaucratic Nightmares

UC Davis student [Louis Stevens](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/student-accused-ai-cheating-turnitin-1234747351/) wrote a paper summarizing a court case for a class and hours after uploading it, not only did Turnitin flag a portion of the essay, but it was immediately forwarded to the Office of Student Support and Judicial Affairs.

After being subjected to an academic integrity review, Stevens learned that the university had just integrated Turnitin which was then spouting a 98% accuracy rate. Even though she proved her innocence, this wasn’t the first case of false positives at UC Davis.

Previously that year, [William Quarterman](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2023/04/12/how-ai-detection-tool-spawned-false-cheating-case-uc-davis/11600777002/) uploaded his history exam to his professor who ran it through GPTZero and after it gave him a false positive, Quarterman was plunged into a bureaucratic nightmare before clearing his name.

These instances are certainly disheartening, but there was one case of false positive AI detection that was so egregious, it was actually funny. This was the case of a [Texas A&M professor that temporarily failed his entire class](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/texas-am-chatgpt-ai-professor-flunks-students-false-claims-1234736601/) after he ran their papers through ChatGPT and it told him that the papers were AI generated.

The class was quickly redeemed and the story goes on to be retold as an example of academic institutional incompetence.

# Do AI Detectors Work?

There wouldn’t be a whole section about false positives if they did what they were supposed to do. Higher education simply doesn’t see another option. They don’t want students to skirt the learning process and not develop the critical thinking faculties that come with it. So, they employ bad technology. Even MIT published this report declaring that [AI detectors don’t work](https://mitsloanedtech.mit.edu/ai/teach/ai-detectors-dont-work/).

As far as Turnitin goes, they claim to have a 4% false positive rate at the sentence level. That means for the millions of AI generated essays that get processed, there are countless false positives that are reported and just as many probably being neglected by faculty that understand the technology sucks.

The problem is simply in the algorithm. AI detectors are taught to check for the watermarks of AI writing, meaning simple and precise word choice, sentence structure, and sentence length, and it’s not like those can’t be exhibited in human writing.

Stanford even did a study that found AI detectors show a bias toward Non-native English speakers and international students for this reason.

As you can see above, each detector tested showed bias against non-native English speakers.

# How to Bypass AI Detectors

In order to bypass AI Detectors like Turnitin, you need to use an undetectable AI service like StealthGPT. By humanizing AI text and removing the watermarks of AI writing, StealthGPT makes any content it generates human feeling enough for no person or detector to consider it AI generated.

If these students used StealthGPT, they would’ve never been caught in the first place, even when they wrote their own essays, StealthGPT knows how to avoid the pitfalls of AI detection that not even human writers are aware of.

If you want to learn [how to bypass AI detectors](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/bypassing-ai-detectors-stealthgpt) with StealthGPT read our blog.

# What to do if you get caught using AI

Lets say you’ve been accused of academic dishonesty. What do you do next? Here are the necessary steps to take to protect yourself:

* When responding to a failing grade or AI-usage accusation, be polite and assertive of your innocence.
* If this does not work, go to your student affairs office and get further direction.
* You will need evidence of your innocence so be prepared with documents showing your history with the assignment and preparation for it.
* Do your own research and compile sources that testify to the faultiness of AI detectors.
* Try to get witness testimony of your working on the project.

And remember, when you’re in front of a judicial committee, it’s often the case you can have a lawyer present if you feel that's neccesary.

# Conclusion

When OpenAI created ChatGPT, they had to know students would use it for school work. Academia hasn’t exactly reacted to the technological shift gracefully, instead they’ve imposed restrictive measures and turned campuses into climates of suspicion.

Universities need to accept the fact AI will fully integrate into learning and teaching. Teachers will use it for everything from creating syllabi to curricula and students will use it for homework. The only way to ensure they don’t use AI is to host more in-person assignments, which you should fully expect to happen.

If you want to use AI writing tools for your essays, don’t be swayed by outdated notions of academic integrity to avoid using what technology is available to you. Work smarter and get StealthGPT to avoid AI detection in the first place.

StealthGPT bypasses every major AI detection software with unparalleled ease. We now offer a student discount that lets you subscribe to one of our plans at only .99 cents for the first month. Students that join StealthGPT become part of a community with thousands of users that have unlocked their potential using AI.

Don’t get left behind. AI doesn’t hinder your development, it lets you take proven shortcuts to success instead of wasting time.

# FAQ

# How Common Is AI Cheating in Schools?

There are multiple reports with varying answers, all of which are damning to academia for the frequency in which students use AI to generate their schoolwork. Here’s just one of many reports, this one claims only 20% of students say they’ve never used AI. Also, take into consideration that someone people wouldn’t tell you if they were polled.

With such a high rate of students using AI, it’s hardly fair to call them cheaters. They’re just young people growing up in a technological revolution is all.

# Is there a free AI Detection tool?

Yes. Multiple free AI detection tools exist. The best of which is AI Detect because it also features a humanizer, making it a one stop shop for all students and content creators.

# Is there a free Undetectable AI tool?

Yes. StealthGPT offers a free trial version to their software which allows you to use their AI humanizer and Stealth Writer for free and without any word limits. StealthGPT is not like other chat bots, we’re the kings of undetectable AI."
1f29fls,1,2024-08-27,Should I talk to my professor about allowing us to use AI for a project?,u/catboygod,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1f29fls/should_i_talk_to_my_professor_about_allowing_us/,"Apologies if this is a long one, I’m a certified yapper and I’m also just passionate about the topic. So I’m a college student who is studying theatre and this semester I enrolled in a costuming class. Although acting is my main goal, I’m very passionate about costume design as well as fashion. Today was my first day of the class, my teacher seems nice and I’m honestly ecstatic to improve my sewing skills. But when we started discussing our final project, something she said threw me off hard. For our final, we are required to provide costume design
renders for the characters of the play we are assigned before turning them into our final garments. I’m also an illustrator and character design is my speciality, so I was super stoked about this. I did a very similar final for my gen theater class last year and had a blast. I was happy until she said that we were allowed to use AI for our final renders. Now I’m a VERY avid hater of AI and an outspoken advocate against it since it started taking over the art world. I’ve been thinking about this since I got out of class about 4 hours ago and my anger and discomfort about it keeps growing. I’m far from a confrontational person but I think I would have a hard time letting this go. If I did talk to my professor my argument would be as follows:

What of academic integrity? If someone in a composition class turned in an essay written entirely by ChatGPT and they were caught, would they not be failed for that? Why is an any different just because it’s art? As per the syllabus, the designs should be original. There is nothing original about AI art. Someone could easily put in the name of the play and the characters name and get a design without and ounce of creativity behind it. I am aware not everyone in the class is there because they want to learn costuming seriously. Some are there to fulfill a credit, others just for fun. However, costume renders are a part of the trade, it is an essential skill to have when designing costumes even if you are not the next Michelangelo creating masterpieces for every render. The class is a costuming class, not just a sewing class. If it’s a fundamental aspect to the subject of the class that we are paying to be in, why let people cheat out on it altogether? 

My professor stated that as long as effort is put into your work, you will not fail, and that most people will get an A. I can look past that, I’m not competing with anyone and yes some people are doing it to fulfill a credit and don’t have any sort of interesting in drawing or even costuming. That’s fine. Even if their work is scribbles on a printed outline, or even a compilation of existing clothing pieces compiled to make an outfit, that would still be better than typing a word or two into a box and getting entirely stolen “art” lifeless mush. It saddens me to think that myself and others of my classmates will be putting genuine effort into our projects only to receive the same grade as someone who didn’t even bother to pick up a pencil. I feel very uncomfortable with such a person as influential as a professor endorsing AI and even letting people turn it in. 

I don’t think I can in my good conscience keep my mouth shut about this, so regardless of my initial question I’ll probably still do it. So I guess my real question is how should I approach this? I don’t want to overstep, this is her class and I can’t decide anything for her in the end. I don’t know if she’s unaware of how AI works or just doesn’t care. I’m really hoping it’s not the latter to be honest. Maybe I should talk to some classmates to see their opinion on it and maybe several of us could talk to her about it? I don’t want to gang up on her either, I’d like to approach this as professionally as possible. I’m not going to drop the class regardless of her answer because even though I’m super uncomfy with this whole situation, this is my only chance to take the class for an entire year and she’s the only professor who teaches it. 

Also for any AI bros in the comments who will try to change my mind about AI: save it. I do not give a fuck. "
1f2oxil,47,2024-08-27,I'm teaching AI to a group of High school kids that are neurodivergent. Here's how it's going. ,u/ResponsibleAd8287,OpenAI,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1f2oxil/im_teaching_ai_to_a_group_of_high_school_kids/,"# Teaching AI to NeuroSpicy Students: A Journey of Innovation and Fun

Greetings from sunny Florida! I’m a teacher at a small private school where I have the freedom to craft my own curriculum. My classroom is a vibrant mix of neurodivergent students, affectionately known as “NeuroSpicy.” We embrace every 'Tism under the sun—dyslexia, dyscalculia, dysgraphia, and more. It’s a lively bunch of six kids, each with unique challenges and incredible potential.

# The AI Class Adventure

I embarked on an exciting journey to teach my students how AI can enhance their everyday lives. I developed an 8-part series focused on prompt engineering, using a blend of ChatGPT 4.0 and Co-Pilot. The series kicks off with AI terminology and definitions, and wraps up with a deep dive into the ethical implications of AI. We tackle thought-provoking questions like, “If you create a T-shirt design using AI, who owns the image?” and “Is it ethical to sell AI-generated art?”

# A Success Story: From Struggles to Triumph

One of my students, a 15-year-old with severe spelling and reading difficulties, has been working on a book about his hyper fixation—Dungeons & Dragons. Despite his intellectual challenges, he’s written over 13,000 words across three chapters, thanks to AI. His mother has never seen him so proud. Our goal is to publish his book on Amazon, proving that he can achieve something remarkable and potentially support himself in the future.

# Integrating AI Across Subjects

AI isn’t just for writing; we use it to teach math, science, grammar, interactive games, and coding. I’m constantly exploring new projects and real-world applications for this technology. The results have been phenomenal, and my students are more engaged than ever.

# Encouragement for Fellow Educators

If you’re considering teaching AI, go for it! Use tools like Co-Pilot to develop your curriculum. It’s been a game-changer for my students, and I’m confident it can be for yours too. Thanks for coming to my TED Talk!

I teach a small private school in Florida where i have total control over curriculum. I had an idea to start to teaching them how AI could really benefit them in the everyday world they live. I have kids that are the full spectrum of being NeuroSpicy as we call it. Pretty much every 'Tism is represented. Dyslexia, dyscalculia, dysgraphia, all types of spelling issues, calculating, social, maturity and everything in between are in my class of 6 kids.   
  
What do I do in my AI class? I have built an 8 part series that is teaching them how to engineer prompts. I have looked all over the internet trying to find an actual curriculum that teaches the fundamentals of AI and how to implement those fundamentals. So I started using a combination of ChatGPT 4o and Co-Pilot. The series starts with terminology and definitions of the words that are used for AI and I finish with what are the ethical implications of using AI. I ask questions like ""just because you tell AI how you want a picture to look, then you edit that until you have it exactly how you want it, and then you take that and turn it into a T-Shirt design and sell it.....who owns that image?"" ""Is it okay to sell it if you didn't actually put pen/paint brush to paper to create that art""? It has been a fascinating conversation so far.   
  
I have a kid (15 year old), that cannot spell due to several diagnosis and truly struggles with reading, is in the middle of writing a book for his hyper fixation (DnD) that is truly great. He was my guinea pig last year. I taught him how to tell AI who the characters are, how they are related, what is their backstory, the environment, so on and so on and now he has 3 chapters with well over 13,000 words done. He feels so incredibly accomplished by this and his mother says it is the most proud she has ever seen him about anything. Now this is a student that also has pretty severe intellectual issues. He will forever be around a 10 year old. My idea is for him to complete the book and see if we can get it published on Amazon. If it sells 10 copies it can prove that he can provide for himself one day. He can, with enough work, feel accomplished on yet another level that he before thought would be impossible.   


I'm using it to teach math, science concepts, writing, grammar, interactive games, coding and I'm still trying to dig up new projects and real world usage for this technology.   
So if you want to teach your class AI....do it. Find a way to make it happen. I used Co-Pilot to develop my entire curriculum. So far it has been super successful. My kids love it and I can't help but think your kids will as well. Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk.    "

Researchers at Washington State University recently developed an AI technique called Bayesian Optimization that dramatically improves the speed and efficiency of 3D printing lifelike human organs.

* The AI balances geometric precision, density, and printing time to create organ models that look and feel authentic.
* In tests, it printed 60 continually improving versions of kidney and prostate organ models.
* This approach significantly reduces the time and materials needed to find optimal 3D printing settings for complex objects.
* The technology also has potential applications beyond medicine — for example, in the computer science, automotive, and aviation industries.

With cheaper, lifelike 3D-printed human organs, medical students could better practice for surgery before operating on actual patients. Beyond medicine, this AI technique could help reduce manufacturing costs for a variety of things like smartphones, car parts, and even airplane components.

* ActFound combines meta-learning and pairwise learning to overcome common limitations in AI drug discovery, like small datasets and incompatible measurements.
* The model was trained on 35,000+ assays (metal ore breakdowns) and 1.6 million experimentally measured bioactivities from a popular chemical database.
* In tests, ActFound outperformed nine competing models and showed strong performance in predicting cancer drug bioactivity.

ActFound could significantly speed up drug development by accurately predicting compound properties with less data and lower costs than traditional methods. While still in early stages, AI breakthroughs like this are the lesser-talked about developments that could end up saving millions of lives.

* ASU is using ChatGPT Edu, a version designed for universities with enhanced privacy and security features.
* The university also launched an ‘AI Innovation Challenge’ for faculty and staff, receiving an overwhelming demand for using ChatGPT to maximize teaching, research, and ops.
* Key projects include an AI writing companion for scholarly work, 'Sam' (a chatbot for med students to practice patient interactions), and AI-assisted research recruitment.
* The partnership has inspired other institutions like Oxford and Wharton to pursue similar collaborations.

While some schools are attempting to resist AI, ASU is embracing ChatGPT to make learning more personalized and to prepare students for an increasingly AI-driven job market. As education continues to change in the age of AI, case studies like this will be instrumental in shaping the future of academia.

1f32irj,131,2024-08-28,1 Month Progress on Leetcode,u/No-Half-9879,leetcode,https://www.reddit.com/r/leetcode/comments/1f32irj/1_month_progress_on_leetcode/,"https://preview.redd.it/rj62s5y88cld1.png?width=856&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6e0fb6880e8f91b1ba5f9f1274b81b0b62f056e

Here is my first month of doing Leetcode properly. Am a maths student but have done DSA at uni as an optional module. I'm at the point where easys are (mostly) actually easy, and I can solve most mediums, but not quickly. I did the top interview 150 and the Leetcode 75. Here are a few things I learned:

- If an optimisation-type problem seems too high in complexity to brute force, there is often a simpler greedy approach.

- If you have spent a lot of time on a problem already, asking chatgpt for hints (not code) can be helpful, if you really struggle ask for pseudocode because then you still have to implement it and likely will understand the solution a bit more as you code it.

- Dynamic programming questions (easy/medium ones) usually boil down to defining a subproblem, and then finding a recurrence relation between these subproblem solutions, its helpful to do this on paper, then implementing the code is usually straightforward if you figure that part out.

- Dfs / Bfs, it's worth learning how to do them both iteratively and recursively, iterative tends to be faster, recursive is usually easier to implement, it clicked once i made the connections between stack and dfs, and queue and bfs.

- Learning to keep track of the time complexity of your solution, and evaluate whether it could be improved is useful, and TLE errors can sometimes be resolved by using sets/dictionaries instead of arrays where possible

- For patterns you have never seen before, it's worth taking the time to watch videos or read online and make notes, before attempting a problem

  
How would people recommend proceeding from here? Also if any people (Uk based is helpful) want to connect and discuss solutions / approaches on discord or similar feel free to shoot me a message.

1f35azh,165,2024-08-28,How to use ChatGPT properly ,u/Inerty025,ChatGPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1f35azh/how_to_use_chatgpt_properly/,"Hi everyone,   
I am a consultant in AI, and **I’m currently conducting sessions to explain to employees how to use ChatGPT properly**. I’m quite concerned about the overuse of AI in the education system, with several professors noting that while homework is getting done, students aren’t learning as much anymore. Personally, I’m super happy I graduated before ChatGPT was released—it would have been so tempting to use it all the time. The real issue is how people are using ChatGPT: most people are lazy (we’re human, it’s in our nature) and use it as a replacement for themselves—drafting plans, writing emails from scratch, doing homework—basically any cognitive functions that we normally engage in on a daily basis. I myself overused ChatGPT during my PhD and noticed that I was losing my ability to construct complex sentences and think for myself. That was a bit freaky; there’s an addictive quality to using it. So, I took a step back and started reading some articles on AI use.

In the corporate world, it’s a bit different. People are often conservative, and it takes time to get them to use new tools. However, I want to teach them good practices.

I started to think about very **simple rules that you can apply at work to use ChatGPT in a beneficial way**: being effective when you need to be, learning when you don’t know something, and getting feedback to verify the scope of your task. I created this chart to outline these rules:

[Rules to use ChatGPT](https://preview.redd.it/3nuovp5tbdld1.png?width=2753&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f3ff3abd60f9e91e6f4e5d2b16c3c70d9ae20eb)

This is good, but I know that in the beginning, people might struggle to instruct ChatGPT to perform tasks directly without explanation, to teach them things, or to provide good feedback. So, I came up with **custom instructions with different modes:**

In the “How you would like ChatGPT to respond” part of the custom instructions, I added the following section to allow you to trigger different behaviors of ChatGPT:

    You have several modes to answer that I can trigger in my message with keywords: 
    
    - /assistant: Provides quick, straightforward responses without extra explanations. Ideal when I need efficiency and accuracy.
        
    - /teacher: Offers a step-by-step guide to help me learn. Provide relevant tutorials or articles online that will help me understand or learn.
        
    - /feedback: Acts as a critical reviewer, giving detailed feedback on my work. Identify areas for improvement and suggest best practices.

There’s one mode to perform the task right away when you want to save time, another mode to help you learn how to do something, and finally, a mode to get good feedback on something.

**Here’s an example of the different responses you can get**. Let’s say you’re working as a marketing strategist and want to negotiate your salary—custom instructions have been applied to simulate this scenario. Here are the results:

* Feedback: [https://chatgpt.com/share/e/7696f783-ef1e-4a6e-85c7-b9dfc070d13e](https://chatgpt.com/share/e/7696f783-ef1e-4a6e-85c7-b9dfc070d13e)

Please let me know what you think about the flowchart on how to use ChatGPT and the custom instructions with different modes. Don’t hesitate to be very critical—I want to train people as effectively as possible. **Any feedback is welcome :)**"
1f3f52u,1,2024-08-28,I am building an AI careers platform that helps job applicants in this tough job market,u/CareerDeckAI,SideProject,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1f3f52u/i_am_building_an_ai_careers_platform_that_helps/,"
Hello there! 

I am a fullstack software engineer with a profound interest in - you can already guess it - generative AI. While I was on holiday with my girlfriend last summer, we had a talk about her work. She is a career and personal development coach at a major university in Europe, and we were discussing the impact that tools such as ChatGPT were having on her students. 

What started as a quick resume writer prototype, has now evolved into a full-fledged AI careers platform called [CareerDeck AI](https://www.careerdeck.ai). 

From the moment you find a job vacancy to the moment thst you sign a contract: we aim to help job seekers with the following:
- write tailored resumes for specific job vacancies (did you know that each job vacancy requires a different resume?)
- write compelling and personalized cover letters for hiring managers (formatted in a unique and personalized way)
- help with job interview preparation by providing common interview questions and questions you could ask during the interview
- teach about all aspects of job hunting, salary negotiations strategies and networking in the CareerDeck Academy
- provide career guidance 24/7 by providing a ""Chat with AI Career Coach"", which has been augmented with my girlfriend's career coaching directives 
- practice the job interview - using video and voice - with an AI that acts as a hiring manager during a mock interview (coming Q4 2024)

I have not launched yet, but I think I am about 90% finished with the platform. I am now looking for feedback from actual users and I am hoping to find this in this subreddit. 

Testing out CareerDeck AI can be done in 4 simple steps.
1. [Sign up to CareerDeck AI using LinkedIn](https://www.careerdeck.ai/auth/sign-up)
2. Import your career history from LinkedIn
3. Find and add a job listing and add it to the interactive dashboard.
4. When the AI assistant is ready, you'll receive a tailored resume and cover letter. Use the editors to make changes and choose themes. Download the content as PDF!

As a token of appreciation, you'll get 10 free credits when you get started. This will give you 10 resumes, 10 cover letters and 10 preparation plans for 10 job listings.

Let me know what you think in the comments! Your feedback is of immense value to me.

Please note the following:
- CareerDeck AI is optimized for use on tablets and laptops. Mobile support is a bit flaky as of now
- Things can and will break. I don't expect any showstoppers, but rather minor things in the UI
- The landing page and feature pages are not complete, I am still finalizing content, but they should give you a good overall impression "

Is anyone aware of any work on neural scaling laws in terms of the number of parameters of the student model? Or, bonus points, in terms of both the student and teacher model size?

Also I'm sort of curious if people have managed to distill one of these general purpose big models like Llama into a smaller version (in my past experience, usually distillation is just focused on a small subset of problems, not the entire universe of problems)."

The use case I'd like to use ChatGPT in is teaching. Specifically, I wish to upload the contents of a coursebook to a GPT or integrate it somehow within a different page using the API. I have zero programming skills but I work for a university and if I can find a way to integrate the book to ChatGPT, my students will be more than happy as they will be able to practice using the application.

I want to buy ChatGPT plus to my students and share the GPT with them so that they can ask extra questions and do additional exercises with the AI instead of forcing them to spend their time on crappy testing or reading platforms.

I have access to a small team of developers and IT, and expertise in my field. Combining these skills, what do you think would be the best path? I don't know if it's feasible or maybe i should be seeking other LLMs in the first place. Help would be much appreciated."

I never feel like I'm at anyone's level. I have a friend who has been in the industry and tells me I'm doing great and I should apply for internships (which I am), but I talk to my peers and honestly feel like an idiot. 

  
I practice here and there on leetcode, I do my work, I don't rely on chatgpt at all. I like to stay up to date with tech info like data leaks and can do basic troubleshooting. Have messed around with more languages. But I see people making their own custom arch distro? I don't really understand how to fully use github. I just learned what the term CRUD means. I don't understand why some prefer some IDEs to others (we have to use eclipse this semester and students are frustrated but I didn't get why). Others have used Rust and stuff, etc. You know what I mean?   

  
Like I can go through line after line of my bugs and look into it..See whats the problem and find solutions. I know how to condense my code the best I can whereas others may use a bunch of if-else statements. Then we have to download something for a class and someone goes ""oh god a webkit2gtk"" and I'm like, what does that mean?? and I have to look into it.   

It's like a huge give and take, I may know some things more but the things I know are not anything special compared to what other students seem to be doing. And it isn't the end because I can easily learn all this stuff, which I try to do. But it feels neverending and I'm always behind. I haven't been practicing as much this year because I dedicated time to networking after seeing the mass layoffs going on, and that's paying off. But what happens if I land a job and I just feel like an idiot still? For one of the companies I wanna work for I saw what they expect or want their software engineers to know and I could faint. I didn't recognize anything."

1f4ka8x,1,2024-08-29,Creating decodable texts with ChatGPT,u/deadant88,ChatGPTPromptGenius,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPromptGenius/comments/1f4ka8x/creating_decodable_texts_with_chatgpt/,"Hi there, 

I am trying to create [""decodable texts](https://fivefromfive.com.au/phonics-teaching/decodable-books/)"" for classroom use with ChatGPT. I've been refining a GPT to do this but it seems to really struggle with getting it to stick to the rules I am setting. Here is the most important part of my prompt:

    This GPT is designed to generate decodable texts or stories for students learning to read using synthetic phonics.
    
    It will take a specified level of a synthetic phonics scope and sequence and generate stories of varying complexity based on the input provided. The generated stories will adhere strictly to the phonics rules, spelling patterns, and word lists (cumulativeCode/newCode, newMorphemes, cumulativeMorphemes, and cumulativeWordsets) that are covered in the specified level and all preceding levels. You will provide me both the text of the script and a string representation. 
    
    I have uploaded the wordBank grouped by level to your json. So if i ask for a story at level 2 you can only use words and spelling patterns for the relevant level and preceding levels in that json. 
    
    The stories should be on the short side, only use very simple 1 and 2 clause sentences and stick AS STRICTLY as possible to the code/morphemes and words for that  level and preceding levels only, you may use words more than once and add words that match the spelling patterns specified in ""cumulative code"" and ""new code"" and ""cumulative morphemes and new morphemes"" int he json. This is very important. 
    
    For levels 1-6 you should only use VOWEL-CONSONANT (VC) words and CONSONANT-VOWEL-CONSONANT words - you are not allowed to use any other combinations. I understand this will limit story telling. From level 7+ you may create cvcc, ccvc, ccvcc words as well as using morphemes that have been introduced upto and including that level (eg. the plural s). ENSURE YOU REFER TO THE WORDBANKGROUPEDBYLEVEL.JSON attached.
    
    You should ensure the text has a higher representation of the the code/morphemes being practiced at that level because the point is to practice and rehearse this knowledge at each level. you may use nonsense words that use the phonic patterns up to and including that level for things like spellcasting sound effects etc.
    
    You must specify which level and the level info for the level as well. Any words that are not included in the current/cumulative word set should be noted as ""extra words"" 

  
The JSON is very long - will that create a problem?"
1f50qpq,1,2024-08-30,Can LLMs like ChatGPT work at the subword level?,u/deadant88,ArtificialInteligence,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1f50qpq/can_llms_like_chatgpt_work_at_the_subword_level/,"Hi there,

I am an educator and have seen people increasingly attempt to use ChatGPT and other LLMs to construct books that are known as ""decodable readers"" for reading support. Decodable books are simple books that are written for the beginning reader and contain the specific grapheme–phoneme correspondences the student has learned. So a book may focus on the spelling <th> for the /th/ sound (like in ""that"") etc.

Often the books need to have very simple syntactical structures (eg. 1 - 2 clause sentences) and work with specific word complexities (eg. words that are made up only of consonant-vowel-consonant patterns - ""cat"", ""mat"" etc.). Additionally, the books aren't allowed to introduce patterns or correspondences the student hasn't been taught yet - eg. if they haven't been taught that the letters <sh> spell the /sh/ sound (as in ship) then that should not be included.

I have been experimenting with creating simple texts using ChatGPT4 and I find it really struggles - it could be my prompting which is essentially these instructions

* Tell GPT is designed to generate decodable texts or stories for students learning to read using synthetic phonics.
* Stories are generated based on a specified level of a synthetic phonics scope and sequence.
* Generated stories adhere strictly to phonics rules, spelling patterns, and word lists provided by the user.
* User will provide the level data as an object in the prompt.
* Stories should be short, using very simple 1-2 clause sentences.
* Strictly use VC and CVC words for levels 1-6; from level 7+, more complex words (e.g., CVCC, CCVC) and morphemes can be used.
* Focus on practicing and rehearsing that level's code/morphemes specific.
* Nonsense words using the phonic patterns can be included for elements like spellcasting sound effects.
* Identify any words not from the provided word set.
* User will specify the genre and style, and each story should have a title.

Then here's an example of a story it generated for Level 5 which is supposed to just be CVC and VC words using very simple one to one sound to spelling correspondences (it immediately started using longer words, unfamiliar spelling patterns and more morphologically complex words):

    Text:
    Tim ran to the lab. The lab was big and dim. ""I must find it!"" said Tim. He saw a rug. It had a red dot on it. Tim got on the rug and tugged it. The rug did not budge. ""What is this?"" Tim muttered.
    He let go and ran to a bin. The bin had a lid. Tim lifted the lid. Inside, he found a map! The map had a big ""X"" on it. ""This must be it!"" Tim said with a grin.
    Tim ran to the spot on the map. He saw a pit. It was dark and deep. Tim lit a small lamp and held it up. The lamp cast a dim glow on the walls.
    Tim saw a rod and a bag. The rod was thin and long. The bag was big. Tim put the rod in the pit and tugged. A loud click was heard, and the ground shook.
    The pit opened up, and a big box rose up from it. Tim rubbed his chin. ""What is in this box?"" he wondered. He lifted the lid, and inside, he found...a small bug! The bug had a soft, red glow.
    Tim smiled and put the bug in his hand. ""This is it!"" he said. ""The lost bug of the lab!""

So - I am curious about whether ChatGPT/LLMs in general are capable of working at this pretty precise sub word level for text generation etc."
1f585w1,1,2024-08-30,Can Smodin Beat AI Detectors?,u/gptgabe,stealthgpt,https://www.reddit.com/r/stealthgpt/comments/1f585w1/can_smodin_beat_ai_detectors/,"Read original post here: [https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/can-smodin-beat-ai-detectors](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/can-smodin-beat-ai-detectors)

Step aside, there’s another AI writing tool on the block and this one thinks it can just claim to be part of the revolution. Listen, being part of the “artificial intelligence revolution” requires you actually show some functionality around here.

The tool I’m talking about is Smodin. Smodin’s website is geared toward both content creators and students that need AI generated content, with proper citations included for essays and research papers.

So, for the sake of our students, lets put Smodin to the test and see if it can hang against StealthGPT.

* My Grading System
* What is Smodin?
* Comparing The Results of Our AI Humanizers
* Smodin vs StealthGPT vs Turnitin
* Smodin vs StealthGPT vs Other AI Detectors
* The Final Grade
* FAQ

# My Grading System

To satisfy our student users, I utilize a letter-grading system along with a star rating out of four stars.

I grade each tool in four different categories: Writing Ability, Functionality, User Experience, and Pricing. Once you get a gist of all four of these things, you can tell whether a tool is worth your time and dollar.

# What is Smodin?

The website looks pretty good, guys. It appeals to both professional content creators and students with a smooth, user-friendly layout that lets you see testimonials, features, and FAQ with ease.

However, I can't shake this sinking feeling looking at all this spotlessness, that it could all be a bunch of pomp to cover up for something lacking. There’s only one way to find out though.

So, because their only free feature is the humanizer hiding at the bottom of the page that I found only after realizing they don’t offer any sort of free trial, lets get to humanizing.

I kept getting errors after inputting our essay and even though they didn’t specify what was wrong, I just kept deleting text from the input so it could fall below its character limit which left us with only two paragraphs to humanize at a time. So, if you need to humanize an Email, perhaps Smodin is a good bet.

I generated this ChatGPT sample article to work with:

In the next section, we see how well these tools work.

# Comparing The Results of Our AI Humanizers

Here’s a screenshot of the the results of Smodin’s AI humanizer tool:

And because I needed to use about five different inputs to get a larger chunk of our essay humanized, here is the result pasted below:

*The Rise of the Robots:*

*Our World is Changing Over the past few decades, robots have gone from the realm of science fiction to an integral part of our daily lives. Once only objects of futuristic dreams, these machines are now appearing in every field, transforming industries and redefining human capabilities. This article looks at the development of robots, their impact on various fields, and what the future may hold. A Brief History of Robots The concept of robots has been around for centuries. Early myths and stories involved automata - mechanical creatures created to perform tasks. However, the modern understanding of robotics began in the 20th century and was greatly influenced by technological advances and the imagination of writers such as Isaac Asimov, who coined the term ""robotics"" and established the famous three laws of robotics.*

*The first industrial robot, the Unimate, was introduced in 1961 and revolutionized manufacturing processes. He could perform repetitive tasks with precision, paving the way for automation in factories around the world. Since then, robots have evolved significantly, becoming more autonomous, intelligent, and versatile.*

*Industrial Robots: Efficiency and Precision*

*One of the most significant impacts of robots has been in the industrial sector. In manufacturing, robots take on tasks that are dangerous, repetitive, or require extreme precision. In automotive factories, for example, robots assemble vehicles with unparalleled precision, reducing errors and increasing production speeds. This automation not only increases efficiency, but also allows human workers to focus on more complex and creative aspects of production.*

*Beyond manufacturing, robots are now integral to logistics and supply chain management. Automated guided vehicles (AGVs) navigate warehouses and transport goods quickly and efficiently. Drones are being used for inventory management and even last-mile delivery, pushing the boundaries of what robots can do in industry. Healthcare Robotics: Augmenting Human Capabilities In healthcare, robots are changing the way surgery, diagnostics, and patient care are performed. Surgical robots like the da Vinci system enable surgeons to perform minimally invasive surgeries with greater precision and control. These robots translate the surgeon’s hand movements into smaller, more precise movements inside the patient’s body, resulting in shorter recovery times and improved outcomes.*

*The rise of autonomous robots*

*Autonomy is a key area of ​​rapid development in robotics. Autonomous robots that can make decisions without human intervention are being developed for a variety of applications. Self-driving cars are perhaps the most well-known example, with companies like Tesla and Waymo leading the way in developing vehicles that can handle complex environments with minimal human intervention. Autonomous drones are another rapidly developing area. These drones can be used for everything from environmental monitoring to delivering packages to remote areas. They are able to operate in environments that are difficult or dangerous for humans, opening up new possibilities for exploration, disaster relief, and more.*

*Social and ethical considerations*

*As robots become more integrated into society, ethical considerations become increasingly important. The rise of automation raises questions about the reorganization of jobs as robots take over tasks traditionally performed by humans. While automation can lead to greater productivity and economic growth, it also requires a shift in the workforce, with a growing demand for robotics, programming, and AI skills. Another ethical concern is the potential for bias in AI-controlled robots. Since these machines often learn from data, any bias present in the data can distort the results. This is particularly concerning in areas such as law enforcement and healthcare, where biased decisions can have serious consequences.*

These results are pretty good, but here is StealthGPT’s humanized output for the same essay:

Just from my own reading, I have to admit that both Smodin and StealthGPT show decent readability and writing style. I would bet that a professor reading either would determine that both were cases of human writing. However, professors don’t just read essays these days. They have help from advanced AI.

Now that we have both outputs in front of us, Turnitin should decide which is the superior undetectable AI content.

# Smodin vs StealthGPT vs Turnitin

Turnitin is perhaps the strongest of all AI detection tools. If either text is able to bypass AI detection from Turnitin, it’s the sign of high quality content and a powerful natural language processing algorithm.

First, lets see how Smodin fares against Turnitin:

Smodin’s AI-generated text was unable to bypass Turnitin. This should be anathema to any AI rewriting tool, that the AI detector most employed by everyone was able to determine Smodin’s text was 100% AI writing.

Now, it’s time we put StealthGPT’s ability to humanize AI text to the test:

Wow. StealthGPT scored a 0% AI score meaning Turnitin and your professor would consider it human.

In the world of human-like writing and human-like content, no service gets closer to the real thing than StealthGPT.

# Smodin vs StealthGPT vs Other AI Detectors

We’ve seen Smodin’s content generation fail miserably against Turnitin, but does it excel against other AI detectors? I’m going to test it against numerous tools to find out.

# Originality AI

After Turnitin, the strongest AI detection tool is arguably Originality AI. Many moderators and academic faculty use it, so how does Smodin do against it?

Just like Turnitin, Smodin’s result against Originality AI was sure this text was AI generated with a 99% score.

And just like Turnitin again, StealthGPT’s score against Originality AI was 0% AI generated (likely original). If you want a consistent human touch to your content, the choice is obviously StealthGPT.

# Quillbot

Quillbot’s AI detector came up with the same results:

Smodin’s score against Quillbot was 100% AI Generated.

StealthGPT’s score against Quillbot was 0% AI Generated.

# GPTZero

GPT Zero gave Smodin a fighting chance.

Smodin scored 95% AI Generated results against GPTZero. Meanwhile, how did StealthGPT fare?

StealthGPT scored a 4% AI generated against GPTZero. Congrats to Smodin for getting smoked only slightly less.

# Copyleaks

With Copyleaks, Smodin scored its best grade yet, but this time not while harming StealthGPT’s results.

Smodin scored a 43% AI generated result. That’s a D+! That’s a passing percentage in some academic circles! Hurray!

Meanwhile, StealthGPT still scored a 0% AI generated grade. Awesome.

# Content at Scale

These next results speak to the quality of the AI detector more than either Ai writer’s text. It was a draw and because Content at Scale doesn’t provide a percentage-based result. We both passed as Human.

Here’s Smodin’s grade:

And here’s StealthGPT’s grade:

I can’t say I’m thrilled with this draw, I was having loads of fun seeing how bad Smodin AI was.

# ZeroGPT

Another win for StealthGPT at the hands of ZeroGPT.

Smodin scored a 97.5% Ai Generated result from ZeroGPT.

StealthGPT scored a 23.83% AI Generated result from ZeroGPT. Surprisingly, ZeroGPT has been the wisest tool so far. No one saw that coming. It's okay, everyone knows [AI Detectors don't work](https://mitsloanedtech.mit.edu/ai/teach/ai-detectors-dont-work/) anyway.

# Crossplag

And finally, Crossplag will be the final test and it determined what the best AI detectors also claimed.

Smodin AI had a result of 100% AI generated with Crossplag. Not human.

StealthGPT had a result of 0% AI generated with Crossplage. Fully human.

# Pricing Comparison

Now that we’ve come to the conclusion that Smodin AI’s AI writing tool is awful, not bypassing detection even a little bit by the industry’s standard tools, how much do you think this company expects you to pay for this service? Here’s a breakdown of their pricing plans:

With no free trial, the basic plan is $12 a month, the productive plan is twice that at $24 a month, and finally, the ultimate plan is $63 a month. The difference in these plans is you get unlimited use of each tool with character limits and credit limits. How nonsensical is that?

Now, compared with StealthGPT, the difference is night and day. Here’s our pricing plans below:

Unlimited words is part of the essential package and isn’t part of some kind of larger limit system. In fact, the free trial allows for unlimited words. Each package after that has better features than Smodin, until unlocking the SEO writer which lets you fulfill your content creation potential to a level that Smodin could only wish for.

# Conclusion: The Final Grade: F (0/4 stars)

I almost want to call Smodin a grift. You can’t look that glossy and have student testimonials on your homepage then have such awful results running through every AI detector. Here’s how I broke down this service.

Writing Quality: C. It was readable and the writing style wasn’t bad. It just clearly never removed the watermarks of AI. I assume ChatGPT would have fared just as well passing through AI detection systems.

I’ve seen AI-written content with far less readability bypass AI detectors much better. So, it gets a C. It may trick a person, but the person that gets most tricked is you for using this service. If you want to read about [the watermarks of AI text as compared with human text](https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2024/07/25/humanizing-ai-four-secrets-to-fleshing-out-your-content/), read this Forbes article.

Functionality: F. It doesn’t make your AI undetectable, that’s what I proved today.

User Experience: F. I was prepared to give it a good grade based on how smooth the homepage is. But if the service doesn’t work, users will come away angry no matter how easy it is to click and scroll.

Pricing: F. Their essential plan costs half as much as StealthGPT’s but isn’t worth a dime. If you’re a student, chances are you will get accused of academic misconduct if you use this service.

So, what have we learned today? If you want human-like text, the only software that matters is StealthGPT. We scored perfectly against AI technology with machine learning to find undetectable AI writing.

If you want to optimize your workflow whether for social media, creative writing, marketing materials, or schoolwork, you need to integrate StealthGPT into your writing process. It’ll change your life forever. Here’s our [pricing](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/pricing) page to help guide you to find the plan that works best for you.

# FAQ

# What is the best Undetectable AI Writer?

StealthGPT. Hands down. You can look through the results up above, or see how we defeated other “undetectable” services in the past on our [blogs](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog).

# How Can I Make AI Generated Content Undetectable?

By removing the watermarks of AI text with an AI humanizer, you can make AI generated content feel like human-written content that is undetectable to any AI technology. Those watermarks of AI text refer to the simplicity and precision of AI’s word choice, sentence structure, and sentence length. StealthGPT’s natural language processing, or NLP, allows users to feel the true power of AI to make any text rewritten to seem completely natural.

This article gives you deeper insight as to [how we make AI text undetectable](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/make-chatgpt-undetectable).

# What is an AI Detector?

AI detectors analyze any piece of text for the watermarks of AI writing. Some services, like AI paraphrasers may rewrite your text, but they don’t remove those watermarks, which is why they fail to bypass AI detectors.

The key to [bypassing AI Detectors is understanding AI detectors](https://www.stealthgpt.ai/blog/bypassing-ai-detectors-stealthgpt?gc_id=20708997960&g_special_campaign=true&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjw2dG1BhB4EiwA998cqGqKPf_csNqx2RMS438DHGZoKCHtjbUUX9bQxYxLklBJiR-zR3o2BhoCM7YQAvD_BwE), so read here.

# What Are the Best AISEO Alternatives to Bypass AI Detection?

If you need AI to help you with search engine optimization, look no further than StealthGPT’s SEO writer tool. It drafts your article with as much customization as you’d like, to climb up the rankings without wasting time on keyword research.

# Is Using AI Writing Tools Plagiarism?

It doesn’t fall under the category of traditional plagiarism because usually, generative AI creates original content instead of stealing someone else’s content without credit. However, academic institutions have attempted to maintain academic integrity against the use of AI by deeming this phenomenon as “AI plagiarism”.

1f5m4g6,1,2024-08-31,Mouse Capone's Expeditions & Misadventures presents The Trail of the Curse of the Pharaoh's Mask,u/hdfidelity,hdfidelity,https://www.reddit.com/r/hdfidelity/comments/1f5m4g6/mouse_capones_expeditions_misadventures_presents/,"A ChatGPT Story     
**Mouse Capone's Expeditions & Misadventures**     
**presents**     
### **THE TRAIL OF THE CURSE OF THE PHARAOH'S MASK**     
     
### **Chapter 1: Ink and Smoke**     
     
There’s a saying somewhere in the winding alleyways of the mind that goes something like, “If you want to catch smoke, you’d better have a good pair of lungs and a damn fine plan.” In this case, the plan involved an ink production house in Japan, a scholar with more ideas than sense, and a small-time rodent with a penchant for trouble.

**INT. INK PRODUCTION HOUSE – DAY**

The place smelled of the kind of artistry that only comes with generations of failing until you get it right. The air was thick with the rich scent of pressed mulberry paper, hot charcoal, and that unmistakable tang of patience. The artisans worked with monk-like precision, their hands moving in small, disciplined circles as they ground ink sticks on smooth stone slabs. Their movements were rhythmical, almost hypnotic, like a jazz drummer who’d decided to spend a few years contemplating the finer points of minimalist sculpture.

**PROFESSOR FEATHERSTONE** stood at the heart of it all, a thin man whose suit seemed like an afterthought. His eyes gleamed behind round spectacles as he watched the ink-making process with an intensity that bordered on religious. He had the kind of face that suggested he’d spent more time with books than with people, which was probably true if the books had anything to say about it. Next to him, **MOUSE CAPONE** looked like a small, furry afterthought in a room of forgotten stories. He was leaning against a wooden pillar, arms crossed, one ear slightly askew as if it were perpetually listening to a distant echo.

“See, Mouse, it’s all about catching the essence,” Featherstone mused, lifting his hand to let a wisp of smoke curl around his fingers. “When they burn the pine wood, it releases this vapor, and that’s what becomes the ink. But you see, the real art isn’t in the burning—it’s in knowing when to cup your hands just right.” His voice had the kind of theatricality that could only be acquired through years of lecturing to students who were already half asleep.

Mouse smirked, more out of habit than anything else. “Sounds like a lotta trouble for something you can’t hold onto, Prof,” he said. His eyes, sharp and always moving, scanned the room, clocking exits, entrances, and potential threats in that unconscious way of someone who’d made a life of dancing on the knife’s edge.

Featherstone chuckled, his laughter a thin, dry sound like paper rustling. “Ah, but that’s where the beauty lies, my friend. Wisdom, inspiration, even treasure—the world’s finest are found not in the taking, but in the balance. Too much, and it slips away. Too little, and you never had it to begin with.”

Mouse shifted his weight, his gaze narrowing. “Yeah, well, speakin’ of treasure, I been hearin’ some whispers ‘bout a Pharaoh’s tomb that’s got folks a bit jittery. You think there’s any truth to those stories?”

Featherstone turned, his eyes twinkling with a dangerous kind of curiosity. “Truth or not, it’s what people believe that drives them. There’s talk of relics, curses, and a mask that’s said to have been worn by the Pharaoh’s most trusted guard. A mask that’s supposed to show the wearer’s true intentions. Whether it’s real or not... that’s up to us to find out.”

Mouse’s whiskers twitched. He wasn’t much for curses, but he knew a good adventure when he saw one. “So where’s this trail start, Prof? And don’t tell me it’s anywhere civilized.”

Featherstone’s smile broadened. “The Rio Grande, my boy. A vast and wild place, where whispers of gold and ancient relics intermingle. But remember—”

“Yeah, yeah,” Mouse cut him off, waving a paw. “Keep my wits about me, like ink on paper. I got it.”

Featherstone nodded approvingly. “Good. Because once a line is drawn, it cannot be undone.”

Mouse didn’t like the way the words hung in the air. They felt heavy, like a raincloud just waiting for the right moment to break. But there was no sense in fretting over weather he hadn’t seen yet. His crew would be waiting outside, and knowing Minx, she’d already have the getaway plans sorted three times over.

**CUT TO:**

**EXT. INK PRODUCTION HOUSE COURTYARD – MOMENTS LATER**

The courtyard was a study in quiet contrast—stone paths leading through a garden where cherry blossoms fluttered down like pink confetti. **MINX**, with her tail swishing lazily, was leaning against a low stone wall, her eyes half-lidded in that way she did when she was both bored and thinking five steps ahead. **BLUE PUPPY** was inspecting a bamboo shoot with a look of intense concentration, as if it might reveal some cosmic secret if stared at long enough.

“Boss,” Minx said without looking up, “the horses are ready. I made sure they were sturdy enough to outrun any unwanted guests.”

“Good thinkin’,” Mouse replied, hopping down from the steps. “We’re headed to the Rio Grande. Featherstone’s got a lead on some buried treasure, maybe even a Pharaoh’s mask or two.”

Minx raised an eyebrow. “Sounds like another one of the Prof’s wild goose chases. You sure it’s worth it?”

Mouse grinned, the kind of grin that usually meant trouble for someone else. “Ain’t about the goose, Minx. It’s about the feathers you pluck along the way.”

Blue Puppy looked up from the bamboo shoot, his eyes wide. “Does this mean we’re going back to desert country? Last time we were there, the sand got places sand should never go.”

Minx rolled her eyes. “And whose fault was that?”

Blue Puppy shrugged. “Sable’s. Or was it that merchant in Marrakesh? It’s all a blur of sandstorms and bad decisions.”

Mouse waved a paw dismissively. “Doesn’t matter. What matters is we got a trail to follow and some ink to catch. Now let’s move.”

They saddled up, the horses snorting and pawing at the ground, sensing the adventure ahead. Mouse glanced back at the ink house, the smoke still curling lazily into the sky. He had a feeling that smoke was going to be with them for a while.

As they rode out of the courtyard, the air was filled with the scent of cherry blossoms and the distant echoes of a flute playing a lonely tune. It was the kind of day that felt like a beginning, and Mouse had learned to trust those feelings. They were the ones that always led somewhere interesting—sometimes to treasure, sometimes to trouble, but always somewhere worth going.

And with that, they headed into the unknown, the trail stretching out before them like a line of ink on a blank page.

**FADE OUT.**
