Firstly, I have completed my A-levels and secured a spot at the University of Liverpool on a foundation year in engineering (I did not do Maths A level) which i then would follow on from into an engineering discipline. This was going to be Aerospace but when the time to go to uni arrived I got cold feet and wondered whether there were better options available to me. Although i know i shouldn’t be, i feel very motivated by salaries as I have a deep passion for Cars and would love to be able to own something impressive in the future (along with the financial freedom of course).  Currently, I see a few options for myself. I could wait it out and attend university next year onto my desired course (i could even go to software engineering if that would benefit me more), or I could try my luck at applying to a Digital and Technology solutions apprenticeship near me at a company called CapGemini, where i would gain a degree in Digital and Technology solutions from Aston University. Or, i could go to BAE systems for an aerospace engineering apprenticeship that awards a Beng in Aerospace Engineering and 2 diplomas. Obviously with both apprenticeships i would have the benefit of free tuition, and experience leading into a job at the corresponding company at the end of the apprenticeship. I would have to move away for Liverpool and the BAE systems routes, so that’s another consideration. I want to make the right choice for my life and not feel like later down the line i could’ve made a better decision by either following into a software role or an aerospace one. I feel consumed by researching “average salaries” for everything i consider and i wonder what the benefit of the “traditional” route would give me. I should also probably note that while i do not know how to code now, id be willing to learn if the compensation of becoming a software engineer is good enough. Also, is there any real world difference between the uni you attend? Is there ANY reason for me to go to Liverpool?
I honestly appreciate any wisdom anybody has for me, even if that’s telling me to get my head out of the clouds. 

TLDR - I’ve got my life ahead of me and the idea of regretting doing one thing or another is consuming me into not doing anything at all. I’ve always been a “science” type of person and i’m just desperate to make the most out of my life."
